There are rumors, at least, not only that he's very interested in the trade deal, but he's really anxious to get in the room with Xi Jinping and maybe even to make a visit to China. So that may be yet to come. And if that's the case, maybe that's the explanation for downplaying the China problem or doing- ... for downplaying the China problem or doing small symbolic things like not giving the Taiwanese president the right to stop in the United States on the way going to Europe at that point, lit...

But if that impetus is not now coming from the White House, if the rest of the Republican Party, as they have on every other issue, goes along with Trump, if he now moves in sort of a softer direction towards China, what's going to happen on the Democratic side? You always have in the Democratic Party, people who are more towards the left who don't never like this idea of new Cold War with China, certainly don't want to spend more on defense, sort of come home America, McGovernite wing or fracti...

And also when I did a...

I mean, without China, I don't think the Russians would still be on the battlefield. China's buying, it's buying Russian oil in greater quantities than it was before. It's been buying Russian agricultural products in greater quantities than before. And that's very helpful to the Russians.

Of course, the North Koreans have been selling them artillery shells and so on. T...

But if you have leaders in the United States who are constantly calling this into question, who are engaged in a bizarre attempt to say, black is white and white is black, and Ukraine is the aggressor, and Russia is the poor victim. Who are not willing to talk in terms of values and ideology and the bond that historically we felt we had with other democracies, over time that is going to erode public support. And it probably is beginning to do that. And we've seen that with regard to Russia. Peop...
