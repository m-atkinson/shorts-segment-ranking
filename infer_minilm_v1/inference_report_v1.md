So for them, an occupation is the imposition of a totalitarian regime, and they can’t live there, it will be the end. So they will keep fighting. And for Russia, it remains a war of choice. I mean, it remains something they don’t have to do. It’s a war that’s being fought largely now for the sake of Putin’s ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it’s his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what ...

I mean, we have a lot of leverage on them, but they have no one to negotiate with. I don’t think the Russians are negotiating about anything until they have concluded that they can’t win. And so whatever kind of pressure we can put in them to convince them that we can’t win, that we’re there forever, that we’re not going to abandon the Ukrainians, whatever. I mean, and of course the big wild card here is Trump. We don’t really know what he would do if he won. He’s given lots of pretty negative h...

The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don’t have a choice. So as far as they’re concerned, it’s an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian. The people living on it are put in concentration camps. ...

And that’s not even the dangerous stuff that he does. - speaker: Bill Kristol text: | But, I think it helps him in a weird way. It’s like he’s and interesting and amusing— He can seem to be goofy and maybe too goofy to be president, one might say. But, others will say, “Well, but he thought… he still knows what he’s doing. He’s a business guy.” But, it makes him seem less dangerous, less threatening. I don’t actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all t...

But actually, it’s not clear that they can actually simply outlast Ukraine. You say it’s a world necessity for Ukraine, and things could change in Russia in terms of either Putin or in terms of the economy. And there are other things, and people tend to, I think here, don’t you think much too much to assume that Russia’s the one that’s got just the endless lasting staying power and that it’s Ukraine? - speaker: Anne Applebaum text: | The Russians do lose wars, yeah. I mean, they lost the war in ...
