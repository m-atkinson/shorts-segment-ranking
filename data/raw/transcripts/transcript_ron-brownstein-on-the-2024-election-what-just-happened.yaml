      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . And welcome back to my friend, Ron Brownstein,
      who we’ve had a few of these conversations. One, what, just two, three weeks ago?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So we had an election here on Tuesday—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Pre-earthquake.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … and you’re one of the leading analysts of it, so analyze. What surprised you? What’s most notable?
      And then we’ll go into all kinds of details.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, I mean, to me the most notable thing was the uniformity of what we saw. I believe Trump
      improved his vote share in 49 of the states. The New York Times calculated that 90% of the counties
      in the US moved toward him. The Center for Rural Studies does one of my favorite geographic
      segmenting of the counties from the most urban to the most rural, and Trump improved between three
      and four points in all six of their groupings. And I think that suggests to me that we were not
      looking at an election that was shaped by tactics or message or the answer that Kamala Harris gave
      on The View about continuity with Biden. It was a big shared national experience and a big shared
      national verdict of discontent and disappointment in the outcomes that they had received under the
      Biden administration. Obviously, Biden had a lot of successes legislatively and otherwise, but for
      most Americans, inflation, and secondarily, the border, I think maybe crime, primarily inflation,
      overshadowed all of that and allowed Trump to basically gain everywhere, overcoming all of the kind
      of castle keeps, the last lines of defense the Democrats thought they had built in the swing states.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So let’s just talk about the numbers for a second on the swing. So I think the California votes,
      we’re speaking Friday morning, California vote, pretty good chunk of it’s still outstanding. I think
      we need to factor it in.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, at least 40%.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What do you think, Trump wins the popular vote by 2.5 or so maybe?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I can’t do the math in my head of what it’s going to be. Obviously Trump is going to win the popular
      vote, and as I say—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And a majority, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And majority, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      He’s certainly above 50.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      He’s going to be a first time since Bush.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And he’s at 3% lead of Harris now and I figure that drifts down to…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s going to drift down.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      All I’m saying is if it’s 2 1/2 and Biden won the popular vote by 4 1/2, it’s a seven point swing,
      which is a pretty big swing, don’t you think?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      That’s a big swing. Serious. And again, the uniformity of it is really striking. I mean, just
      whether you’re talking about the most urban counties or the most rural counties, they all kind of
      moved about the same amount, three to four points. As I said, in the Center for Rural Studies
      classification, The New York Times did a thing with a slightly different where they, urban,
      suburban, rural, and they all moved a comparable amount. This was a big statement on the part of the
      country. Interestingly, as we’ll talk about in a minute, people went into this with their eyes wide
      open. I mean, it’s not as if the doubts about Trump have evaporated. They are there very clearly in
      both the Exit Polls and the VoteCast. But as I said in The Atlantic this week, when people are
      unhappy with the status quo, they are willing to risk an unpredictable future rather than voting for
      continuity with an unacceptable present. And we have a lot of precedent for that, as we’ll talk
      about, and I think this really fits into that. I mean, there are questions about the cultural
      positioning of the Democratic Party and what’s happening with different groups in the electorate.
      But the big story is that Americans were deeply disappointed in the outcomes, particularly on the
      economy because of inflation, that they got from Biden, and they voted for change in that context as
      they have always done before. Bill, when you see the level, the approval rating for Biden was only
      around 40%, around 60% disapproved, somewhere between 2/3 and 70% of voters said the economy was in
      bad shape. And in the exit poll, 46% said they were worse off than they were four years ago, only
      about half that said they were better off. There’s just no precedent for the president’s party
      holding the White House amid those kind of attitudes. And there was reason for Democrats to hope
      that they could surmount those attitudes in the states where they could make the case against Trump
      and Trumpism. And in fact, that kind of worked, that did work for them in 2022 when the attitudes
      were similar. But this time it didn’t work. This time when it was not about electing governors or
      senators who were one step removed from those decisions, and it was about electing a president who
      voters I think attribute, give agency on economic policy. That separation didn’t hold. So in some
      ways, and maybe we should talk about this, in some ways, 2022 was a false signal for Democrats that
      they could get more separation in the swing states than in the rest of the country than was actually
      possible in the presidential year itself when voters view the president as just more aligned or
      consequential for national economic policy than they do those other offices.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But so let’s talk maybe about Biden and Harris for a minute and then about Trump and the Republican
      side for a minute, because I think it’s so interesting how much of this was candidate-dependent and
      how much maybe wasn’t and was just incumbency to which party is the incumbent party dependent. And
      the FT had a piece that’s got people out to notice that every incumbent party is basically either
      lost or certainly lost vote share in the last year. And so maybe just pandemic inflation and a world
      in disarray just hurts you and that’s that. But on the [inaudible] side of the pie—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I feel that it’s more incumbent-dependent than it was candidate-dependent. I mean, 2/3 of voters
      said the economy, as I said, was in fair or poor condition, and 70% of them voted for Trump.
      Roughly—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Could they have been persuaded otherwise about the economy, do you think? I mean, there are
      objective indicators that it’s not in such terrible condition.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. Yeah. Let me come back to that in a second, because I just want to give you the other stat. I
      mean, 3/5 of voters, 60% of voters said they disapproved of Biden’s performance, which is mostly the
      economy but also encompasses other things like the border and crime and just kind of general
      malaise. And 80% of them voted for Trump, right? I mean, the 46% of people who said they were worse
      off than four years ago, over 80% of them voted for Trump. 40% said inflation was the most important
      issue and they voted over two to one for Trump. Could they be persuaded otherwise? Well, obviously
      there are a lot of positive economic indicators from the Biden years. Very strong job market, a very
      strong stock market, historic levels of investment in new manufacturing facilities, many of which
      will now come online and you’ll see Trump taking credit for is kind of a striking irony, all of
      this. But I think from what we saw, it was no surprise, because what we saw throughout the Biden
      presidency was that when you ask voters what was the main measure by which they were judging the
      health of the economy, it was inflation. And even though inflation has moderated substantially, that
      big run-up in prices in ’21 and ’22, that roughly 20%-plus increase in groceries, and I think what
      is rent, 30% I think cumulatively under Biden? That I think was insurmountable. I mean, that really
      becomes just, to me, the critical factor in this election. Voters recognize the risks in Trump, but
      they felt that staying the course was riskier because of their discontent with the way things are.
      Now, the issue of whether Trump’s agenda is going to improve any of that is a very different
      question, but historically, when you have a president that’s unpopular and he is running for
      reelection like Carter, H. W. Bush or Trump in 2020, they lose. And they always try the same
      strategy to say, “Let’s not look back. Let’s look forward at the next four years. Whose agenda is
      going to be better for you?” And it’s never worked. I mean, it’s hard for people to conclude that
      you are better for them over the next four years if they don’t think you actually have been better
      for them over the four years you are in office. The part that I think isn’t discussed as much is
      that even if the president chooses to or has to step aside, if you have an unpopular president, we
      just don’t have a precedent for his party holding the White House. When Truman left in ’52,
      Republicans won. When LBJ left in ’68, Republicans won. When W. Bush left in ’08, Democrats won. And
      I think this election very much falls in that lineage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s awfully interesting and important. I mean, one thing that someone could say, “Well,
      maybe Trump could have been…” You’re interpreting it as a normal election and it raises two
      questions which you’ve thought a lot about and written about. One, how did Trump become a normal
      Republican in a sense? How come there wasn’t a special, “Oh my God, we can’t do Trump”? They could
      have imagined that, and that’s in fact what the Democratic strategy was in a sense. Yes, Nikki Haley
      would have won. Let’s just stipulate that. But that doesn’t mean Trump necessarily wins. Or does it?
      I mean, that’s one question. And a flip side of that is Doug Sosnik, our friend who was Clinton’s
      political director, really was struck a year ago when the retrospective evaluation of Trump’s
      presidency, especially on the economy, started to improve. And it ended up pretty high actually.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes. Well, in fact, in the VoteCast—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The fact that he was an ex-president… Go ahead.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      In the VoteCast, Trump’s retrospective job approval was 50%, and Biden was only like, 41, current
      job approval. So—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Tell people what, VoteCast is the…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Is the other. There are two data sources. There are the Exit Polls conducted by Edison Research. And
      then there’s VoteCast by NORC, National Opinion Research Center at University of Chicago, which is
      done for the AP and Fox and others. They’re very similar. There used to be a kind of a rivalry, Coke
      and Pepsi, but the results are astonishingly similar this time. There’s very little daylight between
      them. They tell a very similar story. And yes, we saw that all year, right? We saw that all year.
      Trump’s retrospective job approval was rising. I believed because people were judging him primarily
      through the lens of what they didn’t like about Biden, which was inflation and the border. And all
      of the things that prevented Trump’s approval rating from ever reaching 50 when he was actually
      president, the only president for which that was true through his old term, those were receding in
      voters’ minds. Now, I think if you look at these two data sources, the Exit Polls and the VoteCast,
      they show you that voters, I think, most voters are aware of the risks they are taking with Trump.
      Just let me walk through a few of these numbers. A majority of voters, roughly 55%, said that he was
      too extreme. 55%, again, roughly said that they view him as a threat to democracy. A majority of
      voters in the VoteCast I believe said they had an unfavorable view of him. This is while they’re
      electing him. Still, somewhere around 2/3 of voters said abortion should be legal in all or most
      circumstances. A majority said they oppose mass deportation and believe undocumented should have a
      chance to apply for citizenship. Half of voters said they want the government more, more than half
      said they want the government more involved in providing access to healthcare coverage, health
      insurance. And half said they want the government more involved in ensuring that kids are vaccinated
      for childhood diseases, which is obviously… Now, on all of those fronts, that says to me, it isn’t
      that people didn’t hear the case against Trump or didn’t hear the case against his policies, but
      each one of those groups I mentioned, a substantial and decisive slice of people who express those
      negative views of Trump voted for him anyway. Right? So just to take a couple examples. 1/4 of women
      who describe themselves as pro-choice voted for Trump. 1/4 of Latinos who oppose mass deportation
      voted for Trump. 1/6 of voters, 15, 16% of voters who said that he would take the country in an
      authoritarian direction, voted for Trump. Over one in 10 voters who said that he was too extreme
      voted for Trump. 1/3 of voters who want government to do more in healthcare voted for Trump. Now
      what does that tell you? I mean, I think there’s a very clear and consistent story there, and it is
      one that we have seen before. I remember in 1992 in a campaign that you were involved in, and George
      H. W. Bush was laboring under widespread discontent with all the outcomes in the country,
      particularly in the economy, which also wasn’t that bad at the time in reality. And he stayed close
      in that race by raising doubts about Bill Clinton. Too young, inexperienced, didn’t share American
      values. I remember there being some ad with buzzards on a tree in Arkansas and it was done with kind
      of white light. It was this blasted out post-apocalyptic landscape. But in the end, voters who were
      discontented took the leap of faith on the guy they didn’t know rather than continuing what they did
      know. And I remember writing toward the end of that campaign a story in The L.A. Times, whose lead
      remains one of my guideposts for covering politics, I wrote, “Stability is risk. When people are
      dissatisfied with the way things are going, stability is risk.” I mean, continuing to go in that
      direction is scarier to them than taking the leap into the unknown. And I think Trump clearly
      benefited from that. Yes, he was somewhat normalized, but as you say, 55% say he’s too extreme, 55%
      say he’s taking the country in authoritarian direction. He’s not entirely normalized. It’s just that
      for a really decisive slice of people who held that opinion basically said, “I will take that risk
      because I think he’s going to give me a better economy.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think, well, two things I guess I want to talk about, how much of the Biden problem was also just
      age and sort of things being out of control as opposed to literally the economy. But on Trump, don’t
      you think he was helped a lot by being the ex-president? I mean, somewhat ironically, he seems
      defeated as president. But I think for people who raised the risk argument, and God knows people
      like me tried to a lot and our enterprises I’m involved in tried to, one of the obvious answers,
      “Well, he was president for four years and it was a mixed bag, but it wasn’t terrible. And in fact,
      the economy was good.” And as you said, the retrospective job approval for Trump went up. So he sort
      of had the best of both worlds. You want change? Trump. Change Biden-Harris incumbent. You want
      reassurance? He was president for four years. We’re not talking about a shot in the dark with some
      guy who no one’s ever seen in office. So I don’t know. I feel like that was underrated as an
      advantage of his.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I think you’re absolutely right. Yeah, absolutely. I think you’re absolutely right. I mean, I think
      for that group that I’m talking about, the 1/4 of pro-choice women who voted for him or the 1/6, the
      people who said that he would lead us in authoritarian direction who voted for him, I think they are
      basically saying, “Well, he was president for four years and yeah, there were rough spots, but the
      country survived.” And they didn’t believe that it could necessarily be worse this time on the
      things that they don’t want. I talked to a woman who runs a group that studies basically white
      women. They do tremendous research, data, polling and focus groups. And she said that talking to
      blue collar white women in the fall, they would reject any of the extreme possibilities about Trump
      even when they came from his own mouth, because it was too much cognitive dissonance. They believed
      he was going to give them an economy that was more secure and stable for them, and they just did not
      want to accept that these other things that they did not want him to do might come along, might be
      part of the package. But they are part of the package. I mean, that is the reality. This is a
      package deal. You don’t get to order off different columns in the menu here. If you were voting for
      Trump because you think that somehow he is going to bring prices down, when I think all economists
      agree that his tariffs risk moving prices further up, not to mention if he really goes ahead with
      mass deportation, what that will do to prices. But even if you believe you were going to get lower
      prices, it requires a kind of, was it a suspension of disbelief to basically say that you’re not
      going to get the other parts of it that you don’t want? Because you are going to have RFK out there,
      Junior, undermining vaccines and trying to pressure local governments take fluoride out of the
      water. And you are going to have a justice department that is weapon— I mean, all of these things
      you’re going to get to some degree. I mean, you are going to get significant deportation. I mean,
      presidents do what they run on. And we will see when the vote, there’s kind of interesting equivocal
      judgment where they were like, “I don’t like these things about Trump, but I’m willing to take the
      chance they won’t happen against the relative certainty I have that he’s going to give me a better
      economy.” Well, there’s no guarantee on either side of that ledger. There’s no guarantee he’s going
      to give them a more affordable economy. As I say, many of his policies might move in the opposite
      direction. And there’s even less certainty that he won’t do the things that he said he’s going to
      do. In fact, I think the overwhelming evidence is that he is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, this is very important, I want to come back to this in just a minute. Just to almost finish a
      couple of things on the retrospective, no reason to think Biden would’ve been a better candidate
      than Harris, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      No, worse, I think.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      He’s clearly failing. Worse. Any reason to think if Biden and Harris had agreed that neither was
      going to run and it really would’ve been a little open primary, maybe a longer open primary if they
      had decided that early, and you get Newsom, then Shapiro and everyone running, any reason to believe
      that results fundamentally different? Or you pretty much think you’re the incumbent party, it
      doesn’t matter that much if…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I think it might’ve been a little better, but you’re the incumbent party, it doesn’t matter that
      much. I’m trying to remember from history. She won 17% of people who disapproved of Biden. That
      seems, to me, high. I don’t remember off the top of my head, but I’m guessing that’s relatively high
      by historic standards. Maybe Shapiro or Newsom would’ve gotten that into the low 20s, but you’re
      still dealing with the reality that 60% of people disapprove the outgoing president. Two thirds say
      the economy is in bad shape, nearly half say they are worse off than they were four years ago. And
      whether the incumbent president is running for reelection or stepping aside, there’s just no
      precedent for his party holding the White House amid that collection of attitudes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it didn’t matter that Stevenson
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      It just doesn’t exist.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … wasn’t part of the Truman administration or that John McCain was not a good buddy of
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, Adlai Stevenson. Right, right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      George W. Bush, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Exactly. Exactly. Like I said, you might’ve done a little better with a fresh-faced governor, but I
      don’t think it would’ve been materially different. And look at the Latino thing that we’re going to
      talk a lot about culture, and I’m sure there is elements of the Trumpian macho appeal that worked
      for Latino men. But 55% of Latinos disapprove of Biden’s job performance. 70% of them, even more
      than the country overall, describe the economy as fair or poor. Half of them said they were worse
      off than they were four years ago. Maybe we will look back on this as a lasting realignment of
      Latino voters, but the immediate evidence suggests to me that this was a performance grade of fail.
      Again, Biden had a lot of successes on the economy. For people living paycheck to paycheck,
      inflation just overwhelmed all of that. And I think that’s what we saw. And yeah, somebody
      completely outside the administration might’ve done a little better, but not enough to change. Look,
      maybe the counterfactual is that look at Trump. As we’re saying, people did not entirely normalize
      Trump. They did not. And yet, he basically got what the party out of the White House gets when
      people are discontented. So they were willing to stomach even the Trump risks in their desire to
      cause a change in direction. Given that, I’m not sure that switching to a governor really would’ve
      changed it very much.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Say one word about, more than one word about the… You’ve emphasized so much, and you have the
      numbers, I think at your fingertips at the different groups, white non-college, men and women, white
      college men and women. How did those end up? And any differential movement among them that’s
      interesting from where we were in 2020? Where we’ve been going over the last decades.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      So, as I said, we have these two data sources, the Exit Polls and VoteCast, and they are incredibly
      similar to each other. It’s a little hard for me to square what they are telling us demographically
      with what we saw geographically. Geographically, we saw this uniform swing toward Trump in urban,
      suburban, and rural. In the Exit Polls, there is virtually no change among white voters. Virtually
      no change between ’20 and 2024 among white voters, not only… So basically maybe she is down—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The Exit Polls are very tentative, right? I mean, exit polls have to be adjusted when they start
      matching with—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, also, there are other—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … the voter file and you don’t vote.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      But they have been adjusted.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Problems.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And VoteCast is a bigger… It’s 110,000 sample. Look, we’ll get the Pew validated voters and the
      Catalist analysis later on, and people have a little more faith in those because they’re tied to the
      voter file. But at least what we see from the Exit Polls and VoteCast, and VoteCast, people like
      VoteCast. People are kind of up and down on the Exit Polls, people like VoteCast. But as I said, in
      this case, VoteCast and the Exit Polls are telling us… Let me just give you a couple numbers. I’m
      going to do apples to apples. In the Exit Polls, Trump won white voters in 2020 58/41. He won them
      57/41 in the Exit Polls this time. In the VoteCast, last time, he won white voters 55/43, and he won
      them 55/43 this time. Non-college whites in the Exit Polls went from 67/32 Trump to 66/32 Trump. In
      the VoteCast, there was a little movement. Last time, he was 62% among them, this time 64. But among
      the college whites, better in the Exit Polls than last time, essentially the same in VoteCast. So
      among white voters, it nets out to very little change, essentially no change.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That can’t be right literally, right? Because we know the actual vote moves, let’s just say six and
      a half or 7%. There’s not enough potential movement among Blacks and Hispanics to move—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, I’m saying yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … the actual vote by that number.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, it’s hard to square the story. The vote among non-white voters in both of them did move
      substantially. They both moved around seven points toward Trump.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But that’s seven points of 30%.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, but it’s 14 points in margin.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Oh.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      So 14 points in margin is like what out of 30%? Is like a four and a half point swing.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      4%. So it might account for half the movement, I guess, yeah.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Or more. I don’t know what the final swing will be. It might be, like if it’s five.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      [inaudible].
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Anyway, what the Exit Polls and VoteCast are telling us, and I think the results will tell us, is
      that there was much more movement among voters of color than there were among white voters. I mean,
      Hispanics, the most. A significant decline in both. A more modest but real decline among Black
      voters, especially Black men in both. And the Hispanic men in particular dropped substantially. But
      there was also a drop among Latinas for them, not so much among Black women. Among whites, even in
      all four groups, again, in both the Exit Polls and the VoteCast, not a big change. She didn’t really
      lose ground. She lost a little ground among non-college white men, maybe a little ground among non-
      college white women, gained a little among college white men, may have gained slightly among college
      white women. But A, it nets out to no change. But more importantly, all of those swings weren’t as
      big as they might’ve been. They were kind of muted in both directions, positive for Trump and
      positive for her. And you are left with the biggest change being among Black and Latino men, but
      also Latinas.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And the gender gap doesn’t increase, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Gender gap does not increase. In fact, she wins women by less than not only Biden, but less than
      Hillary in 2016. And he wins men by 13 points in the VoteCast, as hearing in the Exit Polls, and by
      10 points in the VoteCast. That’s more than he did last time, no doubt, but not a blow the doors off
      number, not something that really leaves you surprised. We were looking, there were pre-election
      polling that was like he was going to win men by 15 and she was going to win women by 15. And we did
      not get anywhere near to that kind of gender gap. Again, in this sense, the demographic story and
      the geographic story, I basically point to a common set of experiences and verdicts that transcend a
      lot of boundaries. Bill, more women describe the economy in negative terms than men. So, all right,
      yes, women were pro-choice, but as I said, one quarter of women who said they support legal abortion
      voted for Trump. What can explain that? You’d have to start with the economy as the overwhelming
      factor that explains that, and the fact that women—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And Trump did a little bit to neutralize the issue and—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      He did. He did.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And people, if you live in Wisconsin or Michigan, you don’t think you’re really… Michigan and
      Pennsylvania, certainly, you don’t think you’re really at risk on that because you’ve got Democratic
      governors and some Democratic state legislators and legislatures.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. And in fact—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So it’s not 2022-ish exactly, where you literally—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … are voting on your state’s abortion laws.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And we should go back because we kind of touched on this at the beginning, but I think we both feel
      this way.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      All right.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      So if you look at, what happened in 2022? In 2022, in the states that were not being contested,
      whether they were blue states or red states, Republicans gained. And in those states, the general
      discontent over the economy and Biden basically provided an updraft for Republicans, right? Whether
      it was New York or Texas or Florida, they gained. But Democrats in 2022, in the states that were
      intensely contested, were able to do better because where they spent money, they were able to move
      the focus of enough voters away from their general unhappiness over the economy or Biden toward
      abortion, democracy, extremism of Trump candidates. And thus, even in a national environment where
      Republicans won the national House popular vote by three points, I think it was, Democrats won the
      governorships in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Senate seat in Georgia, et cetera. That
      was the model that seemed possible in 2024, and which I certainly thought was possible for them in
      2024. So the analogy would be yes, Harris’ lead in the national popular vote would decline
      substantially from Biden’s because generalized discontent over Biden and the economy, which was
      undiminished from ’22, would allow Republicans to gain in the places that neither party was
      seriously contesting. But a la 2022, Democrats thought that in the swing states, they could
      surmount, they could overcome that headwind of generalized discontent by focusing voters on Trump’s
      deficiencies, abortion, democracy, et cetera. They could have a separate election in the swing
      states than in the non-competitive states, blue and red. And it wasn’t a crazy theory because it’s
      exactly what happened in 2022. It did not happen in 2024. To an extent, it did. Democrats did not—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But it happened a little, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Right, to an extent, it did.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The swing was less in the swing states. So go ahead.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Right, the swing was less in the swing states, but it was not as big a gap as 2022, when Democrats
      won them, in many cases, comfortably. The share of voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania
      in 2022 who said the economy was in poor shape was as high as it was everywhere else. And yet,
      Democrats won those governorships pretty easily in all three cases. So there was a widespread
      belief, which did not seem to me crazy going in, that you could sort of immunize or you could put a
      dome, a Stephen King kind of dome around the swing states with your campaign, your advertising, your
      door knocking, your appearances, and you could get voters in them to make their decisions on
      different issues than in the states that weren’t being contested and where they weren’t getting this
      messaging. And as you said, it happened somewhat, but not nearly enough. And the swing states also
      moved. And basically, it says to me now, in retrospect, that electing a governor or senator is one
      thing. When you’re electing a president, you’re electing the person who you think is actually
      responsible, rightly or wrongly, for those economic conditions. So achieving separation from or
      achieving escape velocity from the gravity of unhappiness over the economy is just harder in a
      presidential year and turned out to be impossible in the presidential year. Is it an extent? Yes.
      The swing in the swing states wasn’t as big as it was in the non-competitive states, but it wasn’t
      nearly as good as 2022.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And I got that wrong in the sense that I thought, and I think you and I talked about this and
      sort of agreed on this, that Trump’s paid advertising seemed powerful, very aggressive, not answered
      by the Harris campaign. Maybe reasonably not answered, but leave that aside for a sec or come back
      to that if you want. But then as the actual campaigning by Harris and the earned media, so to speak,
      the convention speech, the debate were all good for her. But in fact, since Harris did better in the
      states with the hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising and worse in the, let’s call it the
      more natural places, where they saw the convention and the debate, but they didn’t see all the
      advertising, I think I, A, was just wrong about maybe the paid advertising, or at least B, as you
      say, that the margin got reduced in the swing states where there was all this campaigning and
      advertising. But the swing was three or four points instead of five or six, maybe, or seven, or
      bigger in some states where it didn’t seem competitive in the Virginias and New Jersey’s of the
      world, where there was real movement.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Anyway, I don’t know which… I don’t know. I mean— talk about that going, if you want, more on sort
      of the details, but also, I’m very curious what you think, which is the indicator of where we’re
      going? If I can put it that way. Is the movement in the swing states sort of the real number,
      because that’s where it was really contested? Or in a weird way, could you argue that the New
      Jerseys of the world, where there wasn’t that much contestation and the voters kind of just voted
      what they naturally thought and wished is, in a way, a better example, that you’re not going to be
      able to sort of drag voters back a little bit the way the massive door knocking in those swing
      states did? Which is the future, which is the better, I don’t know this is the way to say this
      exactly, and maybe there’s no answer to it, but—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Predictor of the future?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … which is more likely the kind of leading indicator here, I guess?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, I think rather than the leading indicator, I take it as performance basically will influence
      both. In the same way that even the most spirited campaign couldn’t overcome a negative verdict on
      Biden’s performance, if Trump is a success, Republicans will be in a very strong position in 2028.
      If, in fact, he goes ahead with massive tariffs and mass deportation that cause inflation to spike
      again, to start going back up, and if he pursues a series of these policies that people continue to
      express reservations about, but kind of hope wouldn’t happen or told themselves, la la, la, la, la
      wouldn’t happen. I think the cultural gains among Latino men are probably real. But I think that the
      fact that the decline was so uniform, says to me that it was bigger than anything targeted at any
      one group. It was essentially a shared national verdict on the past four years. And I think if
      that’s the cause, if that’s the driving factor, then the shared national verdict on the next four
      years is going to be the most important factor in 2028.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s really helpful and I think important because, and the way one person put it to me
      yesterday is it’s easier to be an authoritarian demagogue out of power because you take advantage of
      everything people don’t like. And in Trump’s case, some of the negative side of being as
      authoritarian or as demagogic, was muted by the fact that he was an ex-president and maybe muted by
      other things as well, or by wishful thinking or by the rest of the party saying he was fine and
      therefore, reassuring people and so forth. But you do have to then govern, and a lot of
      authoritarians have had a rough time governing, and then at the ballot box, assuming they let there
      be another ballot box selection. Orban is the one that the American Trump types are so interested in
      because he’s actually been sort of successful at pulling it off in a way, in a way that Bolsonaro
      and so many others haven’t been, right? They turned out it was very hard for them to… They paid a
      price the way they… They exerted a price when they defeated their predecessor and then they paid a
      price. So I guess, A, that’s just worth talking about a bit. Do you have a sense of which policies
      matter the most in terms of Trump’s success or not? And I guess how much has he invested in these
      things as opposed to the moment the stock market has a hiccup because of tariffs or even
      deportation? Trump thinks, “I can’t do that. I know what side of…” What’s the metaphor I’m looking
      for, what side my bread is buttered on here? Stephen Miller can want to deport all the people he
      wants, but I do not want a drop in the Dow by 10%. I don’t know. What do you think? You’ve watched
      Trump closely, where is he in this?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I think overwhelmingly, Trump, there’s obviously somewhere in the mid-40s, low-40s of the electorate
      who wants him to do all of the most extreme things he’s talking about. But the voters who elected
      him mostly want him to provide an economy that gives them more stability and breathing room, some
      combination of moderated prices and growing wages that allows people to feel that their head is
      above water even if they’re not getting ahead. Again, 46% saying they’re worse off. I think a lot of
      the things that he ran on face significant resistance in the electorate. Certainly anything that
      will restrict abortion on a national level, aside a ban, restricting access to abortion medication.
      Mass deportation in the exit poll had majority opposition, and that’s before the first pictures of a
      mother and daughter being herded onto a bus, a van, or much less in one of Stephen Miller’s kind of
      fever dream internment camps that he wants to build. Don’t forget, the Sunday before the election on
      60 Minutes , while most of the attention was focused on the island of garbage joke, one of Trump’s
      top immigration advisors went on 60 Minutes and was asked how they would avoid family separation,
      which was deeply unpopular, as you recall, during mass deportation, since there are 4 million US
      citizen kids, Latino kids with at least one undocumented parent. And he said, “We’re going to avoid
      family separation by deporting the kids too, deporting the citizen kids too.” If they really start
      doing that, how’s that going to be received? There are a lot of landmines. Certainly, there is room
      for him … anything that goes toward reducing people’s cost of living, he has I think a lot of
      leeway. So, if he can portray rolling back the climate agenda and drilling more as a way to lower
      your energy costs, again, you’ll get that slice that we saw, even a share of the voters who are
      concerned about climate change will probably say, “Okay, we have to make this choice now.” But when
      you start getting away from that, away from this central nexus of prices and affordability and my
      cost of living, I think there’s a lot more risk for him on those fronts. Again, people were aware of
      … and it’s not like the concerns about Trump have evaporated. They just sublimated them to their
      more immediate concerns about their economic situation. And I think he risks, depending on how far
      he goes in the directions that he’s talked about, if he convenes a military tribunal to try Liz
      Cheney for treason or General Milley, that I don’t think is going to be received very well. But
      again, economic success will buy him a lot of leeway. If there is not, I think the biggest risk to
      him is that his agenda does not solve the problem he was elected to solve and in fact makes it
      worse, which is what most economists believe.

      I was having an argument with a Democrat who, “Well, he’s campaigned on getting prices back down and
      that would require deflation or depression.” I don’t think that’s true.

    text: |
      Yeah, a depression.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      He gets a, sort of like with stocks, you get a, what’s that called when you mark them up to the new

    text: |
      Yeah, mark to market.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, mark to market, like when people die and stuff they say marks to… I think people accept that
      prices are where they are. And I do think the moment he sees, though, if he sees the tariff stuff
      leading to inflationary pressures … I don’t know how much he believes in tariffs and how much he
      just wants to threaten people with it or use it to reward friends. Threaten others from foreign
      governments—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, no, and that’s a big—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … or fake declare victory the way he did with China in 2018, but not actually endanger huge swaths
      of the economy. And a lot will depend, I suppose, on who’s around him. And I’ve been sort of on this
      side of, well, you’ve got JD Vance and Tucker Carlson and people like that. You’re dealing with
      pretty committed ideologues who believe in all this stuff—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      RFK Jr., yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … America First and all this. On the other hand, that’s not what Trump is exactly, and it’s not what
      Susie Wiles, his incoming Chief of Staff is going to be like, I don’t think. And so, I guess that’s
      one thing to really follow, right? And I guess will there an early indicator of where you fall? I
      guess it could be issue by issue, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, presidents have enormous unilateral authority over tariffs and immigration. Doesn’t really
      need Congress to give him the authority to do these things. So he can do them on day one, and they
      have said they’re going to start deportations on day one. The tariffs I think will be a big telling
      point. What did he say? 10% across the board, 60% or more on China. I think the Chinese one, I’m not
      an expert in trade law, but I think the Chinese ones might require more of a process, but he can do
      the tariffs pretty fast, so we’ll see if he wants to. The tax cuts, they will have to extend those
      sometime in 2025. If they win the House, which they’re probably going to do, I suppose California
      could allow Democrats to eke it out, more likely not. They will extend the tax cuts, they will end
      the enhanced ACA subsidies. So a lot of people are going to be moving off of the exchanges. We’re
      going to have millions of fewer people with health insurance. But again, one-third of the people who
      said they want the government to do more to expand access to healthcare voted for Trump. The primacy
      of the sense that in his presidency there was more economic security, I had more money in my pocket
      at the end of the week, that phrase you kept hearing, Democrats that was, I described as the
      nightmare phrase they kept hearing in focus groups of Latino and Black men throughout the Biden
      presidency, “Yes, Trump’s a racist. Yes, he disrespects women. Yes, I worry that he would threaten
      American democracy. But if I’m being honest, I had more money in my pocket at the end of the week
      when he was president.” How many times I have heard that from political consultants in both parties,
      that they heard that in focus groups of non-white men. And that proved true all the way through
      election day.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think you mentioned the ACA thing, the Obamacare subsidy. That’ll be kind of an interesting test.
      So there’s going to be a tax bill, there has to be, [inaudible]. Traditionally, presidents, that’s
      the one issue I would say a new president who takes over from the other party almost always gets his
      way—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes, absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … on one or two very big pieces of legislation, and they’re almost always taxes because that’s kind
      of an obvious one to do, and also you could do it through reconciliation and so forth. So that would
      be Reagan ’81, and it would be Bush in 2001, pretty … even Obama.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And Trump, 2017, Obama, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, and then Trump in 2017. So I guess Biden won on the spending side, but to get the big victory,
      less tax change.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, ultimately but it took a while.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I wonder how much Trump privately … He’s going to get the tax cuts he wants. He’s going to make his
      supporters very happy. He’s going to make Wall Street happy, presumably, might make some middle
      class people happy. I wonder if he just throws the ACA stuff off the, forgets about it. I mean, it’s
      not as if there’s no possibility of a few Republicans, especially in the House where their margin
      will be pretty small … but even in the Senate, I don’t know, does Dave McCormick really want to vote
      for that? Maybe in Pennsylvania, maybe he just decides, you know what, why can’t we just have a
      compromise on that one issue? I mean, that would be interesting test in a way of where Trump is in
      terms of some of these more ideological promises, I think.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, I think it is. I mean, first of all, on the ACA subsidies, they expire at the end of
      2025. I think Republicans are just going to let them go away. I mean, I can’t see them extending
      those enhanced subsidies, which have dramatically increased the number of people. I think there were
      11 and a half million people on the exchanges when Trump left office. It’s 21 million now. That’s 10
      million more people covered. And that’s because of the enhanced subsidies. And he will, I think,
      certainly let them expire. The bigger question is do they go after the ACA again in the way they did
      in 2017, trying to unravel the risk sharing? And even more important than that, do they block grant
      Medicaid and cut it? I mean, that’s been a goal of Republicans since the ’90s. It was at the center
      of the government shutdowns under Clinton. And House Republican, would a 220-seat, 221-seat House
      Republican majority block grant Medicaid? Probably, and are there four Republican senators who would
      vote against it if McCormick ends up winning, which seems like he will? We know Murkowski and
      Collins wouldn’t block grant Medicaid. Maybe Tillis. Maybe McCormick. I don’t know. I mean, I think
      the pressure… I could see, if they get to 53 senators, a very serious threat of substantial cuts in
      Medicaid and block granting of Medicaid and literally millions, probably 10 million or more people
      without insurance at the end of the Trump presidency than today.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I’ve been a skeptic that, I mean, given that Trump is winning with this big swing and is going
      to bring in Republican senators and he’s mostly running ahead of, so they will feel like they’re
      indebted to him. I don’t know if he’s running ahead or Harris is running behind the Democrats, but
      either, same thing, same effect in his way, I suppose. And let’s assume it’s 221, 222 I think in the
      House. So a very slight margin, and maybe they’ll pick up a seat from where they are now. He has
      huge clout. I mean, I do think that’s a very important general point to make. People who have a
      static view of Trump here on Friday, November 8th, which is a view that’s mostly shaped by the
      campaign, of course, and by the last few months, don’t appreciate what it’s going to feel like by
      January 20th, I would say, when if he has a pretty successful transition, that’s another big if, and
      I think Democrats should think about how to make it less successful honestly. But if he has a less
      chaotic transition than 2016-17, if he has some reassuring appointments that balances the kind of JD
      Vance, Steve Miller side of the party with, let’s call it, The Wall Street establishment side in
      terms of his own cabinet and so forth, he goes in with huge momentum and clout and one forgets how
      powerful. Reagan didn’t have the House obviously in 1981 and still was able to. Obama had big
      margins, but he also tried to pass some pretty unpopular stuff. And he did ultimately kind of close
      call and so forth. Anyway, so on the one hand I think he has a huge amount of clout. On the other
      hand, we still do have independently elected senators and members of Congress for all that they
      don’t exercise their independence much. And maybe there’s political pressure on them on whether it’s
      on deportations or on tax policy or on fights about salt. I mean, I don’t know. One can imagine. Do
      you think, I guess I’ll put it this way, how much will American politics look like normal politics
      in this middle of 2025 when the kinds of fights we were all familiar with, with wings for the party,
      rebelling at things sort of, and not every person sailing through with automatic confirmation?
      Usually one or two people go down even when your party controls the Senate. You have to pull a
      nominee who has a problem. How much is it that and how much is it, it’s a new world and it’s sort of
      Trump triumphant?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein

      Well, I think we are generally moving toward a more parliamentary system where the Congress does not
      break from the president of their party very much. Obviously, Manchin and Sinema were a big point of
      resistance for Biden. But if you look at the House, I mean, they had a tiny majority and they
      passed, when the Democrats controlled the House, they passed everything on the Democratic list. I
      mean, assault weapon ban, voting rights, LGBTQ rights, police reform, Build Back Better. I think
      you’re going to see something like that in the House. I mean, I think you will see very high levels
      of support. Now, can they repeal the IRA subsidies, the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, when the
      vast majority of that investment is going into Republican-held districts? That might be a bridge too
      far, but I think they will be able to pass a lot. There isn’t that much that they want to pass,
      though. I mean, it’s like often for Republicans, cutting taxes and confirming judges are the main
      things they want out of Congress. Again, maybe block granting Medicaid, which would be a big except.
      That’s something Republicans have been trying to do for 30 years. But as I said, I think the most
      important things that he ran on, he can do himself. Deportation and tariffs, and maybe more domestic
      oil drilling. I mean, what else is there in his domestic agenda that… Yeah, he said that he wants to
      require every police department in the country to do stop-and-frisk as a condition of getting law
      enforcement aid. Maybe they will try that. Mike Johnson co-sponsored a national don’t say gay bill.
      Maybe they will try that. More likely, Republicans don’t really generally put a lot of premium on
      passing sweeping new… They might try to pass a national voter ID law. After Democrats fail to pass
      legislation expanding voting rights on a national basis, they might try to pass legislation imposing
      some of the red state restrictions. But unless you’re going to end the filibuster, they’re not going
      to be able to do that either. So if I had to guess, the legislative activity centers on what they
      can do in the tax/reconciliation bill and confirming judges and maybe justices, if they can convince
      Alito or Thomas to step down before ’26, which I wouldn’t be surprised if they can. And then the
      biggest changes from Trump will be administrative, deportation, tariffs, drilling, and on the other
      side of the ledger, a lot of his various threats towards civil liberties and civil rights.

      Civil service reforms.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      They’re going to be intervening. Yeah, civil service reform. They’re going to be intervening in
      cases against racial equity or diversity, against private sector companies that are doing DEI.
      They’ll probably use the Securities Exchange Commission to go after that. He said he wants RFK Jr.
      to go wild on the healthcare system, and wild can get pretty wild with RFK Jr. One thing on that,
      interesting, he said the day before we’re talking that he doesn’t want to revoke the legal status of
      any vaccines, but he wants parents to be more educated about the risks. CDC reported last year that,
      I’m not a public health specialist, but CDC says that once you get to 5% noncompliance with public
      school vaccination mandates, you start running the risk of outbreaks. We’re at 3 now for many of the
      major childhood diseases, 3% noncompliance. If Donald Trump gives RFK Jr. a platform to make the
      case against vaccines, what are the odds that some more parents, really both ends of the [inaudible]
      spectrum, but especially the conservative say, “Well, hey, the president says we shouldn’t be doing
      this.” And you start moving into the danger zone where the 93, 94, 92% of parents who want kids
      vaccinated in public schools suddenly are faced with a situation where their kid is now subject to
      an increased risk of outbreak because of the influence RFK Jr. had on the parents down the block.
      Again, that’s what I was talking about. Performance is going to matter a lot. If vaccination
      compliance goes down and we get a few outbreaks, a few measles outbreaks, what will that mean in the
      2026 election? I mean, it’ll mean something. Again, people sublimated all of those concerns to the
      idea that Trump could produce an economy that would be more stable for them, give them more
      security, but doesn’t mean they’re necessarily on board with undermining vaccine compliance. And
      again, what actually happens is going to matter an awful lot.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I think that’s true in other areas too. How much is the justice department weaponized? How
      much is there an intervention in military promotions? How much publicity does it get? There’s a
      scenario where this is where Orban, I’d say you operate sort of beneath the radar in a lot of these
      areas. Now, Hungary is not the US, and so you can do a lot of damage by taking over universities and
      media in a way, a little harder to do. You could intimidate people, you could pay off your friends.
      You could do a lot of things that you and I would not like, I would say, as a matter of good public
      policy or good governance, but would kind of stay beneath the radar of causing a rebellion among
      people who voted for you. And then there are things that, and you start to predict actually, what
      goes over the line. Right? It could be one symbolic thing almost that goes over the line more than
      the actual
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Like the family separation. Family separation—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. So, it’s an interesting—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      … in the first term. By the way, family separation was 5,000 kids. Okay?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, right, so…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      It was a tragedy, it was 5,000. Huge backlash. As I said, there are four million U.S. citizen
      children with at least one undocumented parent among Latinos, and I think there’s about another
      million, Bill, of other nationalities of kids who are citizens and have at least one undocumented
      parent. How many cases of either separating the kids from the parents, making the kids into orphans
      by deporting their parents, or attempting to also deport the U.S. citizen kids, which theoretically
      would face, obviously, face legal questions. I don’t know. Is John Roberts going to stop Donald
      Trump from doing that if it comes to that? Is John Roberts going to stop Donald Trump from doing
      anything, if it comes to that?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And I’d say, just to add to that, then I want to switch to Democrats as we close, on foreign
      policy, I think it’s a very similar thing. You could do, in my opinion, a lot of damage, make the
      world less stable, help our allies less, help bad guys more—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … without having an obvious though, quite tipping point. Or, you could have, we pull away from
      Ukraine. It starts to become… They start losing territory, and maybe more and more, and suddenly
      there’s kind of genocide almost in these territories.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What does that look like to American voters? I know they don’t care about foreign policy and blah,
      blah, blah. But still, at some point people look up and say, ” Wait a second, this is not what… We
      were sort of promised an end to the conflict, not an acceleration of Putin’s kind of barbarous
      actions.” And to say nothing of China, Taiwan and so forth. So I mean, or Iran. And I feel like
      there’s a lot of places where, yes, it’s of course hard to predict. Talk about the Democrats for a
      minute. I mean, what do they do? How much? Once they get through all the recriminations, and
      complaints, and excessively complicated analyses? Is there rethinking? Is there generational shift?
      Is it just kind of, “Well, we’re not going to be the incumbent, so we can just be against Trump and
      probably be okay”? What do you think?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, I think in terms of 2028, it will be both a generational and geographic shift. Think a la Bill
      Clinton in ’92, there will be a lot of interest in a younger governor. I think that kind of
      transcends whatever messaging is done, but move it out of Washington, and be a generational shift.
      Harris, I thought, was a pretty good candidate. The situation she inherited, obviously, that one
      very bad moment on The View , couldn’t think of anything she’d do different from Biden. But overall,
      she hit her marks on all of the big moments, and certainly generated a lot of excitement and
      enthusiasm. What she really couldn’t do was reassure enough working class voters, in particular,
      that she had an economic alternative that would make their life better. Again, based on history, I’m
      not sure that… The history is replete with presidents or their would-be successors trying to get
      voters to look forward when they’re discontented over the previous four years. It just has not
      worked, ever. So, look, I think a part of the… The obvious message that Democrats will take away
      from this is, “We have to do better among working class voters across racial lines.” Now, some will
      say, “Well, that will require a cultural moving to the middle. Maybe, maybe not. I’m not sure how
      important that was. In the end, it is going to require convincing them that Democrats have a plan
      that can make their life better in material ways.” And, if Trump is not successful economically,
      obviously, that gets a lot easier. I’m not sure the ferocity of resistance to him will be as intense
      as it was in 2017, given that he is certainly going to win the popular vote and may win a majority.
      I’m not sure. Democrats may pick their spots, as opposed to… Is there going to be a Women’s March in
      January of 2025? Probably not. Again, he did better among women than he did in 2016. And even a lot
      of pro-choice women voted for him. A quarter of pro-choice women voted for him. So, I think for
      Democrats, the search for an economic message that resonates with blue collar folks across racial
      lines is going to be front and center. Again, it’s not entirely clear what that would be. I mean,
      Biden did execute and achieve a significant recalibration of the Democratic economic message. I
      mean, he basically said, “I am going to put my chips on spending massively to encourage the revival
      of American manufacturing, and the creation of jobs that don’t require a college degree.” He talked
      about that all the time, and she did too. How many jobs they were creating that did not require a
      college degree. And they have, in fact, generated an investment boom, and in clean energy primarily,
      but also semiconductors. And it didn’t matter. I mean, the number of people who benefit from that,
      even at the most expansive version of it, is still pretty limited. It’s hundreds of thousands of
      people. I think they said they added 800,000 manufacturing jobs, whereas tens of millions are
      affected by inflation. So, I don’t know what a different… I mean, Biden already moved the economic
      message to be less focused on the Clinton, Obama idea of, “You earn what you learn. We’re going to
      get more people into higher education.” He didn’t really talk about that very much. Clinton and
      Obama were like, “We’re going to train people for the jobs of the future.” And Biden was like, “No,
      we’re going to create jobs that will allow you to lead a good life without a college degree.” And
      that didn’t work, even though he kind of did it. I mean he did do it, right? I mean, look at that
      Intel plant going up in Ohio, or everything that’s going up in Georgia, or in Michigan in the clean
      energy space. And it didn’t really matter that much. And again, I think inflation was the biggest
      part of that. But the one thing I think you can feel pretty confident about is there will be a
      generational and geographic change. Hard to imagine a senator being the nominee in 2028. Hard to
      imagine it won’t be someone who’s younger. Shapiro, Whitmer, Newsom, people like that. Beshear. I
      think they’re all going to get a lot of discussion. Probably won’t be a woman. I mean, might be
      Whitmer, because she is got the other thing of Heartland authenticity. But, the fact that you’ve had
      two elections in a row where there were a substantial core of white women who appeared… Non-college
      white women who appeared reluctant to vote for a woman as president, tended to fall back into the
      belief that they’re more likely to be kept safe by a man. That’s something. That’s out there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And presumably Trump, assuming he does respect the Constitution enough not to run again, or he is
      just old enough that he won’t do it. I mean, I guess, there’s also a bit of… It’s not so obvious
      that, well, so much depends on how the Administration goes I guess at that point.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, by the way, we never talked about that. Trump showed clear signs on the campaign of cognitive
      decline, right? Without a question. I mean, just the debate. I mean, he couldn’t complete a thought.
      In many of his rallies. He just came up with the weave to explain why he could not complete a
      thought. You could argue that he’s 78 now, right? Isn’t that what Biden was when he went into 2020?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it’s almost tiny bit older than Biden was when he won.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And I would argue to you that he looks to have more challenges than Biden did when he started. So,
      not inconceivable to me in a year, or 18 months, a lot of voters look at Trump and have the same
      questions they did about Biden. Is he capable of doing this? Not saying that will happen, but if
      that does happen, it certainly seems possible, what is the effect of that over an extended period of
      time on the GOP’s position heading into 2024? If, in fact, that deterioration, which I think was
      evident at… Clearly evident at points during the campaign continues, that was a problem. I mean,
      Biden’s age became a symbol of weakness, and out of touch, and feeble. People don’t see Trump as
      feeble, but there are already concerns in the electorate about whether he’s too old to do the job,
      and he’s just starting.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, I think it’s so many… It is amazing how many… for all that this was a big election, which
      I think has real consequences and implications, as you say, the national swing, as we all said, on
      the other hand, there’s so many imponderables, and you sort of don’t know. I mean, it’s entirely
      possible. It’s a slightly bizarre one-off, and it’s entirely possible we’re at the beginning of a
      new era in American politics, or maybe we’re at the beginning of a new era, but it’s not the era we
      think it is, two days after the election of 2024. Right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I feel like I just go back to… The uniformity of this says to me that it’s performance-based above
      all, rather than any particular message targeted in any particular group. And, I think the legacy
      Trump leaves behind, if in fact he steps aside, and we shouldn’t even be laughing about that. The
      legacy Trump leaves behind will be shaped by his performance.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, that’s such a—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      If people think he does not deliver on the better life that he promised, and/or that he has
      disrupted American society too much… I mean, he’s talked on multiple occasions on multiple different
      reasons about sending the military into U.S. cities.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I think people discounted that, because again, that analysis, they want to believe he is going to
      give them a more stable economic situation. And therefore, they kind of push out of their mind
      anything that would cause them to hesitate about voting for that more stable economic situation,
      because that’s what they really want to do. So I don’t… “La la la la la. I don’t want to hear that
      he’s going to send the military into Chicago, or that he’s going to round up political opponents, or
      he’s going to separate kids from their parents in industrial scale. I don’t want to hear that,
      because I want to get the benefit that I am expecting from him of a more stable economy, more
      economic security.” Let’s see what the four years produce, and I think then we will have a better
      idea of what his political legacy will be.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I mean a slight counter-argument to what you were just saying though is that, people might not
      mind if the military goes to Chicago if the economy’s good, right? I mean, how much tolerance they
      have for some of these things that you and I might not like is a very open question. But, I also
      agree that because they voted once or twice for me, it doesn’t mean that they have infinite
      tolerance for all that stuff. So, somewhere in the spectrum, we will learn, I guess he will learn.
      We tested to see how flexible he is. Reagan. We all think Reagan revolution. He went through with
      the tax cuts, and defense buildup, and was very adamant on those. He gave way on a lot of things,
      right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      TEFRA. TEFRA!
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Reagan did not do a lot that he promised to do in 1980.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      He raised taxes. He raised taxes in 1983.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, but also, he… big social security—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean all this conservative critique of social security. Having to make a deal with Tip O’Neill—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      [inaudible] commission, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Of course, he talked more of a game. Sandra Day O’Connor. I mean, the degree to which presidents
      have to pick what they want to be adamant on and what they don’t is… That’d be very interesting to
      see with Trump, I think.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, yeah, a lot to follow in the next four years. But kind of amazing—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, well, you know where to find us.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. But also just to finish up, I mean kind of an unexpected and somewhat startling result, I’ve
      got to say, don’t you think?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, the magnitude of it was startling. And again, I think the core… I think everyone
      expected that, in states that weren’t being fought, Trump would improve, whether they were blue
      states or red states. Because you can’t have 75% wrong track, 60% disapproval of the president, and
      not have an erosion of his party’s position. But, the idea that you could hive off, or put the swing
      states under a dome, and in those states, you could counteract the underlying trend by spending
      money to focus people on what they didn’t like about Trump and the Republican Party. That worked in
      2022. It worked to a slight extent in 2024, but not nearly to the extent they needed. And
      essentially, we saw a nationwide uniform verdict, that voters were dissatisfied with what they got
      over the past four years, and whatever doubts they had about the alternative, that seemed to them
      less risky than continuing on the course that we are on. And, as we have seen in elections like
      Carter, H.W. Bush, replacement of Truman, replacement of LBJ, replacement of Bush, stability is risk
      to most voters, and that’s what we had.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And we’ll see where we are in two years and four years, and maybe even one year with Virginia and
      New Jersey. So, we will come back and have more of these conversations. But this has been awfully
      illuminating, Ron. Really helpful, and thanks for taking time to do this.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, thanks to having me, Bill. Always great to be with you. I mean, we’ve seen enough of these to
      know that there is no last word, ever, in American politics. And, I guess my main thing that I’m
      coming away from this is that performance really matters. I mean, it’s not just ideology. It’s not
      just the shifting allegiances of different groups or places. Everybody wants you to deliver. And if
      you don’t, you pay a price everywhere. And that’s exactly what we saw.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Fair enough. Of course, they have to judge what delivering means and so forth. But yes.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes. That’s—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      They certainly made that judgment over three, four years with Biden. It never changed really. Right?
      From the summer, late summer of 2021. That is pretty striking. That number was flat [inaudible]
      approval.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Before you go, I mean, you remember the… I mean, the 1980 campaign had a lot of overlap with this,
      where there was the verdict on Carter. That never changed for years. But for months and months in
      the election year, he was able to stay close by pointing the finger and saying, “Do you really trust
      this guy to be president? He’s washed up, actor. Warmonger. Didn’t know enough about the national
      government.” And in the end, voters decided that they were more… that continuing with Carter was a
      bigger risk than taking the leap to Reagan. And I think that’s what we saw again this time.
