      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations. I’m very pleased to be joined today, I think
      for the third time, by my friend Ray Takeyh of the Council of Foreign Relations, Senior Fellow
      there. Former government official for a year or two, I guess. But most importantly, really, a
      leading—maybe a leading analyst, I’m not going to rank you with your competitors— of Iran, Iran-
      American relations. And we had a couple of wonderful conversations in 2022 and 2023, at the height
      of the protests and what might happen internally, that you were… I think those stand up well in the
      sense that you were both hopeful as a human, but worried about the ability of the regime to hang on.
      And they did. But maybe this is different. I don’t know. Anyway, thanks, Ray, for joining me today.

      And since things are so fluid and moving so fast in the region, it’s 10:00 AM, Wednesday, June 18th.
      And that’s when this conversation is taking place, and just so people know. So, Ray, thanks again
      for joining me. And I thought I really want to get your thoughts on everything, but especially on
      Iran, because I feel like here in the US, people have opinions about the US administration. Israel’s
      pretty well covered. There’s a ton of Americans who know a lot about Israel and stuff. Of the three
      parts, Iran is the blackest box. And so, you have real insight there. You keep up so well with
      what’s happening there. Obviously, read the media and the websites and so forth, talk to people. So,
      here we are. Israel’s had a pretty impressive assault on Iran. Maybe a little unexpected and we’re a
      few days in. What do you think is the actual situation, both in terms of the nuclear programs,
      obviously in the general and military might of Iran, but also the political situation?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, to start with the nuclear program, as far as one knows, because there hasn’t been that many
      after action reports. Of the main nuclear installation that Iran had at Natanz, that has at least at
      upper levels been destroyed. It is estimated, I think by the IAEA, that out of some 18,000 machines,
      centrifuge cascades that were installed there, 14,000 have been disabled. Now, that has something to
      do with the Israeli strike. But what the Israelis did is knock out the power, electricity grid for
      Natanz. And what happens with these centrifuges that are spinning at high velocity when the power
      shuts down unexpectedly, then you have see a lot of breakage. So, Israelis I think probably in their
      strike destroyed about 1,700, but the breakage. And for some reason, Iran did not have a backup
      generator of significance in Natanz. Maybe Israelis disable that. Fordow is obviously something
      everybody’s talking about. It’s a deeply underground bunker sort of a facility that is inaccessible
      to Israeli munitions, as far as we know. That seems to be intact. Although, the Israelis, as I
      understand it, have not just knock off the electric grid, but they do have backup generators there.
      But also, the two entrances that Fordow has had. So, that kind of has sealed it, at least for now.
      One of the significant things that the Israelis have done is attack the Isfahan plant, which is a
      multipurpose plant. And one of the subsections of that particular installation was uranium
      conversion, where you take essentially uranium and convert it to uranium plates. That can be used
      for nuclear civilian purposes, but also it is an indispensable step for nuclear weaponization. I
      don’t know if the Iranians have another conversion facility, but that essentially injects more
      delays into that. The Israeli operation is ongoing. And there are aspects of the Iranian program
      that we don’t know about. Director General Grossi of the IAEA has suggested that for the past four
      years he has no accounting of where Iran is building its centrifuges. There are a couple of known
      centrifuge construction plans. I believe there are two of them. I think the Israelis bombed one
      yesterday. But if there are small workshops here and there, we just don’t know. At least IAEA
      doesn’t know. That doesn’t mean the Israelis don’t know. David Albright of the International Science
      Institute estimates the Iranian nuclear program’s probably been set back for at least one year. But
      these are ongoing assessments and there will be some time before we sort all this out. And also
      depends what happens in Fordow and what happens thereafter. In terms of the politics of the country,
      honestly, I think everybody is now—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, that’s so interesting about the nuclear program. So, basically a year, which is I think more
      than people might’ve expected earlier. And of course, with Fordow, it’s the huge question mark—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Correct. Well, there are—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … and other question marks, too, I guess.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      One of the Israeli plans for dealing with Fordow was a commando raid, but that was leaked into The
      New York Times. So, you have to have five — 1,000 troops to put in there and it’ll takes a while.
      Now, Israelis do have air dominance, but that’s like… I don’t know if any defense planner at this
      point would recommend that, to essentially put 1,000 commandos. And that will take time. They have
      to go through the blast doors, and so on and so forth. It’s not a one-day operation. So, that was
      one of the options that Israelis have considered. But I’m not sure if they’re considering it today,
      because essentially, they’re petitioning the United States to use this aircraft and munitions, which
      they don’t have access to.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And just on the military side, generally, I guess before we get to the politics-politics, it does
      feel like there’s some pretty broad, and much broader maybe than people expected, devastation of the
      Iranian security forces, both externally oriented ones— and maybe internally oriented ones?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      I think The New York Times estimated that about 11 Iranian generals have already been killed. All
      the relevant commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, of the regular military, and the entire Quds
      Force. The building has essentially collapsed. So, how many people have died of that? Who knows. The
      top leadership has been so decapitated, but although it is capable of regenerating. They have
      appointed a number of substitutes, number of replacements. One of them was already killed. I think
      they’re increasingly making announcement of two substitutes for every job, in case one guy is
      killed. So, this has been quite devastating to that military leadership. Again, it’s a multi-layered
      force, so it is capable of regenerating leadership, whether it’s going to be of the same caliber, or
      less so, that depends to be seen in practice. But that certainly has been one of the cases. Again,
      it’s an ongoing thing, where you begin to see more of these attacks. I think the Israelis are
      estimated, at least from the IDF perspective, that they have one more week of targeting left. After
      that, they have to go back to the political leadership in Israel and say, “We have executed the
      target state that we were given. What do you want to do now?” Now, the leadership may decide to
      essentially expand their target list to economic assets, to civilian plans. That’s the decision for
      Prime Minister Netanyahu and his cabinet to make. But I think the existing target set that the
      Israelis have is likely to be concluded by next week. And then a series of decisions have to be made
      within Israel itself about how to proceed forward. Politics of this? I think everybody is now
      traumatized and stunned. And the regime at this point has a vast array of problems. There is some
      unification of the political elites from different factions of the Islamic Republic coming together.
      So, you have seen that. People more on the left or center, essentially joining together. The
      establishmentarians and the Iranian political establishment is a notoriously cantankerous one, but
      they have sort of come together. Now, the gulf between the state and society is likely to be
      enlarged. The nuclear program was presented as the most important national project of the country.
      Billions of dollars was spent on it. It was promised that nuclear science would revolutionize
      Iranian agriculture, Iranian industry, energy, and so on. They had issued stamps. They had the
      commemoration days, which were national holidays. Not just billions were spent, but trillions of
      dollars in economic opportunity was forfeited because of sanctions and investment not coming into
      the country as the nuclear program moved forward. Well, at least a significant portion of that
      civilian nuclear program lays in ruin today. And that’s a real experience. And so, the society as
      large, which I think also show classes at this point, I can say, with some confidence, are opposed
      to the Islamic Republic. That doesn’t mean they’re energized to come to the streets. In a
      referendum, the Islamic Republic will lose. Now, that’s different than being overthrown. So, all the
      social classes that are essentially aggrieved at the leadership, those grievances are not deepened.
      And even before this attack, the Iranian economy was a mess. And you have seen all corruption, and
      inflation, and currency devaluation. They couldn’t keep the lights on and heat in the schools and
      offices. They had to close offices and schools in order to provide enough heating and enough
      electricity for people’s homes. So, it’s like America during the pandemic. Schools were on two days
      here, off one week, two days here. And they would have a list of provinces where schools are open,
      list of provinces where schools are closed. And so, they were operating on a pandemic mode, but
      without the connectivity at home that the American people had. Not everybody, by and large. So, this
      is a huge problem for the regime.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And don’t you think, I mean, just feels from the outside that you’ve been told over and over this is
      our great enemy. We’re going to destroy them ultimately. They’re much smaller than we are.
      Obviously, one-tenth the size and population, maybe, something like that. And then they’re just
      being pulverized in a way, really, militarily, and total air dominance by Israel and whatever
      targets at this point. Almost Israel wants to hit, they hit and so forth. And I mean, just one
      wonders what that does to faith in the regime.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, that’s correct. And Israel was not just smaller and was presented in derogatory terms, but the
      part of the regime’s rhetoric was that Israel is a decaying society that’s fading away. That is all
      the people around it hate Israel, and so on and so forth. So, Israel was presented as a weak,
      decaying, and essentially a society on its way to extinction. Now, that’s not the experience today.
      They’re essentially trying to co-join the Israeli attack with American manipulation, suggesting that
      Americans were behind this, Americans were providing intelligence. Not unlike what the Nasser regime
      did in 1967, when it was defeated by Israel. And they said it was the British pilots and so on. That
      was not convincing to the Egyptians then. It is certainly not convincing to the Iranians today. But
      yes, they were just defeated with alacrity by the Jews. For those who claim, and for those who are
      animated by anti-Semitism, this is not a good experience. It will distort the regime’s cosmology
      because they have to decide. For a long time they were saying, “The sinister Jews are manipulating
      America.” Now they’re saying, “The sinister Americans are manipulating Israel.” So, they have to
      kind of reconsider the anti-Semitic narratives. Now, they can do that. They’re very good at that.
      But yes, this is a humiliating experience. It would probably have been less humiliating if they were
      attacked by the United States. Not better—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s interesting.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      … but less humiliating to the regime to have been attacked by the Americans, because it’s the
      superpower, it’s the colossus and so on, so forth. And the second thing that the regime has to
      explain, it has paid a huge price for its great power allies, China and Russia. It sells oil at
      discount to the Chinese. The Chinese are very exploitative in their relationship with Iran. And that
      doesn’t sit well with the Iranian people, because they’re limited to Chinese products which they
      don’t like. And they’re selling their oil at a discount rate to the Chinese and multinationals. And
      in terms of the Russian Federation, Iran was involved in a war in Central Europe, for which it had
      no particular interest at stake, ideological or practical. What happened to those great power allies
      that were supposed to come together? What happened to this access that was supposed to be so
      regenerating? The Russians have put out a statement, offered to mediate—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. What did happen? I’ve been sort of struck how much of—sorry to interrupt—the coverage, I take
      it, accurately. I mean, it’s all about Israel, Iran, and then the US, and it’s sort of like in
      previous Middle East crises and wars, one immediately asks about Russia and then maybe secondarily
      about China, but now China’s more of an international power. And it does feel to me like either
      people are ignoring what they’re up to or they’re not up to much. I mean—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, the first phone call that President Putin made to Prime Minister Netanyahu.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Isn’t that interesting? Yeah.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      And the Russians have offered to mediate. The Chinese have issued a ritualistic statement by their
      foreign minister saying that conflict should stop and cooler heads should prevail. So that’s another
      alliance that Iran had invested a great deal in. It saw itself as part of this new anti-American
      axis. They came to the Russians’ aids, they shipped a lot of the drone technology to China, which
      they could have used today. And the Russians, all they did was offer to mediate this dispute and
      call for calm. So that’s another angle that hasn’t worked out for the regime as such.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And do you think compared to 20… Remember, we had those big demonstrations in 2022, which did show
      an underlying, of course, dissatisfaction with the regime. Where did that stand a week ago, I guess
      I would say compared to 2022? And do you think this now supercharges some of those sentiments again?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, as brilliant as Israelis have been tactically, Israel could not have succeeded if there was
      not mass dissatisfaction with the regime in the regime’s own bureaucracy and own security organs. If
      the Israelis tried to bomb London, I doubt if bunch of English people would help them assemble
      drones in Regency Park. So—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So there was really a lot of cooperation.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It wasn’t just that the Israelis landed a lot of people secretly. There must’ve been a lot of
      cooperation from Iranians.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Oh, absolutely. The location of all these commanders. The fact that drone technology was smuggled
      into Iran, assembled within Iran, deployed from Iran against Iran. That’s both brilliant
      intelligence success, but also the level of dissatisfaction among the people who should not be
      dissatisfied with the regime, the security elite, the intelligence elites. If you’re losing those
      people, then you got real problems. The Islamic Republic will always experience a popular
      insurrection. It always has. In all those four decades, it has experienced demonstrations and
      protest movements for a variety of reasons. And it should be noted, it has always emerged
      triumphant. It did so in 2009, it did so in 2017, ’19 and ’22. ’22 took a longer time because of the
      nature of the conflict. It has experience dealing with this kind of a situation because it has
      encountered this kind of a situation so often. But the Islamic Republic honestly has not been in
      this situation, I would say, ever in this 46 years of existence. The closest comparison would be to
      the early days of the revolution, 1980, 1979, because a number of things were happening. You had a
      sort of an internal conflict between various post-revolutionary factions. You had ethnic separatism
      in the north with Kurds and Baluch and Arabs in the Khuzestan area. You had the Iran-Iraq war, and
      you had the hostage crisis with America. But at that time, the revolution still enjoyed popular
      support, which why the leadership was capable of surviving. Today, it is facing a similar degree of
      crisis without popular support and with the complicity of a significant, at least a portion of its
      elite, that are willing to provide state secrets to Iran’s foremost enemy, the state of Israel. So
      if there is another opposition movement emerge, and at some point I’m confident it will emerge, that
      opposition movement will confront a weaker regime. Will it succeed? Who knows? That remains to be
      seen. There’s so many factors involved. But the regime’s vulnerabilities at this point are
      particularly acute. Now, this is a dynamic situation. In four or five months, it may look very
      different. The regime may have regained its control, may have reinforced its domestic controls, may
      have revamped its security services, at least for the purposes of repressing its population, not
      necessarily defending its national territory. But still, that the challenge for them would be how do
      they deal with another particular crisis which could emerge over an issue that we don’t even think
      about. In September, 2022, a young Kurdish woman decided she’s going to improperly wear her
      religious attire and she was killed in custody. That has happened many times in Iran. Women who did
      not wear their religious attire were apprehended, some killed in custody. That particular occasion
      led to an explosive national protest movement. The previous one didn’t, and afterwards hasn’t
      happened. So there’ll be something that will provoke that spark and the regime will have to deal
      with it with possibly a more weakened state.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But your point that I haven’t heard others make much, that it seems like the elites themselves are
      weaker, perhaps more divided, more insecure. That is very important because that I think is often a
      key to the actual fall of regimes.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, it is hard. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s rare that they’re overthrown simply by popular protests from the bottom up. Right?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Right. It is hard to see how Israelis could have succeeded without some degree of cooperation from
      Iran’s security services, intelligence community, Atomic Energy Organization, the Revolutionary
      Guards, Ministry of Intelligence. You can’t have this kind of a success without that degree of
      internal cooperation. So that has to concern the leadership as they look to prospectively start
      purging and determining who’s in, who’s out.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And speak to leadership—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      And any political order that goes into purging itself comes out of those purges weaker.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And speaking of leadership, what about the supreme leader who’s, what is he? 86 years old, and—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      86 years old, yeah. Assuming he physically survives because there are reports that his life could be
      targeted, was considered a target, assuming he survives. And there is actually a problem with
      killing a national leader. It is a legally dubious proposition. This is not Nasrallah. He’s a leader
      of a recognized sovereign government. It’s generally not a good idea to commission the assassination
      of national leaders. That has to be said as a preamble to this conversation. If he survives, he will
      not be supreme. He may be a leader, but he will not be supreme because his cascade of
      miscalculations have led Iran into this position. By the way, he will have critics on the left, more
      importantly, on the right. On the right, there will be those who will say to him, and they did say,
      in the aftermath of October 7th, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rules of the game
      are different now. Israel will approach the Middle East differently than it has in the past. And you
      saw their intervention in the Gaza Strip. Subsequently, obviously Hezbollah. There were voices
      within the Revolutionary Guards, we know that by their publications that were saying, “If the
      Israelis have changed the rules of the game, then we should change the rules of our game. We should
      actually detonate a nuclear weapon.” That was the first time in 25 years of a nuclear crisis that
      the issue of weaponization came to the public. Previous to that, at least in the Republic discourse,
      the Islamic Republic had exercised message discipline. This is peaceful nuclear energy, this a
      fatwa, God doesn’t like it. All that all nonsense. This was the first time when things broke into
      the public and Ali Khamenei and others stepped in and essentially stopped the debate and stuck with
      their existing strategy of incrementally increasing the size of the nuclear program and putting it
      in a position where they could detonate at the time and place of their choosing. Well, those voices
      are going to come back in the deliberations of the state and say, “If we had the bomb, we wouldn’t
      be getting bombed.” And the dangerous aspect of this is that the Iranian nuclear program, whatever
      is left of it, is likely to be a clandestine one now. The Islamic Republic will probably no longer
      try to reconstitute a large civilian nuclear program, big plants in Natanz and so forth. It will try
      to have a surreptitious one with a purpose of detonation with alacrity. That’s the argument that
      they got to be making. Now, that argument has to be made in the context where their intelligence
      services are penetrated, their scientific establishment is beset, their Atomic Energy Organization
      building is destroyed, and there’s a possibility of intervention given that air defenses have not
      been constituted. But that’s the argument that he will hear from the right. From the left, his
      misjudgments would be viewed as different. And from the population, his misjudgments would be
      different. They would be criticizing him for his ruinous policies that has essentially destroyed
      this country. So he’s in a position where he’s a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot
      like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had
      never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in
      history of Britain. But he became a prime minister, came Suez, and he’s discredited. Ali Khamenei,
      if he had died at age 83, he would be remembered as one of the Middle East’s greatest
      revolutionaries. He helped defeat America and Iraq. He helped surround Israel with rings of fire. He
      brought the nuclear program to a point where it was elaborate and on the cusp of detonation. He had
      consolidated the regime and more importantly, consolidated its revolutionary values. Today, that
      obituary cannot be redeemed. Today, there’s a big footnote in there saying, “But…” So his authority
      is going to diminish, and the regime will have to, assuming it survives, recalibrate the elite
      structure. In Western lexicon, the civil-military relations, the civil-military balance of power is
      likely to have tilted toward the military and whatever’s left of it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. I mean, it is kind of amazing. I want to ask you in a minute whether that would make it
      more radical or less, but I also want to say, I mean, I guess it’s easy to say these things after
      the fact. In a way you’d think when Israel demolished Hezbollah, it turned out to have a very
      intricate and imaginative plan for doing so, and really one that had taken quite a long time. So
      clearly despite the disaster of October 7th, what that said about Israeli intelligence vis-a-vis
      Gaza, and in that region area, they clearly had been working on that other thing for a long time.
      You’d think, I suppose people will say this in Iran, right? You’d think, well, gee, if they have
      done all this planning for Hezbollah, we’re kind of the patron of… Hezbollah is us in a way that
      Gaza and Hamas are not quite, right? They supported Hamas but it’s not the same thing. And so maybe
      they’ve got stuff cooking for us that’s sort of analogous to what they did to Hezbollah, right? I
      mean—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      The events of past week could not have happened if the events in Lebanon had not happened.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Say a word about that. That’s the word I think.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, it’s—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s one of the deterrents was this ring of circle around Israel, right? That could cause so much
      damage.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      The idea that Hezbollah missile force could destroy Haifa. The idea that given the geographic
      proximity, Hezbollah’s vast arsenal of projectiles didn’t have to travel far. And essentially it had
      the entire Israeli society as a hostage. Once that front was disabled, and it was disabled with
      imagination and alacrity, once something happened that nobody thought would happen, Nasrallah was
      buried in his bunker. Because previously the argument was however bad Nasrallah is, and you’re
      hearing this argument about Khamenei, however bad Nasrallah is, he kept Hezbollah intact and he can
      be counted on to be pragmatic because he has learned lessons of 2006 about messing with Israel, and
      even when he was having rings of fire during the Hamas crisis, he wasn’t fully intervening. And that
      dispersed Hezbollah into various militias will be more of a security problem for Israel than a
      cohesive Hezbollah by a leader that has experience dealing with the state of Israel. Once the
      Israelis—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This is an argument made by some in Israel and some in the West, right?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      And certainly in the West. And Bill, in the past two, three years, Israelis have turned all the
      assumptions on their head. In the past three years, Israelis have essentially proven that force and
      power can work. In the past few years, Israelis have proven that everything you taught in your
      American university about the Middle East is not true. So they have essentially, once they
      demolished Hezbollah, it made this attack possible. I do think, frankly, Israelis are probably
      surprised at their own tactical success because I think all of us, Israelis included, had discounted
      how deep the rot was in the Islamic Republic, institutions had decayed so much. So, yes, it would
      not have happened, I think without the Israeli daring attack against Hezbollah. Why did Iran not
      take more contingency planning? By the way, they may have. They may have dispersed the enriched
      uranium in various places. They may have essentially dispersed centrifuge construction. They may
      have done those things. In any nuclear program in order to ensure survivability, you engage in
      redundancy, which is not cost-effective, but different plants. We do know that they had enriched
      uranium in all three known plants, Isfahan, Fordow, and Natanz. So they did disperse them, and they
      may have done so to make sure some remnants of the nuclear program and highly enriched uranium
      survived. So as far as we know that that has not happened, but that remains to be seen. But those
      contingency measures should have been taken. The second thing is just prior to this attack, the
      Trump administration offered Iran a deal that they should have taken because it was a fantastic
      deal. Whoever came up with it was brilliant because it met the domestic requirements of both United
      States and Iran, if the Iranians were not so ideological. It was essentially the proposal for a
      regional enrichment bank that would be constructed. Iran would be permitted to enrich uranium at
      home at the level of below 5% while that multinational enrichment plan was being constructed. Now,
      here’s what that deal meant. Iran can continue to enrich uranium, protect and safeguard it while
      that multinational enrichment bank was being created, which means half past never. So it met Iran’s
      essential requirements and it met America’s because the president can say, “I got an agreement
      that’s zero enrichment. But once we get this plan, it’s going to be a beautiful plan, it’s going to
      be the best plan ever, Iranians come into it, everybody comes into it.” So Donald Trump would have
      been the advocate of domestic Iranian enrichment. All Ali Khamenei had to do was say, “Hey, if there
      is an enrichment plan at this point, at some point, we’re happy to participate in it and forgo
      domestic enrichment.” He didn’t do that. Whoever devised that agreement for Steve Witkoff did a
      brilliant job. Nobody believed there’ll be a multinational regional enrichment involving American,
      Saudis and others. And by the time, if they got there, the Iranians could easily have said, “The
      Zionists have infiltrated it so we’ve got to do more investigation.” If they had taken this deal
      three weeks ago, we wouldn’t be in this position.

      It’s amazing how much I always like to talk about the contingency of history and dislike people who
      think everything is deterministic, give deterministic accounts. But I’ve got to say the Middle East,
      which generally seems to foil that notion of determinism, I mean, the last two years is really
      unbelievable. If it were a novel, you wouldn’t believe it. October 7th, the greatest failure in
      Israeli intelligence, certainly since ’73, basically. Netanyahu utterly discredited, really. I mean,
      how could this happen on his watch? The stain that he could ever overcome in his career, the whole
      society, I mean horrified and not—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      The ongoing hostage crisis.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Then the hostage crisis. Two years before that, you had the demonstrations against Netanyahu,
      clearly representing a majority of the country, or at least very much a large part of the country.
      And then the war in Gaza, which is very difficult for Israel and a lot of domestic criticism. Are we
      really doing too much? Are we really accomplishing what we need? Can you really get Hamas out? That
      one, that one looks more like a classic Middle Eastern, endless kind of slogging along, sort of
      mowing the grass every now and then but not really solving the problem. And then they have the
      Hezbollah’s success, and now we’ll see. But, maybe—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      And Syria, here’s what the Israelis—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And Syria. I mean, it’s really like it is jaw dropping just to have all this stuff reverse so
      quickly. Right?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      In Syria, the Iranians were planning to intervene militarily. The Israelis sent a message to them
      saying any military convoy that comes is going to get bombed. So in one sense the collapse of the
      Assad dynasty is also attributed to Israel. Bibi’s political fortunes, others know, Israel, as my
      dear friend Elliott Abrams say Bibi’s whole thing… he’s like Churchill in 1945. Thank you for
      winning the war, now could you go away?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Still it’s pretty… Better to go out of office with… if he’s demolished thoroughly or at least in a
      major way, the Iranian nuclear program. Maybe lead to even the fall of the government there, the
      regime, then to go on right after October 7th. So you got to say… I mean, I’m not saying that’s
      whatever his motive, I think he’s always cared about Iran a huge amount.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Yes, that’s right. That’s right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It just, as a kind of novelistic thing almost it’s kind of amazing. Amazing.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Yes, he stands as one of the most consequential Israeli leaders, but I’m not sure if that helps him
      politically three months down line.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No. That’s another…
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Because the nature of Israeli politics, such divisions in that, and Bibi is a divisive person within
      the Israeli body politic.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Very much. What do you think? So it sounds like you think some chance of the regime fracturing. I
      mean, there’s some who are very worried about that in the sense of it could end up worse for us,
      worse for our allies in the region. There’s some who say, look, whatever might be chaotic, it might
      be unpleasant, the new leaders might be military junta or something, but very hard to see how it’s
      more dangerous, and at least you buying… Will take them a while to get things back together anyway.
      Which of those is the better?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      I have always believed that the post Islamic Republic Iran will be substantially better than the
      Islamic Republic. You know why? Because what went before was better. This is a country with 2,500
      year of history. It has a very sophisticated civil society. It has 95% literacy rate. It has a
      middle class that is interested in participating in politics. It has political experience. It has a
      constitutional revolution. It has one of the oldest parliaments in history of the Middle East. It is
      certainly emasculated today, but even the Islamic Republic did not disband the parliament because it
      has a sort of a stature within the Iranian political imagination. So I think… I have enough
      confidence in the Iranian people to believe that they will construct a society that will meet their
      political demands, economic demands, and try to live peacefully with their neighbors. I think it’ll
      be like France— prickly, nationalistic state with asserting his nationalist priorities, particularly
      in the Gulf. I do think that. I don’t think it’ll be an easy ally of the United States. The Shah was
      not an easy ally of the United States, he helped bankrupt the American economy in the 1970s. He was
      one of the principal actors behind the price hikes. But I do think it’s better than an ideological
      regime that explains its environment through conspiracy theories and harbors deep enmities
      predicated on anti-Semitism, anti-liberalism, anti-Americanism. And so whatever happens afterwards I
      think is likely to be better than what is in place today, for the Iranian people, first and
      foremost, and people of the region, and to some extent the United States and the international
      community as well.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And it doesn’t seem to be, I mean, they’ll be prickly, but I don’t see why they would have
      inevitable massive conflicts with others in the region. They just don’t like each other much. But I
      mean…
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, they would assert their influence in the Gulf. They would be more of a participant in trying
      to dictate oil prices, like the Shah did. It would be a nationalistic… It would be animated by
      Persian nationalism.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Now, the Shah, people always talk about his imperial grandeur. He actually didn’t care much about
      the Arab East, about Syria. He mucked around a little bit in Lebanese politics, but he couldn’t
      understand it, nobody can understand it. He obviously had a very good relationship with Israel, with
      America. By the way, it wasn’t just America. By the end of his rule, he had a good relationship with
      all the leading powers. China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and all the leading regional
      powers, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. It was in Egypt in exile that he died. He was very
      cagey in the international scene, not so much in the domestic scene. So I think his successors will
      approach politics in that manner, international politics, and of course the successors of the
      Islamic Republic will be very much preoccupied with the mission of national reconstitution after
      damage that this revolution has done however many years is still in existence. The revolution has
      been profoundly damaging to the country. It’s been damaging, not in terms of international program
      sanctions and military intervention. The country has water shortage problems. It can’t generate
      electricity. Standards of living are persistently declining. It’s been catastrophic for the Iranian
      people themselves, and I always thought they deserve better.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, I think that’s correct. You know a heck a lot more about the Iranian people than I do,
      but there’s no reason they should have to put with this, and maybe this does bring that home. I’m
      curious, over the next week, three weeks, I don’t know how long a perspective makes sense, a month,
      what should people look for? What would be the tip-offs for you as you get up each morning and read
      5,000 websites and catch up on the news that things are going in one direction or another in terms
      of the internal cohesion of the elites, in terms of the popular support, in terms of could Iran,
      could we see a blockage of the Strait of Hormuz or terror? Are they still even capable of doing that
      kind of thing? I mean, what would you tell you which way or what way things might be going?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      The first thing that I think is notable is whether there’s an American intervention and how this
      conflict ends. If it ends with Fordow intact, then I think the Israeli military success has to be
      viewed as a qualified one, if not entirely redundant because if they have sufficient things in
      there, and assuming there’s not an elaborate clandestine program. So first of all is the question
      that David Petraeus was asked: “tell me how this ends.” The Israelis, I understand that IDF suggests
      it has one more week of targeting, and then it goes to the political leadership and say, what do you
      want me to do? And the political leadership can at that time say, we’re going to focus on the
      economic assets and so forth. If there’s a plan for more of a regime change military strike, then
      you would have to attack the economic sites as well, economic assets, because then essentially you
      want to cripple the country’s economy. You would have to attack the siege bases as well, because
      they’re the paramilitary force that tends to be deployed in—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So you would watch for that after, maybe not this coming… Let’s bracket Fordow, either we hit it or
      we don’t, either the Israelis have some fantastically imaginative way of dealing it or they don’t.
      But you would watch for whether maybe after a few days now the Israelis start to target non-nuclear
      related sites that would threaten the regime, actually?
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Correct. Yes, that’s right. That means they’re essentially trying to undermine the regime, and
      there’s already some indication that they’re doing that. They hit the state TV, that essentially
      prevents the regime from communicating with this population. So we’ll see what happens with that. In
      terms of actual the politics of the country sorting itself out, it would have to be subsequent to
      this crisis. Subsequent to this crisis, we’ll see who’s left in the military. We’ll see what happens
      to Ali Khamenei. We see if there’s a call for his succession. We see what the pressure is coming
      from the left or the right, and which one is he responsive to. It could go very dangerously. He
      could finally concede that we’re going to build a nuclear weapon, we’re going to do whatever we have
      to do. And also we are going to see, once the population takes account of this, right now the people
      are leaving their homes from the cities, they’re leaving their home from Tehran, once they come back
      and recalibrate their lives and take accountancy of all this, how they will react to the next regime
      outrage. And there’s always another regime outrage. So that the notion of how this will sort out for
      the Iranian politics is a post-crisis situation, is a post-crisis development, that’s when you see
      it. But we’re still very much in middle of a crisis, or at the beginning of a crisis or a beginning
      of the beginning of crisis, I don’t know where we are. But that’s kind of what you look for to see
      what kind of a regime can actually limp out of this, if any. And there’s another online possibility
      of a simple military coup by the Revolutionary Guards against the civilian leadership. I don’t see
      that happening because they’re very much intertwined. They require religious sanction for their
      violence. That’s just the way… They’re revolutionaries. The Soviets kept talking about Lenin and all
      that, Karl Marx and Engel and all that nonsense because they may not have understood it, but they
      needed those foundational text to justify their misrule. So that’s another thing you can look for.
      Moving forward, the other question you would have to ask yourself if the regime survived, what does
      a weakened but significantly aggrieved Islamic Republic mean for the future of the Middle East?
      Certainly weakened. It’ll be weakened for some time to come, but much more aggrieved and perhaps
      less cautious in terms of its approach to international. I don’t think they’ll close the Strait of
      Hormuz because they’ll alienate their last consumer of oil, the Chinese. I don’t think they’ll
      target American vessels because the last thing they want is further American intervention into this
      affair at this time. I do think down the line, they will try to, if they survive, get the Houthis or
      somebody to try to attack American installations or bases or something in the Middle East, try to
      revive terror networks to the extent that they still exist and that sort of a thing. But the
      principal challenge moving forward after this is what does a weaker Islamic Republic mean for
      regional security? And regimes that lose wars tend to behave in a very unpredictable ways. Because
      what the regime will have to do is reconstitute the fear barrier that it relies on for its rule at
      home. The regime, the rule is to fear. It has to have a success. Detonation of a bomb could be a
      success. Success saying to the Israelis and the Americans, “You gave us your best shot. Here’s your
      mushroom cloud.” And also to the Iranian people, not that a nuclear weapon would regenerate
      nationalism on behalf of the regime, but just to say to their public the argument that they made to
      the Americans. No matter what happens, we’re strong enough to survive, we’re strong enough to defy,
      and we’re strong enough to do the unthinkable, and we can do that to you more easily. That regime
      will have to essentially restore fear of itself, fear that the public has toward it, and also
      everybody else in the region. So a weakened but more dangerous Islamic Republic is also something to
      think about.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Are you surprised? We’re closer to this here by what it seems to me, but again, very much from the
      outside and not being at all expert and not knowing the languages, are you surprised by the relative
      lack of response in a way, by the neighbors, by Arab states, by others? I mean, they’re not really,
      I mean, someone asked me this. I’ll just preface the question this way. Someone asked me a couple of
      days ago, “You were in government,” he said. This is someone who was barely born in 1990, ’91 said.
      “You were in government back then. Didn’t Iraq attack Israel with missiles? Scuds?”
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Scuds, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I said, “Yes, and we put Patriots over there. We helped people who were… some of them made it
      through, of course.” And he said, “Well, what happened? Did I read that Israel didn’t respond? Why
      was that?” And I said, “It was a huge issue, but Bush and Baker felt very strongly and maybe
      correctly,” I don’t know. Certainly that was basically the international consensus that they
      couldn’t respond. You could not make it an Israel versus Iraq thing because once Israel’s in, it’s
      kryptonite for every Arab state, and they all have to get involved almost against Israel. Or in any
      case, it destroys our ability to hold our coalition together, even including maybe some of the
      Europeans, et cetera. I mean, I am struck that Israel has now attacked Iran, and I’m not saying this
      in a judgmental way as it were, but I mean, they did launch this attack. They would say that Iran’s
      nuclear program is progressing, et cetera, and the rest of the Arab Middle East, which not that long
      ago, was pretty allergic to Israel. It’s like, okay, well, I mean I don’t know. Are they doing
      anything about it? Are they even calling ambassadors? The ones that have ambassadors, are they even
      cutting off business relations? It seems pretty minimal, honestly. I don’t know.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      They didn’t even recall, I think Bahrain and Morocco may have recalled ambassadors during the
      intervention in the Gaza enclave. I think the Gulf Arab states want nothing to do with this because
      the last thing they want is a repeat of Iranian missiles attacking Saudi oil installations. And
      however bad Iranian missiles are, they could actually inflict damage on Saudi oil infrastructure.
      And given the lack of air defenses that Iran has had, even the Saudis may actually be able to return
      fire, which they ordinarily wouldn’t do. So at this point, they want have nothing to do with this.
      There had been, before this, an ongoing detente between the Gulf Arab states and the Islamic
      Republic. And the Gulf Arab states were essentially advising the Trump administration for some kind
      of a nuclear accommodation, some kind of a nuclear deal. Now, if the Iranians were smart, they would
      struck the Saudi oil facilities because that would make Prince Salman an advocate for the Iranian
      position in Washington. He would come and say, “Look, [inaudible] You guys got to stop Israelis. You
      got to put [inaudible] because this…” And that made have affect the Trump administration because at
      least momentarily it would have impacted global oil prices and put pressure on the American economy
      and the global economy with all the tariffs and all that. That would be a smart move for the
      Iranians to do just in terms of getting some lobbying effort on their behalf. But I think at this
      point, the variable that they have to think about is how the Chinese would react to that. Because
      China, as you recall, brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia a couple of years ago. And
      the essence of that agreement was that the Iranians would not attack Saudi oil facilities, and the
      Saudis would essentially tamper down their operations in Yemen where they were already losing the
      war. But Ali Khamenei didn’t get anything out of that agreement. They didn’t even care what happens
      to Yemen. So that’s the angle that they would have to think about at the time, should they come out
      of this conflict, they will need the Chinese commerce even more. Because that’s the only source of
      revenue they have for reconstituting an infrastructure that was dilapidated before this, and it’s
      been battered at this point. So they have to think about that. Also, whether or not the Trump
      administration will invoke the Carter Doctrine, namely the security of these matters to us, and we
      will intervene. It didn’t last time. Whether it will this time, who knows? So that’s a complicated
      calculation.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it is complicated, but it just strikes me so much. This is, I guess, an obvious point that
      people of my generation, older than you, but I guess our generation, I mean, the way we thought
      about Middle East politics for many, many years and decades, and I don’t think it was wrong to think
      about it that way. That’s just sort of the way it was. Israel is this outlier state, and, of course,
      there’s still many aspects of that. The Gaza conflict in a way, much more fits much more into that
      traditional, if you will, narrative. But I mean this, what’s happened over the last few years with
      Hezbollah and Iran, and then, of course, the Israeli rapprochement with some of the Gulf states or
      the Gulf states rapprochement with Israel, depending on how you think about it, the normalization of
      relations in some cases, which turned out to be stickier and stronger, I think, than a lot of people
      felt with Egypt and stuff. I don’t know. And then China and Russia having their own roles, but of
      course, Israel relations, there is some relations with Russia and China, too, right? So I mean—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, less so with China. China has more of this little anti-Semitist language that the
      Chinese have embraced has not sat well.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      As you say, it is interesting that Putin called Netanyahu before he called anyone.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Well, the other thing for the United States to think about is, is Israel now a regional power? It’s
      not an Arab East power that patrols its near abroad, but is it a power that can be relied upon to
      police the Middle East? And that actually, if we think about it that way, and I think we should
      think about it that way, essentially brings together different factions of the Republican Party. The
      traditional Reaganite faction that is attached to Israel, people like me, and the people in the
      Trump movement that want less footprint in the Middle East. Because now you have a power that
      properly armed, properly advised, properly intelligence briefings could potentially do it. The fact
      that Israel could reach that far and do that damage in this period of time, maybe Israel can now
      become the principal American power, essentially the Nixon two-pillar policy, but with one pillar,
      that pillar being Israel. And as you said, I’m not quite sure if the Arab states would find that
      displeasing, and in that context, why do you need the Abraham Accords?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, yeah, they help, I guess, just they can coordinate more the Israelis and the Saudis.
      Well, I think it really is another conversation we need to have in three, four, five months, because
      it really indicates how much this moment is not just pivotal for Iran, though that’s extremely
      important, maybe pivotal for Israel, but could be pivotal for the region.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Pivotal for the United States.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And for the United States.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      No, pivotal for the United States. Yeah. Suddenly, we have a very reliable, credible democratic ally
      that could do things in the region that all of us thought, frankly, were exaggerated and perhaps
      inconceivable.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I’ve also been struck, just again, before I let you go, but the Europeans, the G7 Summit that just
      finished in Canada, there was a joint statement that was pretty pro-Israel, I’d say, given the
      Europeans occasionally not being so pro-Israel, and especially given Gaza where they’ve been very
      much critical, obviously. And this was, I mean, the Israel versus Iran dynamic, if I can put it this
      way, is so different—I guess I should’ve known, of course, I should have known this, but I just
      didn’t really focus on it—than the Israel versus Palestinian dynamic. I mean, everyone has agreed
      that Iran shouldn’t have nuclear weapons. What everyone thinks of the JCPOA, the Europeans were on
      board it, and in being on board, they were saying, too, we need to have, they thought diplomacy
      would be the way to do it, but that we can’t, we have to diplomatically work very hard to stop Iran
      from having nuclear weapons. Why else put all that time and effort into—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      By the way, that has to do with the way Iran has messed up his relationship with the Europeans. What
      Germans don’t talk about is how often Germans are beat up in Iran. The diplomats are beat up. There
      are a lot of Germans in Iran—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, the assassinations in Berlin and so forth, it’s very striking that Merz, I thought, went out
      of his way to say, “Israel’s doing our job for us,” because—
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Correct.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Ray Takeyh
    text: |
      Yeah. So that has to do with how Iranians have messed up their relationship with the Europeans. One
      thing I would say, if the JCPOA was still in existence, we would be talking about how the Iranian
      nuclear program is coming online and has all the legitimacy and legal sanction of an international
      accord. We wouldn’t be in this position of disarmament.

      Interesting, interesting. Well, that’s another—

      For all those people in 2015, and I was obviously, as you know, fighting the Joint Comprehensive
      Plan of Action, they were accusing us… When it was finally negated, abrogated by Trump, they kept
      saying, “Are we better off because of this? Are we better off because of this? Yeah, I think we
      are.”

      But again, we might not have said that, as you say, three weeks ago, if Trump had accepted, if
      Khamenei had accepted Trump’s deal and suddenly would be in JCPOA, too, but even less enforceable or
      something and the snapback. So I mean, it is amazing how quick that reversal—

      And by the way, we might be in another US-Iran deal again.

      Well, that’s right. I mean—

      Who knows?

      We don’t know. I mean, that’s the main thing, too. Well, this has been a really stimulating and
      fascinating conversation. We do need to have this conversation again when we have more clarity,
      which I guess we’ll have at some point. But as you say, I think you make one very important point
      that is lost in some of the discussion, which is these things can take time, too. I mean, the way it
      might look at the beginning of July could be very different from the way it might look in September
      or December, right? I mean, the after effects a major—

      But, but, but this is a hinge moment. Things afterwards are going to be very different than before,
      and we just don’t know how different.

      That is a good note to end on. Ray Takeyh, thanks so much for joining me again.
