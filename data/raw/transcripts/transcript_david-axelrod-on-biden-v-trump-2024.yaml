      Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined, for the second
      time on these conversations, by my friend David Axelrod, a man with many titles. We were joking
      about this, CNN commentator, Hacks on Tap podcast host, founding director of the Institute of
      Politics. I had the pleasure to serve on that advisory board with him where he did an excellent job
      for 10 years at the University of Chicago. Probably tougher to manage the Institute of Politics at
      the University of Chicago than run a couple of presidential campaigns, right?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Well.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Students, faculty, all those people.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Actually, easier than many, easier than most. I can point to a few institutions, including the one
      you attended, where I think it would be more difficult.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no. I give Chicago credit for making it a hospitable environment and one where… and you insisted
      on real free speech and civil discourse. It was very appreciated.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I should point out that Bill Kristol has been an eminent board member of the IOP from its inception,
      and we try and reflect his temperament and civic values.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I rubber stamp David’s decisions, but that’s what board members are for, of course. Most
      importantly, for this conversation, obviously, and most famously the top campaign strategist and
      President Barack Obama’s—Senator Obama’s—2008 campaign for the presidency, and then his successful
      reelection in 2012, which is really what I want to focus on today. I guess you ran the most recent
      successful reelection campaign in America.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah. We came to take for granted that presidents would be reelected. We had a string of
      reelections. George W. Bush got reelected. I guess you were involved in an unsuccessful reelection.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Thanks. Yeah. I was the one exception in the Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama streak. They needed me to
      come into the George H.W. Bush White House to break that to me.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, Carter in there, but Nixon got reelected and then curtailed, but we had a period of time when
      there was tremendous advantage to being an incumbent president, and we’ll see if that holds. In this
      election, we have this unusual situation where we have basically two presidents running against each
      other. Right now, I think you’re seeing the advantages and disadvantages of incumbency at the same
      time. Biden’s raising a lot of money. The bully pulpit that you and I used to talk about has been
      sort of fractionated, so it’s not what it was. Trump, it’s interesting. He’s getting the value of
      incumbency and yet still running as an insurgent. It occurs to me, he’s always been, even when he
      was president, he was an insurgent. That’s a comfortable place for him to be, but he’s not raising
      the money.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Though that will come, I suspect if it’s competitive. Well, let’s go through what will be
      incumbency is such an important issue. Let’s talk about, so what would you, you’ve been through it.
      You’ve actually run one of these, they call you in it’s what, seven months ago? Really? Six months
      ago until voting begins. Begins in late September. It’s not quite as far off as everyone says. Let’s
      just assume you’re helping President Biden and not former President Trump, and they call you in and
      say, “Okay, what do we need to do? Let’s be practical here and forward-looking, I guess, and what do
      we need to do? Where do we stand? What do we need to do? What’s the biggest challenges?” Then we can
      go through a whole thing for how do you make a better case for Biden? How do you make a better case
      against Trump? How do you deal with RFK Jr? Let’s just give me the top line first. I mean, where do
      we stand?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, let’s start off with a small question. Look, I think that campaigns are all about narratives
      and we talk about issues, but issues are subsets of larger narratives. The Republican message, the
      Trump message is that the world’s out of control and an enfeebled aged Biden is not in command.
      That’s the Republican message for this election campaign. It seems to me that A, you have to be
      aware of that and counter that, and he’s not going to run a half marathon, so that’s out. But you
      have to have strategies to deal with that, but you need to know what your own narrative is. I mean,
      elections when your message is right is about the future, and my argument would be Biden’s fighting
      for you and your future. Trump is consumed by his past and fighting for himself, and I would sort of
      build the campaign around that. We live in a very unsettled time, and that has made Biden’s task
      harder. I think we have a post-pandemic PTSD. You can see the wrong track number that we always talk
      about in politics has remained pretty negative, people’s view of the world. I think that’s amplified
      by and fueled in many ways by social media, which thrives on the negative. What I wouldn’t do, and I
      just was fulminating about this on my own podcast, on the Hacks on Tap podcast, I wouldn’t go out
      there and extol the miracle of the Biden economy. It just drives me crazy when he does that. He was
      on the Today Show yesterday and he got asked by Al Roker about a very simple question. It was at the
      Easter egg hunt, and Roker asked, “A lot of people are worried that their bucks aren’t going as far.
      What do you tell them?” Instead of sort of doing what you’d expect Joe Biden to do, because he’s a
      person of empathy who grew up in a working class circumstance and identify with the concern, he
      said, “I would tell him we’ve got the strongest economy in the world.” He continues to do that. That
      is the wrong strategy. The right strategy is to say, “Look, we’ve made a lot of progress from when
      the day I walked in the door as a country, and I’m proud of our country for fighting through this
      pandemic and getting our back to where we’ve got this much employment, but the fact is, the way
      people experience this economy is the way I did when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How
      much did you pay for the groceries? How do you afford the gas, the rent? These continue to be a
      problem and I’m fighting that fight.” Then I go through a few things that, so I think he needs to
      put himself on the side of working people in their economic fight here. That’s what we did in 2012.
      I mean, you remember, Bill, we were still very much feeling the effects of the great recession. We
      were out of the recession, but people still were stung by the experience of it. If we went out and
      claimed economic mastery, we would’ve lost.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      But instead, we spent 14 months talking about the future and whether we’re going to have an economy
      that works for working people, for the middle class, for people who want to be middle class, is work
      going to be rewarded or are we going to have an economy where only the people, only the hale and
      hearty succeed, and in an environment in which people are very jaundiced about Wall Street in that
      election? That was very important message. Romney, of course, was not well positioned to fight with
      us on that. I think Biden has to get himself on the right side of these, on the economic fight.
      They’re doing stuff, and I know this is supposed to be a conversation and you put in a quarter and
      now you’re getting 10 plays, but I’m just about done here. He’s doing stuff. I mean, the Justice
      Department just went after some real estate interests for price fixing on rents. The FTC just issued
      a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain
      issues from the pandemic. It turns out that they’re jacking it up way beyond what their costs
      increases were. They’re fighting these fights, but not really highlighting them to the degree I
      would in a campaign like this. Bottom line, be more like Joe from Scranton and less like President
      Biden from Washington. Put yourself on the side— because those are the voters, Bill, who are going
      to decide this election; working class people, Black, white, and Hispanic, who are very much
      scuffling still in an economy that’s improved, but in which cost of living has aggregated and
      continues to be an obstacle.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s just so hard when you’re the incumbent president and incumbent president’s team to get them not
      to defend their record. Let’s put it this way, not to have them … They want to spend 80% of their
      time defending their record and explaining why they’re doing better than anyone realizes, and 20% of
      the time talking about what they still want to do in the second term and so forth. Of course, what
      you’re saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I don’t even.. I’m sorry, go ahead.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, I saw this in the Bush— You were kind enough to point out though the one losing the election
      campaign, luckily until we had Trump.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I just want to credential you.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Thank you. Yeah, that’s right, but now it was very hard. I mean, George H.W. Bush was proud of a lot
      of things he had done, but mostly foreign policy, which then became less important after at the end
      of the Cold War, but also Americans with Disabilities Act and the budget deal and Clean Air Act. It
      was reasonable for him to be proud of it, and maybe we certainly could have done a better job of
      explaining it all and defending it, but very hard to get an incumbent president and team, I think,
      to run a forward-looking campaign. You did that in 2012. You had the advantage of the economy having
      collapsed on the previous Republican administration, so little—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, I mean, I don’t know how much that was of some benefit, but—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Not as much—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I also have the advantage of a guy who I always say it’s, you always look good driving a Maserati.
      He was very agile. He was a very good candidate and could carry a message in a way that we needed
      to. One thing about that ‘92 election—not to belabor the point, but I think there are lessons from
      it—you remember, I think Bush showing going into a grocery store because someone decided, Hey, maybe
      we better, there’s concern about the economy and being unfamiliar with I guess the reader or
      something.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The scanners were new at that point. This was a bum rap. We had a complicated explanation at the
      time, which we wasted two weeks trying to persuade people why this was a bum rap.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It abetted a portrait of him as a guy who was an effete, who was out of touch with the lived
      experience of Americans in this case. I don’t think people think Biden is unaware of the lived
      experience of Americans, but they think that he is out of touch right now and they blame age for it.
      He’s got to show that he’s very much in touch with what’s going on in the experience of everyday
      people when they visit the grocery store, when they pay their rent, when they pay their mortgage,
      when they go to the… I always watched gas prices very closely when I was in the White House, and
      these are the ways… you don’t necessarily watch all of these economic indices, but what you do watch
      is the numbers going up on the gas tank when you’re filling your gas on the gas dispenser, whatever.
      When you’re filling your gas tank. You do look at the cash register when you’re buying groceries.
      There just needs to be more attention to that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think, David Plouffe said to you recently on a panel you did, that’s a very good… your colleague
      in 2008 and 2012.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, brilliant campaign manager. Great—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Great campaign manager. He said something about how there’s always a temptation to want to lecture
      the voters about how you should be happier than you are. The right message is, I understand why
      you’re unhappy.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s so hard for me, but I guess you’re saying that’s very important, right?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      That’s number, that’s rule… That’s number one. The second thing is you need to make this a very
      comparative campaign. You cannot allow this to be a referendum in an environment in which 65% of the
      country feels like things are on the wrong track. People need to understand this is a choice now.
      It’s not a choice between, as Biden used to say, between him and the Almighty. It’s him and the
      alternative. The alternative is deeply, deeply flawed. I mean, Donald Trump is consumed by his past,
      his program for the future. Yes, he would like people to feel that it’s about the economy and
      immigration, but it’s really about retribution and revenge and his own aggrandizement. He has no
      space, time or interest in the experience of everyday people or the things that they’re going
      through. He has no sense of empathy. He views everything through the prism of Donald Trump, and that
      should be a real advantage for Joe Biden and that they should press that through a variety of
      issues. I don’t think any ad they run should be a positive ad. I think they should run nothing but
      contrast media, potentially negative ads in spots, but they put up an ad today, Bill, about abortion
      rights. That was a very simple comparative that starts with Trump bragging about being the guy who
      brought down Roe versus Wade and Biden narrating talking about—which is a good thing—talking about
      his commitment to abortion rights and his trust in women. It’s a very, very effective spot. I think
      that’s a prototype for, it’s a template for what they should be doing from here to the end. Donald
      Trump should be in the narrative from here to the end.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. And which aspect? Well, let’s pivot to Trump. I mean, there’s so many things we can go
      after, obviously on Trump, his personal character, the lies, the January 6th, his actual policies,
      things he did in the first term, things he’s promising to do, which are scarier in my opinion in the
      second term. He also wants to destroy NATO and is pro-Putin, I mean, how do you juggle all—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Deport Bill Kristol.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What’s that?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Deport Bill Kristol, I think is one.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That tests well, unfortunately. Biden probably shouldn’t feature that. Which aspects do you feature?
      The kind of the policy side, the personality side?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah. I think the temptation is to focus on just morality, ethics, democracy, and so on. But I keep
      saying to people, if you’re speaking, I feel deeply about it. You feel deeply about it. We are
      bonded in this notion that democracy depends on rules and laws and norms and institutions. If your
      president is about the business of destroying them all, that is a fundamentally threatening
      prospect. That said, I suspect that if you’re sitting around the kitchen table talking about the
      future of democracy, you’re not worried about the cost of the food you’re eating. You’re not worried
      about your rent and your gas. I do think that the voters, I think ultimately the voters who care
      deeply about democracy and about Trump’s sundering of it are going to vote for Joe Biden. I think
      that the real challenge for the Biden campaign is to reach people for whom that might not be the
      primary concern. That for whom, I think, principally economic issues are the concern, but also they
      have concerns about personal safety, and many have concerns about the viability of their childrens’
      future. And a lot of young people who are disillusioned, we talk about abortion rights, which is a
      motivator for young people, we talk about how the war has affected young people and so on. But you
      get into focus groups with these young people, and our friend, Sarah Longwell, who does such
      brilliant work, will probably attest to this, they have real concerns about their own economic
      viability. So I would contrast what Biden is doing, and will do, with what Trump has done, and will
      do, on things that very much affect people’s lives, and I would not count on the shock and dismay of
      people over the fact that the guy’s under 91 criminal indictments, or that he engineered an
      insurrection, and so on, I think you’re going to get that for free, but it’s not enough to win.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Our friend, Doug Sosnik, in one of these conversations said the alarm bells really went off for him,
      and in fact, this is when Trump really took the lead, about September, October, slightly, in the
      polls, when voters started saying that, retrospectively, they felt that they had done much better
      personally, economically—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes, yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …in the Trump administration than Biden. And since, as you said at the beginning, it’s two
      incumbents, most recent president and the current president, it’s a tough uphill slog, it seems to
      me, if they’re looking at these two presidencies, they’re not looking, unlike with Romney and the
      current presidency—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …and someone who, if he were successful, would define himself as bringing about a brighter future,
      but you succeeded in defining him as threatening a brighter future. Here, you’ve got two records,
      and if they think they did better under Trump, how do you dislodge that? Or do you just forget about
      the past and almost make it all about—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Well, first of all, let me say it is really interesting. We tend not to credit people with good
      sense, but most people have good sense, and so they’re kind of giving Trump a pass on the final year
      of his administration—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      …because they say, “Well, that was the pandemic, he couldn’t help it.” To some degree, perhaps, they
      will give Biden some… If Biden adjusts his economic talking points, I think they may give him some
      credit for managing through a difficult thing and understanding the burdens of that. But yeah, this
      is a concern that Trump’s ratings, just as president, there’s this gauzy reminiscence of Trump. Now,
      I think some of that may be allayed, and this may conflict with what I just said, but I don’t think
      the two are contradictory. I think one of the reasons that Trump has begun to slip a little, and
      there’s been some progress for Biden in the last six weeks or so, some of it has to do with Biden
      being more energetic and the campaign getting more on track, but I think some of it has to do with
      the primary season ending and Trump getting general election consideration now, and people focusing
      on the fact that, “Oh, yeah, he could be president again. This is the choice.” And now, we got quite
      a bit of coverage of him over the Easter weekend, he always seems, Bill, able to celebrate these
      holidays by just… He celebrates the sacred by engaging in the profane.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It’s really, really weird. But he just erupts over Christmas, over Easter. I don’t know whether it’s
      because he’s confined. I posited on Hacks On Tap that he’s jealous that Christ gets all this
      attention. I don’t know. I don’t know what it is. But his outbursts over the weekend just remind
      people that the guy is nuts, and living with him is like a… I saw some guy in a focus group say, he
      was a guy who voted for Trump before, but said he couldn’t again, and he said, “Trump as president
      is like having a neighbor who runs a jackhammer 24 hours a day,” he says, “Just exhausting.” And so,
      I think there’s some element of that that will erode some of these gauzy memories. But I think the
      Biden campaign has to remind people, and you and I, we may have a difference of opinion on this
      particular piece of policy, but the one signature achievement of the Trump administration was a $1.7
      trillion tax cut that primarily favored corporations and wealthy people.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It is the single most negative thing, up there with abortion rights, but it is more broadly
      impactful. And you talk about that, his inaction on pharmaceutical prices, a whole range of issues
      on which, on economics, he’s just in the wrong place. And if there is a presumption that goes to Joe
      Biden for having some sense of the way real people, or average people, live… I think Trump gets a
      lot of points for cultural signification with working class people, but on economics, I think you
      can hammer him. And I think you have to remind people, get them to think about the future, about do
      they want someone who’s going to take on the pharmaceutical companies? Do they want someone who’s
      going to take on predatory interests, who raise costs? Do they want someone who’s going to fight for
      healthcare rather than dismantle the Affordable Care Act? I think there are places where Trump is
      very vulnerable, and people aren’t as focused on it as they can be.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, the cultural stuff is so appalling. Certainly, people like me and you, I think, and many
      others, and certainly in Biden’s circles and President Biden himself, I’m sure, the bigotry, the
      nativism, the mean-spiritedness, the demonizing of opponents, the total disregard for the rule of
      law, that one does tend to focus on that, whereas the populist economic argument might actually be
      more effective, as you say, this—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I fundamentally believe that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …is the problem with these modern campaigns. Biden hangs out with Democratic donors who aren’t that
      populist, if we could be honest, on economics.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      No, they’re actually more like Republican donors used to be.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      They’re wealthy and comfortable.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And then, he has activists in his party who care a lot about, let’s say, the left’s cultural issues,
      and in a weird way, who’s telling him to actually focus on mainstream, let’s call it, new deal-like—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Bread and butter issue.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …New Deal-like semi-populist…
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Bread and butter issues.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Bread and butter issues. I think that Biden needs to embrace them, and they need to hammer them,
      they need to hammer them consistently. I really do believe Biden’s problem isn’t with suburban…
      Obviously, he wants to run up the score there, but he’s doing pretty well there, he’s doing pretty
      well with highly educated white voters. He’s not doing all that badly. He’s doing badly, as
      Democrats have for several cycles, with white non-college voters, but young people… Listen, the
      Biden Coalition in 2020 very much relied on, he got 87%, 88% among African-American voters, he got
      65% among Hispanic voters, he won young voters by 20 or more. All of these constituencies are soft
      now. Trump’s getting upwards of 20% in most polls of African-American voters, Hispanic voters are
      running even now, even young voters are running even.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      And so, I think in some ways, you have to really think about, how do you get at least a necessary
      share of those voters back? And there too, I think, economics is as important as anything. So
      everything leads me back to those economic issues.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      Interesting. Which is slightly contrary to the general tendency of the media to want to focus on
      whatever the latest cultural outrage is. Someone made a good point to me, the Bible stuff last week
      with Lee Greenwood—

    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …the grifter, huckster $59.99 Bible where you get some American documents and Lee Greenwood song.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I want to know, by the way, is Trump going to produce Trump-branded Passover Haggadas?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, from Maxwell House to Trump…
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Don’t even give him the idea. Jared Kushner and those guys, they’ll be on top of it and it’s going
      to be a nightmare, we’ll be dealing with it for decades, just like Maxwell House, they’ll never go
      away.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Exactly.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I don’t know, I was actually not that upset about the Bible and all that Lee Greenwood stuff, but I
      was talking with someone about it, and he doesn’t follow politics that much, but he’s smart, he
      said, “Look, that’s just Trump. Of course, everyone knows he’s a huckster and a grifter. You can
      scream and yell about that, but there’s not one voter who doesn’t know that, including Trump voters,
      they know that’s what he does. But at the end of the day, what’s he doing? People are voluntarily
      spending $60, maybe foolishly, on a King James Bible.”
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Cheaper than the gym shoes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, with American documents attached. But that’s not an effective argument against him. At the end
      of the day, oh, fine, he’s marketing Bibles. Other people sell… There’s a way in which we all… We,
      but a certain type of… A lot of people in the media, I’d say, really want to go after him on the
      cultural signifiershttps://gettrumpsneakers.com
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …and not so much on, as you say, the bread and butter issues.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Well, even, I recoil from, after this last weekend, everybody’s hair was on fire because he, except
      Jon Stewart, he had a great bit on this last night, because some guy had on his bumper

      Biden.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      …phonied-up artwork of Biden bound in the back of his truck. And there is so much out there, so many
      people out there saying, “Don’t give Trump a platform, don’t let Trump…” I have the opposite view,
      which is I think more of Trump is better out there, because I do think people need to be exposed to…
      He’s crazier now than he was in 2016, and even 2020, although it’s hard to compete with telling
      people to drink or inject bleach to fight… But he’s kind of scary crazy, and people need to
      understand the choice. I can’t stand this notion that if we censor him, it’ll all be okay. That’s
      not the case. And I think he’s profited, actually… I was relieved when he got taken off Twitter,
      because it was a migraine headache every day and it was provocative. But now, he’s micro channeling,
      to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just… All that said, Bill, that’s just an
      aside, I’m just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don’t think, at the end of the day,
      that the campaign should be based on all of that. The campaign should be based on fundamental
      quality of life issues, and people need to know there’s a choice, and am I better off with this
      choice or that choice, and why? And I do think you look at these two guys, and one thing that is
      absolutely crystal clear is that one guy, leaving aside the issue of age and efficacy, I would argue
      he’s been much more effective than he gets credit for, but one guy is focusing on a set of issues
      that will impact positively on the quality of life of most Americans, and the other guy is
      completely consumed by himself and his own interests, and I think that’s something people need to
      focus on.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. He’s an effective demagogue and he’s a good entertainer, in his own way,
      and I agree with you, he’s in a way a little crazier than he was, but he is also better, in some
      ways, at being a demagogue than he was, because he’s really discovering what works.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      He’s good. Listen, no one should underestimate Donald Trump.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s always been my keep.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      He’s a feral genius—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      …that is very, very clear. And even the stuff that we’re all… I’m appalled that he put a target on
      the judge’s daughter’s back over the weekend and published her photograph, because there are crazy
      people out there. I’m worried about another Paul Pelosi situation—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      …where someone is motivated by all of this. That said, what he’s doing is he is doing what he always
      does. He knows that he is at risk of being convicted in this trial in New York, and he’s branding
      it. He’s branding the whole event as a partisan, as he would call it, witch hunt and so on, and he’s
      just going to do that relentlessly, just as he did by the way he branded the 2020 election in
      advance.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      He said in advance, “If we lose, it will have been stolen.” It wasn’t something that he thought of
      that night. He worked on that project for months. This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be
      alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these… These are strategies. This isn’t just
      expressions of outrage on his part, they’re strategies, and we need to call them out for what they
      are.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, yeah, I’ve very much thought that, therefore, I don’t really like the, “He’s popping off
      again, it’s all instinct with him and anger.” And there’s, of course, a lot of that, God knows, but
      yeah, there are these branding strategies, he’s been doing that for 50 years, marketing—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …and he’s unfortunately good at it. I said to someone the other day, I was critical of the Biden
      campaign, but I was sympathetic, I said, “It’s tough to run against Trump, he’s a tough opponent.
      He’s, in his own crazy way, a very skilled politician of a certain type.” And the person looked at
      me like I was just crazy. “Trump is not skilled at anything. Trump is a lunatic. Trump is crazy. He
      can’t control himself. He says one stupid thing after another.” But I think that’s a mistake among
      Liberals and Democrats. Some of it’s true, but it’s a mistake to dismiss him in that way.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It was… What was the line from Casablanca, when Humphrey Bogart is talking to the Nazi guy, and the
      Nazi was ridiculing blundering Americans, and he said, “I wouldn’t be too hard on them, I was with
      them when they blundered into Paris,” in whatever the year was.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      So you can call Trump a blunderer, but he blundered into the White House, so you’ve got to take him
      seriously. So a few other things I would be thinking about if I were Biden, one is I do think he’s
      getting chippier. I’ve said, for a long time, I would encourage that, but I would encourage it in
      ways like this, I think he should say stuff like, “I don’t think acting like a jackass makes you
      strong.” Just colloquial, direct take on that whole sort of strength persona of Trump. I mean, just
      sort of bits of Bidenisms that make Biden look both strong and rooted. So that would be one thing.
      He joked with him the other day about spotting him three strokes on a golf course if he would carry
      his own bag. I’m not sure golf is the medium or the image that I would… But a couple more, in terms
      of campaign, is I would very much… Plouffe said this on our conversation the other day at Arizona
      State University, Plouffe and Rove and I. I guess, Plouffe and Rove and me. He said that a lot of
      the campaign is happening below the surface. Social media, a lot of the voters who Democrats need to
      reach are not watching Nightly News , they’re not reading newspapers; that was David’s point. They
      are getting a lot of their information on social media. For young people, TikTok and Instagram are
      very important. Biden has not been very competitive there until recently. Trump, first of all, his
      stuff lends itself to social media, and the memes about Biden’s age lend themselves to social media
      and so on. But Biden needs to compete on social media, and they’re getting better at it. They’ve got
      to get a lot better at it. When Trump does crazy ass stuff that is in their message frame, they need
      to get that out fast, and they’re doing more of that. But that’s going to be a big battleground. A
      lot of these disaffected or disinterested voters are there, I’m not sure that the strategy to get
      those voters back is in place completely yet. He also has this money advantage, and he needs to take
      advantage of this in these battleground states by out-organizing Trump. There was a peace bill this
      last week in Arizona about how what complete disarray the Republicans are because their party is at
      war with itself. They’re broke. The Trump campaign has no resources or hasn’t applied any resources,
      so they have no organization. Four years ago, Trump had 60 organizers on the ground already. Now,
      he’s got like six. Democrats ought to press that advantage organizationally in the battleground
      states. By the way, we were talking about this on Hacks On Tap . In terms of motivating voters,
      getting these choice initiatives on the ballot is really useful. So they’re working on that in
      Nevada, I think in Arizona. There are some other states that are less battleground states where
      they’re working on getting something on the ballot. That will bring younger voters out. The Florida
      Supreme Court ruled yesterday, they put it on the ballot. I doubt Florida’s going to be in play, but
      it’s going to make it more competitive. The other thing about it, Bill, is it’s going to force
      Donald Trump to decide to say publicly whether he supports the—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Which he won’t say right now. We had a piece in The Bulwark this morning… late last night by Marc
      Caputo that Trump refused to answer. He’s a Florida voter. He’s going to be on the ballot, voting
      presumably in November, and he won’t say whether he’ll vote for the constitutional amendment
      preserving abortion rights in Florida or not, which is… I mean, Trump is clever in the sense that
      he’s right, I think to be wary of that issue, and right to try to straddle it and duck it. But a
      good campaign could make it harder for him to straddle it and duck it.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Partly because of DeSantis, he attacked the six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed, that Supreme
      Court in Florida affirmed yesterday that is going to have reverberations nationally. This issue is
      going to be a real problem for Trump, and he’s going to have a hard time navigating it from now
      until election day.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      God, there’s so much we could talk about and this is also interesting. I just went through a bunch
      of things. The Haley, Chris Christie, Liz Cheney sort of supporters out there, whatever number of
      Republicans and semi-Republicans there are. I mean, the Haley voters are the most concrete example.
      There were hundreds of thousands of them in battleground states, more than the margin in Michigan
      and Georgia, and I guess North Carolina, too. Anything special about getting some of those voters
      [inaudible] for Biden. Some of them are just Republicans, but there are some of them in the middle.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I prefer to call them Bill Kristol Republicans.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      There you go. Yeah. They’re already for Biden, the Bill Kristol Republicans. These Haley voters are
      undecided.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, they are, but what were the centerpieces of her campaign? They had to do with national
      security issues, and that’s a place where Biden should press his advantage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I so much agree with that, if I could jump in there, and I don’t think they understand that. They
      think, look, the war in the Middle East is very difficult; Ukraine is difficult in its own,
      obviously, is an actual practical policy matter; and they’re a little timid about making it an
      issue. I think I was told by someone very close to Haley herself, but to the campaign that they were
      surprised as they went forward at the response she got on Ukraine, NATO, Putin. They kind of thought
      you should talk initially about the debt and the deficit. Remember she talked a lot about that early
      on. Trump had been a big spender.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, that was her initial thrust. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      He wasn’t a traditional Republican. No one cared about that. But a lot of Republicans do think we
      should not be pro-Putin and NATO has helped to keep the world safer than it would otherwise be for
      the last 80 years, and that’s an issue. We’re there with Biden unambiguously. It’s not like some of
      these other issues where they’re in between the two, and I feel like the Biden people could do much
      more to really press that a little.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I was disappointed that they didn’t make more. At the time, when Trump single-handedly killed the
      bill that had funding for Ukraine, Israel, the border, Taiwan, all in one package, and it was
      negotiated by a very conservative Republican, Senator Lankford, who got left out to dry there. Biden
      got down to the border three weeks later. They should have flooded the zone in the moment, and
      that’s what they have to be better at. They need to understand that it’s not just a one-off thing.
      You’ve got a hammer, hammer, hammer away. Because when you’re sick of saying something, that’s about
      when the average American has begun to hear the message. And so they’ve got to be better at that. So
      this national security thing, I think, is important. One thing, Bill, that I would hope they would
      be organizing is a show of force among former secretaries of defense, former chairman of the joint
      chiefs, former senior military and national security leaders of both parties to, at a strategic
      moment, stand up and say, “We are Republicans and Democrats and independents. We as a practice don’t
      involve ourselves in campaigns, but we believe that a second Trump presidency would represent a
      national security threat, and it would advantage the Chinese. It would advantage the Russians. It
      would weaken or destroy NATO. It would put ultimately our own interests at risk and our own young
      men and women at risk.” I mean, I think a message like that would be powerful.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, I agree. I think people are working on that, we’ll see how much they can deliver that.
      Let’s see, what else? The Democratic Coalition, we can say a word more about that if you want the
      younger voters. Anything magic about… You need to both get them back, get the percentages back
      closer to where they were in 2020 and get them to vote also. Right. There are two problems.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I think two things. I think the comparative is really important here. And secondly, I do think,
      Bill, the war has been very, very damaging. I think the economic issues are primary in many ways,
      but the war has been very, very damaging, and it’s something that has been worked on relentlessly on
      TikTok and Instagram. I suspect that some of the forces working it are not domestic political
      parties but maligned foreign interests, but it has the level of discord about it among young people.
      Let me say, I haven’t had this discussion with you, but I think you can hold two thoughts at once. I
      do. I’m the son of a Jewish refugee who knew violence and death as a child, and I’m strongly pro-
      Israel, and I mean my sense of horror and outrage and indignation about October 7th was as strong as
      anyone’s. That said, I still weep when I see a starving Palestinian child, I still weep when I see
      families destroyed. And I think the passion of these young people… Some of it is misinformed, some
      of it is unfair, but a lot of it is them reacting to what they’re seeing. I wonder if they’re
      focused on what the difference would have been had Donald Trump been president at the time this
      happened, because he would have applied no restraint. He would not have been an advocate for
      restraint or for humanitarian aid. By the way, we should say a word about the seven World Kitchen
      Central folks who were killed in Gaza, apparently by Israeli forces accidentally, Prime Minister
      says. I take him at his word on that. But this is just a horrific situation. So that’s a long way of
      saying one hopes this is at a different place come November, and that people rec— It’s World’s
      Central Kitchen. I got that wrong. One hopes that by November, there will be a different situation,
      that the war will be over, that some rebuilding will be done, that there’ll be some discussion of
      what comes next that includes Palestinians in that discussion. But this is a real thing, and Biden’s
      not getting the credit for what he has done. He’s getting the blame for more than he should, but it
      is the lot of being President of the United States at a time of war.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, this is the incumbent… Sarah finds it, [inaudible] finds this a lot in the focus groups. The
      world seems chaotic, and Biden doesn’t seem to be on top of this now.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s what I said at the beginning. That’s a Republican message.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s a little unfair. I mean, the world could be chaotic. It’s not Joe Biden’s fault that Putin
      invaded Ukraine and this horrible war that’s going on.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      No, this is a way of saying… The Republican message is he’s too old and feeble. Now, I mentioned the
      other day that they’re more than willing to give him credit, Trump is, for masterminding a vast
      conspiracy involving the Justice Department and prosecutors across the country to persecute Trump.
      So he can mastermind this whole elaborate conspiracy, but he can’t tie his own shoes. It’s like,
      choose a horse and ride it, brother.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Conspiracy theories do not have to be consistent. This is something we know from history, right? The
      Jews in charge of everything and they’re weak. I mean, it’s—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes. Yeah. No, you’re right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Two things, maybe, and then I’ll let you go. Let me do R.F.K second because that’s obviously out
      there. But when I was vice president cross chief of staff, and I’d been through this really before.
      I remember worrying a lot about some trip the next week somewhere. God knows what we were doing.
      Some senior person said to me, “Calm down. You should do a good job. Make sure the trip’s okay. But
      two things will matter for you as the vice president’s chief of staff of the vice president: his
      convention speech and the debate.” That was good advice because it put things in perspective, and
      you could have a lot of little things be slightly suboptimal. This trip to Green Bay didn’t go
      perfectly, whatever, but at the end of the day, the convention speech was drowned out by Buchanan so
      that was not so good. He did okay in the debate. But I’m curious about what you think about the
      convention. It seems to me those are the two known—what am I supposed to say—the two known unknowns
      we know are going to happen. Well, will there be debate? Should there be?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      No, there are no knowns, actually.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Isn’t that Democratic Convention in Chicago a little problematic here?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It is. Yeah, I’m worried about it. I’m worried about it. I think that we had a tumultuous convention
      here in ’68 and a very calm and peaceful one in ’96, and you worry that it would be more like the
      first than the second, particularly if the war is still raging. We haven’t talked at all about
      immigration. That’s the other thing that Biden has to move on. He can’t just rely on Trump—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, talk about that some more.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Well, I mean, look, I think the border issue, whatever you think of Abbott’s tactics, the border
      issue is now a national issue. In Chicago, it’s an issue that’s torn the city apart. It’s separated
      communities that might otherwise be aligned. Hispanic communities, Black communities. And the same
      is true in New York and Denver, and—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It could add to the chaos perception—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …on Gaza plus border, which are totally different things, of course, in the sense that Biden can’t
      quite control either.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes, that is it. I would not rely, if I were Biden’s people, too much on the fact that Trump killed
      the most significant border bill. I think he’s going to have to do something by executive order.
      Even if it’s challenged in the courts, he has to look like he’s seizing control of this situation.
      And then I think it makes the Republican obstructionism more effective, but that has to happen. The
      time is growing short. We’ve got a large migrant population, buses coming, many buses coming weekly
      from Texas, exacerbating it. And so I think the combination of protests over the war and tumult over
      migration and visible evidence of migrants, the diabolical mind would suggest that there’ll be
      migrant tents set up, and not necessarily by the city in visible places just to underscore the
      issue. Where that issue is by the convention is important. Where the war is by the convention is
      important. There’s been a tussle in the city about where these protesters can protest and that’ll be
      I think significant, but yeah, I’m worried about it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The convention will be an important marker. Just looking ahead six months basically, seven months,
      there’s the conventions, July and August. Then, there’s—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I mean the Republican thing is going to be interesting because it could be that you have a convicted
      felon for the first time in American history. That’ll be of interest. I’m not sure it’s going to
      move that many votes. Although you talk about these Haley voters, they have expressed in polling a
      strong opinion that they won’t support a candidate who’s been convicted of felonies. That may be the
      case by that convention. They’re going to have their own intrigue, but those concerns are the ones I
      had raised. Conventions are also an opportunity if you can handle those issues to tell the story
      that you want to tell. They had a brilliant convention in 2020 that was all or mostly virtual
      because of the pandemic, but they really branded Biden as a guy from Scranton who had good middle
      class values and sensibilities and economic values, who was a man of faith, who was a part of a
      military family. That was helpful.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      They used Republicans for Biden effectively. It was a lot of our people in the Republicans votes
      against Trump.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Exactly, it was probably as well conceived a convention as I’ve seen and I’ve been a part of some
      that I was proud of. They did a great job and hopefully they can do that again and not have the
      thing overwhelmed by protesters.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Is that an important moment you think, July, August, or are these days the conventions just come and
      go? I mean do you think that’s sort of a possible inflection point? It used to be ’88 Bush rallies
      at the convention, overtakes Dukakis. It doesn’t seem like it happens quite that way anymore, but do
      you still think there’s a—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      No, they’re TV shows now and they’re not watched as much as they used to be, but there’s still an
      opportunity for branding and to tell a story. I talked at the beginning about the fact that
      campaigns are about narratives. You should leave a convention knowing what that narrative is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      That’s the last chance really.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I think this is an opportunity to do that. The candidates get to make speeches and those speeches,
      while the audience may be smaller, still are significant. I mean conventions are important. We had
      some great old conventions in Chicago. We’ve had 25 at which real decisions were made and sometimes
      historic decisions. It’s not going to be that, but—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      FDR in ’32, Lincoln and FDR.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Taft and Roosevelt.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      When I was arguing for Biden should step aside and let’s have a fun competitive race. I really liked
      the idea of the Chicago convention replicating Lincoln and Lincoln in 1860 or FDR in ’32.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      It’s not going to happen.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Could also replicate 1968 of course, that was a bit of a problem.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What about debate? Should Biden debate?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      We had this discussion. You may have heard if you listen to that. We had this discussion and Plouffe
      was of the mind that he has to, that he needs it. I think that it’s probably wise to make that
      decision closer to the event because who knows what condition Trump is going to be in going into
      that convention? If you need it, you should do it. If he does it, how he does it and how he appears
      to people will be obviously very important. If he needs a debate, he needs a good debate. He needs a
      debate in which his performance seems vigorous and engaged. It’s almost as important as what he
      says. That’s what Rove’s point was in our discussion, but I’d make that decision later. His answer
      when he was asked this was, “Well, it depends on how he behaves,” which doesn’t exactly sound like a
      prescription for debating because if you’re going on the basis of Trump’s behavior, he disqualifies
      himself every day. It does hold open the decision and my guess is they will hold that decision open
      until they have to make it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      RFK Junior and other possible third, fourth, fifth parties? I mean serious problem, clear who he
      takes votes from or not? Can the campaigns arrange things, push things so that he takes votes more
      from the other candidate than from your own candidate?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yeah, I think first of all, general premise, Trump has always gotten around 46%, 47% of the vote.
      He’s never gotten to 50%. My view is that anything that lowers the threshold, in 2016 the combined
      third party candidates really helped him. Jill Stein of the Green Party who’s running again got more
      votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania than the margin by which Clinton beat Biden. I think
      in the main these third parties help Trump more than Biden. Kennedy is an interesting case because
      he’s polling around 9% now nationally and in these states. Some of it is the name and nostalgia for
      the name and some of it is his anti-corporate populism that attracts some potential democratic
      voters, younger voters. Some of it is conspiracy theory, vaccination stuff that attracts Trump
      voters. I think that the goal for the Biden campaign and Democrats has to be to leave him only with
      that group of voters who share the conspiracy theories and who identify more readily with Trump than
      not. I would target voters on social and in direct communications who are more apt to be for Biden
      or potential for Biden, but who find Kennedy appealing. I would try and peel them away and leave the
      rest for Trump. Leave the rest Trump voters with Kennedy.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Maybe push some of the Trump voters to Kennedy. I always love the way these discussions are sort of
      silly sometimes because it’s sort of who’s voting for Kennedy? What’s the split of Biden and Trump
      supporters as if people don’t have agency and the ability to push one message or another about
      Kennedy?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Well, I think—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The group could put up, I’m just making this up, $50 million of ads showing Trump with Fauci, Trump
      boasting about how he’s going to vaccinate everyone, which he did some of obviously in 2020,
      defending his own fast tracking of the vaccine. It’s probably one of the decent things he did as
      president and say, “Look, Trump’s not really against vaccines. Only Kennedy is.” Now obviously that
      would be a somewhat dirty, not really dirty trick, but—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      No, it’s not. It’s true.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s true. I mean if 3% of Trump supporters say, “Oh my God, I didn’t realize he was such a vaccine
      guy. I am for Kennedy,” why isn’t that a good idea?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      The danger of course if you do that, you have to be really careful with that because you could also
      normalize him for people who are on the fence and say, “Well.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      You also could… to a general group sort of find those points of similarity rather than differences
      between Kennedy and Trump and drive people who are anti Trump away from him. I think there are a lot
      of strategies that can be employed, but I think they need a special strategy. I think they know this
      to deal with Kennedy because he’s not an idle threat here. He’s not a threat to be president, but
      he’s a threat to tip this race one way or another.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Very much so, I just think you have a case where two-thirds of the country has said they don’t want
      either Biden or Trump. They prefer not to have Biden or Trump. Let’s be fair. There’s too much
      possibility for third- and fourth-party candidates to get votes even if they—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      As we’ve seen, as we’ve seen, I mean Trump was president because of it. That is the exact scenario
      that elected him in 2016.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I’ll let you go, but anything we should look for in the next few? I mean in your campaign I think
      the conventional view was, and I think you thought this was right and you planned it this way, that
      you could do a lot of damage to Romney and set up the contrast early.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      In the spring.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We’re not that early now, but we are in this kind of spring/summer period before the conventions.
      Conventional view is often save it all for the last two months, but how important are the next two,
      three months?
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I think they are important. First of all, I think what happens in the fall is that there’s such
      saturation coverage in all different mediums that paid media is less effective than it is earlier. I
      would expect both the Biden campaign and the Biden super PAC or super PACs to be very active in the
      spring and really push some of these comparative arguments and try and knock Trump down a few
      points. I think this is the time. I don’t think you want to wait to do that in the fall. I think
      intuitively people think that to talk to people when they’re paying attention. Yes, you’ve got to do
      some of that, but this is a time when you can cement a negative narrative when they don’t have the
      air power to respond. I mean take advantage of the fact that Trump has resource issues right now and
      press your advantage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s very interesting. It’s three months until July 4th. That’s been my instinct. I mean if Biden
      could pick up two, three, four points and be a bit ahead by July 4th, that’s a very different world
      than if he’s had this little bump, but it subsides and Trump is plus two, three, four on July 4th
      don’t you think? I just feel like—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      We also, Bill, have no idea what all these cases, I mean he’s going to be tried in New York. That
      seems pretty clear. We’re waiting on a Supreme Court decision and we could get a trial later in the
      year in Washington on the January 6th case. I mean I’m dubious about that. I mean I’m dubious about
      whether they’re going to ultimately hold a trial that ends in October.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      The Trump people are delay, delay, delay on all of this, but this is a weird campaign because a lot
      of it is going to happen in the traditional places. A lot of it’s going to happen in courthouses,
      and you talk about unknown unknowns. Those are the greatest probably.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It is striking, isn’t it? To the most recent president or the current president, 99.9% name ID so
      far in the last year pretty small fluctuations I would say in the polls—-
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Yes, it’s also because we’re so tribal.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We’re very tribal and polarized. On the one hand, one’s instinct is to say, “This is what it is.
      It’s kind of stable, but very much on the margin.” Then, you look at all the things that are so
      unusual and so crazy, 77 year old and 81 year old, legal cases—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Two incumbents.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …Dissatisfaction with both nominees, the world and a fair amount of chaos and could be much better,
      could be much worse. I sort of think, I don’t know, it might be the opposite of stable and
      predictable.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Anybody who makes forecasts—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I feel like it’s both things can’t be true, that it’s stable and predictable and totally unstable
      and unpredictable. I don’t know.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Forecasts are for fools right here. I mean I think you can maybe say who would win today. I think
      anybody who says they know who’s going to win in November is foolish because there are too many
      imponderables. We mentioned the trials with Trump. Obviously, we’re relying on the notion that Biden
      is going to be hale and hearty from now until November. A slip and fall or something like that could
      have an impact. There are a lot of variables here. The one thing I think you can predict is it’s
      going to be close one way or the other. Beyond that, I would not venture.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We’ll get back together maybe after the conventions or maybe—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I’m not sure a lot of what I said makes sense.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no, it makes sense.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      You’re not recording this, are you? I don’t want to be held accountable.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, what’s good these days with the internet and all that—
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      I always love talking with you.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Nothing lasts forever. No one could ever go back and look at all the things you said a few months
      ago. It just disappears into the ether.
  - speaker: David Axelrod
    text: |
      Listen, this is a bit of Trump’s nightmare, right? Video tape, because in Trump’s world every day is
      a new day, what you said in the past doesn’t matter. He does as witnessed by this ad that Biden’s
      running with the tape of Trump bragging about ending Roe versus Wade. I mean tough to erase that
      stuff. Anyway, great to be with you as always.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      David, thank you. Really thanks a lot for this very insightful and thought provoking conversation.
