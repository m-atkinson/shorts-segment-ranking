      Hi. I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again by Anne
      Applebaum. We had a conversation almost exactly a year ago, right? I think it was the day before the
      war began. We assumed Putin would invade, and actually your comments from the time, your analysis
      stands up very well, in terms of Putin’s motives, and the way he would conduct the war, in terms of
      Ukraine, a little bit on Europe. So, I want to go back over all of that. But just to reintroduce
      Anne, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian, must-read writer for The Atlantic , not just on Ukraine
      and Russia, but focusing on that, obviously, in the last year. Twilight of Democracy , an excellent
      book written a couple of years ago. And I guess maybe you’re best known for the books on the Soviet
      Union, on the Gulag history, and on Stalin’s War on Ukraine. And those are all terrific books. So, a
      rare combination of historical depth and crisp commentary on current events. So, Anne, thanks for
      joining me again.

      So, let’s go right to it, and let’s just talk about, you know so much about Ukraine, Russia. I feel
      like some of the conversation about the war, understandably, and I engage in this too, is very
      general, autocracy, democracy, which is fine and important. But let’s talk about the actual country.
      So, it’s a year in. So, what have you learned? What surprised you? What should we all know about?
      Let’s just begin with Ukraine. Let’s begin with the uplifting side, rather than Putin’s Russia. So,
      what about Ukraine?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      So, the Ukrainians have surpassed all expectations. I mean, if you look back to what people were
      saying a year from now, I was part of a lot of conversations in Washington and elsewhere, in which
      the fall of Kyiv was widely anticipated. The assumption was that, okay, there would be a guerilla
      war and the fighting would go on for a long time, maybe even many years, but the Ukrainian state was
      very unlikely to survive. I did think that this was a wrong assumption at the time, and I’m
      fortunate enough to have said so publicly in a couple of places.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s good.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      But of course, we all had doubts. Nobody really knew, because we didn’t quite know what the scale of
      the attack would be. But I think what has happened is that the Ukrainians have shown, first of all,
      that their army and their military were far better prepared, kind of psychologically, and in terms
      of planning and so on, than anybody had guessed. I mean, the country didn’t do something, so they
      didn’t produce lots of ammunition in advance. They didn’t reinforce their cities in advance. There
      were things in retrospect that could have been done, and if you go around Ukraine, you hear people
      say that. And it would have been nice to have wider, broader social preparation, but the army was
      prepared. And the army has also shown itself to be very creative. It uses what equipment it has,
      whether it’s drones you can buy on the internet, and they call it “MacGyvering.” Fixing them up to
      be able to do other things they weren’t supposed to be able to do. They’re extremely creative. They
      use their weapons well. There is no hint, by the way, of any corruption to do with the army. All
      that is very straightforward. And the other thing that has been, again, not surprising if you knew
      Ukraine, but really, by comparison to other societies in other times and places, Ukrainian society,
      the way in which spontaneous volunteer groups have organized themselves, whether to help the army,
      or to help refugees, or to run cities in the absence of… I’ve got a story coming out today about
      cities and towns under occupation, people really rising to the challenge in extraordinary ways. It’s
      always been a kind of grassroots society. It’s better ground-up. The state was always much weaker
      than the society, and it was always a place where people were suspicious of power, but able to
      organize on the ground. And all of that has played out just unbelievably well. I was in Ukraine last
      summer. I’ve been several times, three times actually, since the war began. And I spent a few days
      in Odessa, and just the range of people, and groups, and organizations who are creatively seeking to
      help the war effort is astonishing. And I think Ukrainians deserve an enormous amount of credit for
      that. I mean, again, when people write the history of the war, and when they look back, they will
      talk about some of the lack of preparation. They will talk about some weaknesses in Zelensky’s
      government. There are things people don’t like, and I even wonder whether he’ll be reelected, even
      assuming they win. I can imagine a Churchill situation in which people say, “Right now, we want
      something else.” But he has also surpassed expectations as well. People said, “He’s an actor. He’s a
      comedian. What does he know about wars?” But it turns out he’s not only that, he’s also a television
      producer. Everybody around him is a television producer.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      They think a lot about how to send a message, how to galvanize people at home, how to speak to
      people abroad. And he is, of course, one of the great discoveries of the war.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. No. I mean, you mentioned Churchill. I do feel like in our lifetime, this is the closest we’ve
      seen to a sort of Britain 1940 situation, both in terms of leadership and in terms of the public
      behaving with really impressive and admirable courage and determination, but also calmness and
      resolution. And it’s really something to see. And a year ago when we talked, you said that people
      had underestimated the sort of democratic and liberal development, and development of civil society
      in Ukraine, especially from 2014 on. But say a word about that. I guess I had this sort of rather
      conventional view that, I mean, obviously god knows I wish them well, and was all for helping them
      as much as we could. But I also had read about the corruption, and the problems, and the oligarchs,
      all the election. The hopes of 2014 having been dashed in some respect. But that was a deeper
      transformation than I think I realized.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      One of the things that people didn’t realize about… Two things I think are important. One is how
      young the Zelensky team is. I mean, this is a country run now by people in their thirties and
      forties. And that’s very important in the Ukrainian context, because that means those are all people
      who aren’t connected to the old Soviet system, and don’t even really remember it. And in a lot of
      cases, it also means they’re not even really connected to the sort of oligarchic system that ran the
      country in the nineties and most of the first part of the 2000s. So there was a kind of generational
      change. And the other thing that turned out to be important was, Ukraine has pretty active local
      democracy, so kind of local mayors, and locally elected politicians are authentic. I mean, they’re
      not appointed by somebody. These elections aren’t fake. They’re real people. And that also turned
      out to matter a lot. So local mayors in occupied zones were able to do things for people and help
      them, and they felt an obligation to them, and they had actual real authority because they were
      elected, and all of that turned out to matter a lot. And then, as I said, Zelensky’s ability to
      communicate was another piece of the story. Every night now he does a national broadcast. It’s very
      short. It’s five minutes. He does it on his cell phone. And so, no production values, no lighting,
      no TV studio, just his little phone, and he speaks into the phone. And of course, speaking to the
      phone, and by the way, the way he’s dressed, he’s dressed as a member of the Ukrainian Territorial
      Army. So, like an average soldier. Not like a general. And all of that is, on the one hand, staged,
      in that they think about it. “We want to look authentic.” And he wants to look like a normal person.
      “I’m a normal person who’s accidentally found himself in this extraordinary situation.” And the only
      other thing, it works because it’s true. So, it’s not just fake authenticity. It’s real. I mean, he
      really is a normal person who found himself in this situation. And so what that means is that lots
      of people identify. So ordinary people who are in the Territorial Army, or they’re helping out even
      not at the frontline, but helping with food distribution or something, they can all empathize with
      him, and he’s speaking to them. And that turned out to be an aspect of his presidency and of the
      society that was probably much stronger than anyone expected.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s such an amazing demonstration of democratic, small D, leadership. To speak to the people
      every night, and I guess pretty candidly give them updates, and acknowledge that there’s been
      terrible things have happened, and there have been some places that things haven’t gone quite as
      well as they hoped.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah. And they’ve made some mistakes. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. I mean, that’s a pretty… So say a word about that. I mean, I’m really struck by that the depth
      of liberalism, or democratic values, or both, I suppose, in Ukraine, obviously side by side with a
      very deep nationalism and a defense of their country. The Fatherland, the Motherland. But again,
      reminds me of 1940 and the degree to which Churchill both, you read those speeches, appeals to, of
      course, the great history of Britain, and, “This could be our finest hour,” and so forth, but also
      very explicitly that, “We are the defense of freedom. Without us, we are looking at a new dark age,”
      and so forth. And I feel like that, again, a very unusual moment to see those two come together so
      dramatically.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      So, in my view, this is why Zelensky has been so successful around the world, and why he has such a
      deep appeal, is if you think of our culture war as … Okay, this is very, very crude. On the one
      hand, liberal values. But on the other hand, nationalism, or patriotism, or whatever you want to
      call it. What he does is a patriotic, nationalistic defense of liberal values. And that’s why he can
      appeal to a wide part of the political spectrum, not just in the US, but all across Europe, because
      people can identify with that. And it’s a thing that people have felt to be missing. And I think
      that’s the source of it. And again, it also works because it’s true. His government and his
      administration is not ethnically Ukrainian, and doesn’t have an attachment to ethnic nationalism.
      They were elected as a representative of civic patriotism. Nobody ever uses that kind of language in
      Ukraine, but that’s in effect what he stood for, and so it’s real.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s so interesting and inspiring, really. I mean, anything else? You’ve been there three
      times since the war began. You talk to people there all the time. You read so much more than the
      rest of us do from Ukraine itself. Anything else you would want people here who aren’t following it
      nearly as closely should know? I mean, you feel pretty good about the general, the strength of civil
      society, so to speak, the strength of liberal and democratic values there. Wars put pressure, often,
      on those things.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah. I feel strongly about those things. I feel one aspect of the story that hasn’t been fully
      understood, and I just wrote this today, in fact. I haven’t even had time to look. It should be up
      on The Atlantic website within a few minutes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Today is February 14, for those who will be watching this a little later, but yeah.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      By the time you hear it, it’ll definitely be online. I’ve written, together with a Ukrainian
      journalist and some of her colleagues, a piece about what happened in the occupied territories. And
      we can write this now, because some of them have been liberated. And maybe this leads us to the
      government of Russia, but I think that the nature of what has happened there, the arrests, the
      torture… In every single liberated town, there’s a torture chamber. In every single liberated town,
      children are missing. The rounding up of children, separating them from their parents, sending them
      to Russia. The arrests of small town mayors and local counselors, the kinds of people we were just
      talking about. The arrests of volunteers, people who organize these volunteer organizations. The
      nature of the occupation is horrific and cruel in a way that we’ve genuinely not seen in Europe
      since 1945. And of course, for me, actually, 1945 might even be the wrong year to use, because for
      me, what it reminds me the most of is what the Red Army did when it occupied Central Europe in ’44,
      ’45, ’46, ’47. It’s the same kind of, “Decapitate society. Do mass arrests. Send people to prison,
      and try and reshape the society.” And the level of cruelty and violence that is being used there, I
      mean, forget the war zones. I’m not even talking about places where people are being bombarded. And
      the pictures you see on TV are mostly war zones. What you aren’t seeing is what’s happening in
      occupied Ukraine. And it’s important to understand that, because when we start talking about how the
      war is going to end, and whether the Ukrainians can trade territory away or not, and maybe they can,
      and we can talk about that in a minute if you want. The issue isn’t the territory or the land. The
      issue is what has happened to people in those places, and what is going on now. Everybody in Ukraine
      knows this, but I don’t know that the outside world understands this story. We are talking about
      concentration camps, mass murder, torture, arrests, torment of children, all inflicted on these
      zones of occupation. And the level of the crime and the knowledge of it is, I think, only just
      beginning right now to seep out of Ukraine.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And for that reason, just to, I think, dot your I and cross your T on this, I mean, the notion
      of a compromise, land for peace and all that, it’s not land for peace, right? It’s Ukrainian people
      for alleged peace.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      It’s Ukrainian people.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And then being treated in this barbaric way. I mean, we’re going to have UN observers in there
      making sure that it’s a decent situation, and the whatever places, if there are some, that Ukraine
      doesn’t get back. Well, what about Russia? I mean, you’ve written so much about it, and you of all
      people probably aren’t surprised in a way that this is what Putin’s Russia has come to, or were you
      surprised? Are you surprised?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Surprise is the wrong word. I mean, I did know what kind of a society it was. I suppose the surprise
      has been in the… Well, again, is that really surprising? I was about to say the lack of reaction at
      the highest levels of society. So, one of the functions of Russian propaganda, and one of the ways
      it works inside the country is that it’s designed to make people apathetic. So, Russians don’t have
      public opinion in the way we think of it. They don’t have views like, “I’m right wing,” or “I’m left
      wing.” Or “I think this” or “I think that” and “I can engage in a public argument with someone on
      social media about it.” It doesn’t work like that. There’s an official view, and if you want to keep
      your job, you stick to the view. But even privately, you don’t go there, mostly. Some percentage of
      the country does, but mostly, politics is a faraway dirty world that you want nothing to do with.
      You don’t want to talk about it. You don’t want to be involved in it, because it’s just dangerous
      and nasty. And so, the prediction that the public would be apathetic or distanced or not
      participating in the war, it works both ways, I should say. There’s no mass protest movement against
      the war. On the other hand, there’s also no pro-war movement either. And so, you don’t see people
      marching in the street calling for war. They do these really staged kind of TV demonstrations
      sometimes and they put these horrible propagandists on TV. But there’s no evidence inside Russia
      that people are excited or enthusiastic about it, on the contrary. Think of hundreds of thousands of
      people that have left. People stay home. They don’t participate. They don’t want to talk about it or
      hear about it. I’m surprised that at the higher levels of society, so the upper levels of the
      security services, maybe the business community, that there hasn’t been a little bit more signs of
      breaking. There are weird things that happen. I actually just read about a strange suicide of a high
      ranking Russian official in the last couple of days. And there are these business people and others
      who fall out of windows. And I assume that’s all signs of things, some kind of internal dissent. But
      I’m surprised it’s lasted this long and given how badly it’s gone, because there’s no hiding the
      fact that given the expectations inside Russia and outside Russia of the state of the Russian Army,
      which was thought to have been renewed and reformed and rebuilt and expanded and so on, and was
      supposed to be in such good shape, the catastrophic behavior of Russian soldiers has to have… People
      have clearly have noticed.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And I’m surprised there hasn’t been a little bit more elite objection to the war on those grounds.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And Putin just continues to go ahead, in your view? He’s been all-in, and all-in time and time
      again, so to speak. He could have maybe early on sort of tried to snatch a little territory and say
      that was enough and he made his point. But of course, as you said a year ago when we talked, that
      isn’t his point, right? His point is to destroy Ukraine as a viable nation—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No, no. It’s really—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …and a democracy, liberal democracy.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s really not his point. So, his point is, and he’s still saying, by the way, and the TV
      propagandists are still saying, “Our goal is to destroy Kyiv and make Ukraine into a puppet state.”
      So this is one of biggest problems I have with the sort of chorus of people who say, “We need to
      trade land for peace,” or “We need to negotiate.” Okay, great. Let’s negotiate. Now explain to me,
      how are you going to get Putin to give up on his main goal, which is the conquest of Kyiv? Because
      until he does that, what are we negotiating about? And we’re negotiating about a cease— Okay, we can
      have a ceasefire. We could stop fighting for six months. Meanwhile, he rebuilds his army, he gets
      some more weapons from Iran, and then he rebuilds the army and starts again. So, do you want to have
      another war next year or in two years? None of these are… This isn’t a reasonable way to end the
      war. And there’s kind of bogus even, “Oh, for Ukraine’s sake. Ukraine’s country is being destroyed.”
      That’s all true. But what option does Ukraine have? Stopping the fighting means that the country is
      occupied in the ways we’ve just described. So, all leaders will be dead, and all of the children
      will be deported and the country will be destroyed if it’s occupied. So, the Russians aren’t giving
      them a choice. And so, of course, they have to fight back. It’s pretty clear that something is going
      on in Russia that’s negative. There is some visible fighting in the security services in the Army.
      There are some kind of power struggles happening. As I said, I’m surprised it’s not more and not
      more vocal, but it’s not as if no one has noticed that the war isn’t going well. Like I said, for
      the moment, Putin appears not to have given up on his main goals. And therefore, the point of our
      continuing to support Ukraine and the point of Ukraine fighting should be to continue to fight until
      there is some kind of change in Russia. And I’m not going to tell you what that is. I don’t know
      whether it’s replacing Putin or whether Putin himself changes or whether something else happens. But
      Russia has to get to the stage that France was when it decided it no longer wanted to be a colonial
      power in Algeria, or that Britain did in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century, that, “Okay,
      this is not part of our country anymore.” So, they need to overcome that imperial, whatever it is,
      the imperial instinct and give up. And that does happen. We know it has happened. We can see it at
      other moments in history. In the case of Russia, as I think, as you say I said a year ago, I hope
      that’s what I said a year ago. In the case of Russia, there is an additional ideological element,
      which is that Putin feels that Ukraine represents not just a territory or a colonial part of Russia,
      but also that it has a political culture that scares him. He’s afraid of Ukrainian democracy and
      this civic patriotism that we’ve just been talking about, because it could inspire Russians. But
      something has to happen. They have to give that up. They have to understand that the war was a
      mistake. And that’s the moment when we can actually negotiate and the war can end.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And in the meantime, Ukraine has to fight and take back as much territory as possible, right?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah. And it’s through taking back territory and through winning the war that we will get to a
      moment where negotiation is possible, and we have not reached that yet. And anybody who comes up
      with a formula now, I’m almost sick of being asked this. This week, in the run-up to the
      anniversary, I’ve been asked many times, “When will the war end?” The war will end when it’s over.
      It will end when the Ukrainians win. If the Ukrainians don’t win, it won’t end, ever. So maybe a
      Russian-occupied Ukraine would bring Russian troops to the border with Poland. It would create a new
      threat to Poland, maybe even to Germany, certainly to the Baltic States. So, if you want the war to
      end and you want this particular security challenge to Europe to be over, we have to win.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And okay, let’s talk about Europe since you spent a lot of time there and you’re going to Munich
      later this week for that Security Conference. I had been there a few weeks ago, and I’m going again
      to try to talk to Germans and others, Poles, Ukrainians, Balts, Fins, Swedes. I think the
      conventional view, which I guess I agree with, is Europe has been better, so to speak, stronger,
      more resolute, more willing to adjust to a new reality than one might have thought 14 months ago,
      certainly, when the elites were mostly invested in a vision of trading with Russia and so forth. And
      one forgets how recently they had reaffirmed their commitment to Nord Stream. And so, you couldn’t
      say the kinds of things, you couldn’t talk about Russia in a serious way, frankly, in an honest way,
      I would almost say, in some of these countries, at least, not in all of them. So, I don’t know. Walk
      us, maybe begin with Germany, that’s the biggest actor, I don’t know, biggest, but maybe not the
      most decisive actor at this point. So anyway, talk about that.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Germany, I feel, since we don’t have to do sound bites here, I think it’s very important to be
      nuanced. Okay? So, Germany, on the one hand, has genuinely overcome decades of a dedication to
      pacifism and a horror of any kind of involvement in a European war. And Chancellor Scholz, at the
      very beginning of the war, sort of three or four days into the war, made a really remarkable speech
      in which he talked about a turning point. You know— “This is a new moment in history. We need to
      think completely differently. We need to have a different kind of army. Germany has no army. And we
      need to behave differently.” After that, it got more complicated, and the Germans didn’t really
      change their army as much as they said they were going to. And they became very nervous about what
      kind of weapons they were going to give to Ukraine. The Germans are very paranoid of being attacked
      themselves. They are directly in… You know that Russia owns a territory called Kaliningrad.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Which is a little piece of the Baltic, sort of up on the Baltic Sea. And there are thought to be
      tactical nuclear weapons there, which could hit Berlin. So just so that know, that’s in the back of
      their minds. And they do think about that, and they’re aware of it, too. So, you get this kind of
      schizophrenic back and forth, where they can sound good and then they don’t come up with the goods.
      More recently, they have become, they are I think now the third largest donor of weapons if you look
      at value to Ukraine. They are an enormous donor of funding. Some of it goes through the EU rather
      than directly. They’re one of the largest places where refugees live. Actually, the refugees who
      were staying with me in Poland are now there. The debate inside Germany is very open. There are some
      very prominent advocates for helping Ukraine from the Green Party, from the Liberal Party. The
      Foreign Minister is very clear in her views. You can also hear the opposite view. You can hear pro-
      Russian voices on the far right in Germany, and there’s a little bit on the far left as well. But
      it’s a robust conversation. It’s really very much at the center of political debate, much more so, I
      think, than almost anywhere else in Europe.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s right.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And so, you can see there has been a transition and there has been a change. Maybe it hasn’t gone
      far enough yet, but we’re going the right direction.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      I was struck — Jeff Gedmin and I were there about three, four weeks ago — and again, to generalize
      from three days of private meetings, but we saw a lot, an awful lot of people. The way I came back,
      and I guess we wrote something, the Zeitenwende is real. The turning point is real. It’s hesitant.
      It’s a little bit two steps forward, one step back. It’s not in every part of society, but they’ve
      liberated from Russian energy. Some of the stuff beneath the surface, I think, especially in energy
      policy been pretty dramatic. And the general spirit seemed, to me, especially among younger
      politicians, to be very different from five years ago or one and a half years ago. They really have
      begun to assimilate that this is… We’re not going… One German politician got in trouble for saying
      this, “There’s going to be a new normal, whenever this war ends.” And she was sort of, “Oh no,
      that’s too dramatic.” But in fact, no one there thinks they can go back to the old normal, I think.
      And that is true.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No, no. Actually, the decision to cut off Russian gas supplies and to liberate themselves from that
      and really recreate their energy system in that period of time is extraordinary. Almost no other
      country could have done that. And there’s even some anger in Europe that the Germans put so much
      money into it and they were less helpful maybe to others who have also an energy crisis. But they
      did it, and it’s a pretty spectacular change. And remember this is a change not just from the past
      few years, but the German dependence on Russian energy goes back to the 1970s, you know?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      So, it’s a very, very old relationship. And ripping that up is a… Destroys a lot of assumptions
      about German industry and so on. There has been a, in that sense, a pretty big change.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Someone I was talking to — a German — yesterday who said he thought one thing the Germans have part
      way down the road to thinking through, but not really is the relationship with their neighbors and
      the allies that, I mean, Germany is used to being with France, the engine of Europe, and there are
      these other little countries that come along and help out or don’t help out, or they bully them to
      do things, or they save them from themselves in the case of the southern European countries. And to
      be fair, they have done, from a certain point of view, it’s pretty amazing what Germany has pulled
      off with the European project in the EU. But I do think they’re only a little bit down the road in
      thinking through the relationship with Poland, with Ukraine itself and the future, with the Balts,
      the Nordics. And one thing we were encouraged to do, which just give you a concrete example there,
      was to bring a lot more people from those countries into these small meetings we’re doing in Berlin,
      because even though they talk, of course, at the government to government level all the time, and to
      some degree at the think tank to think tank levels sort of, A, they end up squabbling about various
      things, reparations in the case of Poland.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      There’s—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And do you feel that’s the case? Talk a little bit about Poland, which you know very well, but also
      the Nordic and the Balts, and yeah.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      There is a huge problem, I mean, and the problem is Poland and very specific, and I’ll try not to
      talk about it too much. Poland should be right now, I don’t know already officially part of the
      triumvirate that runs Europe, Poland, Germany, France. Poland, that has also an enormous source of
      weapons training and other equipment going into Ukraine. All of the American weapons are coming
      through Poland and going through Ukraine. So that was a big effort. Poland, is the, I think it’s
      still the host of the largest number of refugees, but certainly it’s very large. At the beginning of
      the war, everybody in the country had refugees staying with them that I know, including me. And it’s
      been a big national effort and it’s very important. The trouble is Poland right now is run by an
      illiberal ruling party that sees as one of the pillars of its propaganda is how much they hate
      Germany. And they have almost no normal relationship with Germany. So they make Germany into an
      enemy. They accuse all of the opposition, including my, I should be clear, one of them is my
      husband, but certainly leaders of the opposition, they accuse them literally of being Germans.
      There’s a clip of one of— the main leader of the opposition, Donald Tusk, there’s a clip of him
      saying one fragment of a speech in German where he was saying a thank you to the, you know, he said,
      thank you for a conference and enjoy or goodbye, something, one sentence in German, and he uses the
      expression for Deutschland. And this little clip has been repeated nightly. They will show it on TV
      night after night after night and say, “He’s German.” And this is state TV is run, is now
      completely, you have to imagine kind of Breitbart TV, Breitbart takes over the BBC, and that’s what
      state television is. Very, very nasty They run smear campaigns. And so that’s made a relationship
      between Poland and Germany almost impossible. And I don’t think it’s the German’s fault, honestly.
      And Poland also has very poor relationships with almost everybody. The Czechs, difficult
      relationships with almost everybody in Europe. So, they’ve made a change in EU strategy difficult.
      Macron can’t stand them. He won’t be in the same room with them, the leaders of Poland. Every time
      they see each other, there’s some kind of scandal or somebody says something insulting. So they’ve
      made it difficult for this to be normal. And they’ve also, I think the Poles, this particular ruling
      party has done a lot of damage even to Ukraine. People look at Ukraine and they say, “Are they going
      to become another Poland? Are we going to have another headache like these people?” So that’s a kind
      of complicating factor that makes the sort of heroic Poles save Europe story, which I would like to
      be able to tell you, complicated, so just since, as I said, since we’re doing nuance here. There is
      an election in Poland in October. It’s going to be the ugliest election there has ever been. I hope
      it’s, I mean, it’s not going to be fair, but I hope it’s free. I mean, they’re going to try and use
      government money and state money in order to influence the outcome. It’s hard for me to see how
      they’re going to allow themselves to lose. They have taken over so much of the state and they have
      allocated so much state property and money to their own people and they’re not going to want to give
      that up, but we’ll see. It’s going to be ugly, that’s [inaudible].
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s so interesting and important to— sorry.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      It’s already started, actually, so it’s—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s right. Yeah. No, I was struck just, again, knowing so much less, in Germany, they were
      griping about Poland. I had said to Jeff, who knows much more, “What are they, just like this is
      just ancient hostilities and the Poles—”
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No, it’s not.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But it’s not. And the Poles, I guess the degree to which it’s central in Polish politics now,
      demand—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      It’s central to Polish politics, and it is—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …reparations from Germany.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And one of the reasons, I should say one of the reasons it’s central to Polish politics is that the
      previous government, again, full disclosure, my husband was the foreign minister in the previous
      government, previous government was very close to Germany and there were a lot of Polish-German
      projects and there was an enormous amount of goodwill. And there was a series of meetings that there
      was a kind of Polish-German-French triangle. It was called the Weimar Triangle. So that was all
      happening, and this government decided to reverse that for, well, they think it’s good for them
      domestic politically. So it’s not just, it’s really not just some kind of ancient German problem
      with Poland. It’s a Poland has create deliberately created this difficulty.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, which—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And the Polish demand for reparations just so that you know, I mean, Germany has paid, depending on
      how you count and how you look at it, has paid reparations to Poland several times in the form of
      land, in the form of enormous EU subsidies. Also, there were payoffs of other kinds in the ’60s and
      ’70s. So it’s an issue that has been revived for Polish domestic political consumption, and it’s not
      real. And, I mean, it is real in that they talk about it, but it’s a very, it’s tendentious, and the
      Germans are right to ignore it. So it’s an unfortunate and sad piece of the story that I hope will
      eventually change. And I should say though, the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, the Czechs, the
      Slovaks, the Balts, the Nordics as well, as you say, have been huge contributors to the war and the
      war effort, and have been very united with Europe and with NATO as well. So that partly makes up for
      it. I mean, then, of course, the great exception is Hungary.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, really, sure, it’s a good reminder. I mean, Poland, they’re so anti-Russian, which saves
      the, in a way, saves us from some of the worst aspects that could happen if with a semi
      authoritarian, if that’s the right term, government. But it is a reminder that governments matter,
      authoritarianism matters, politics matters, right? I mean, it’s not an accident, as we say, that the
      polls, as you say, are causing much more trouble now and are really problematic. Whereas it’s the
      more, I can put it this way, liberal democratic regimes in the Balts and in the Nordic states where
      you see real leadership, and I’m really struck by that. I mean, the degree to which 35 and 45 year
      old prime ministers of Estonia and Finland and so forth are articulating a vision for liberal
      democracy in Europe, a European vision, but also a transatlantic vision, a very liberal democratic
      vision in the best sense is really striking to me. I mean, that was not something I saw coming, but
      it’s terrific, I think.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No, no, I mean, it is partly because those countries, the Nordics feel very much, they look at the
      map and there’s the Baltic Sea and there’s Russia, and the Russians have gone out of their way to
      intimidate them, and they do these games where they fly planes over their territory and so on. And
      they’ve worked it out that their security is also under threat. And so there’s an enormous amount of
      Nordic Baltic solidarity, which is great. And there is also generational change there too, in that a
      previous generation that was wedded to a vision of Russia integrated and our main trading partner
      now sees that that was an illusion, that sadly, I should say that was an illusion. And that the
      nature of the Russian state does matter, and being safe against it is going to require an alliance.
      You’re not going to be able to do it by yourself as Finland, or by yourself as Denmark.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I’m really, maybe I’m just kidding myself, but I am struck that if you think about the 21st
      century in a very big way and stuff, Europe, which I guess would’ve sort of said 20 years ago is
      okay, it’s fine, it’s a liberal democratic place, a decent place, but would not be much of a engine
      for defending and strengthening liberal democracy around the world, or even in the region. As you
      say, they were pretty acquiescent to what was going on in Russia and not terribly interested in
      taking them on at different times. I really feel that Europe could be much more of a partner with
      the US than I would’ve thought, especially if they could work out a few things there in Poland, and
      then there’s the Hungary question, but if Poland and Ukraine would be huge, are big countries.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yes, Poland with a pro-European government that was dedicated to some kind of deep relationship with
      Ukrainian democracy would be a huge powerhouse ally.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And Ukraine too itself, right? That’s a big country.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And Ukraine itself. Ukraine, I mean, everything depends on how the war ends and when it ends and so
      on, so I’m not going to make predictions, but if, following a victory, Ukraine would be one of the
      most creative, open societies in Europe. They would’ve just won a huge war. They’ve shown themselves
      in all kinds of areas, cyber, military, technology, ingenious and inventive, and they’re literally
      creating new ways to fight and new ways to think about self-defense. They’re going to be a really
      interesting place to invest and an interesting place to be connected to. As I said, much depends on
      how the war ends and when, but I hope that it is the case.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, so much depends on the actual outcome of the war and one can’t overlook that, right? Sort of
      mad.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah, of course. Of course.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean, there’s a way in which all these social sciences sites, “Well, the war, that’s just a weird
      variable, but we’re going to talk about these deeper forces.” but the war matters. What about the
      US? I mean, when we talked, it was a little … Biden had done a very good job, I thought, we all
      thought in the run-up to the war in terms of making, you know, explaining what Putin was going to do
      and being quite forward leaning on that. But it was unclear, I think two months after the, well, not
      two months, six months after the Afghanistan withdrawal and so forth, where the Biden administration
      would be and where the US public would be for that matter. What’s your one year in judgment on that?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      So, I am really grateful that Biden was president during this last year and that he had enough of a,
      I don’t know whether it was kind of Cold War muscle memory or whether it was personal dedication to
      the idea that US and European security are linked, or whether it was his long experience of
      traveling back and forth to that region. He did step up to the plate. He did make it clear that we
      would help Ukraine. And I think they too, at the beginning, were, they were not sure what would
      happen. And as you remember, the first couple of days in the war, they offered Zelensky a ride out.
      I think they imagined what they were going to be doing was helping the Ukrainians in exile
      somewhere, in Poland or somewhere, fight a guerilla war, and this obviously turned into something on
      a different scale. I mean, having said that, there have been moments when I wished the
      administration would move faster. There is a lot of, Biden has made it clear that he doesn’t want
      any Americans fighting there and he doesn’t want any NATO troops fighting there. And there is a
      paranoia about what will the Russians do? Will they react to this weapon or that weapon? What can we
      give the Ukrainians? And I have worried and continue to worry that the Ukrainians aren’t always
      being given what they need to win in time to use it. And since the decision about the tanks, for
      example, that was taken a few weeks ago, that was late. Couldn’t we have made that decision a few
      months earlier so that the Ukrainians were training on the tanks, and they could have already been
      in the field by now? And we seem to be kind of several beats behind almost every time. But
      nevertheless, I have to say that I was in the Pentagon not that long ago and I was told by senior
      people there, “Look, this is the main thing that we think about right now.” So they spend a lot of
      time on it. They do think about it. It’s a big operation. I don’t think there’s anything comparable.
      I’ve asked a couple of historians, no one can think of anything. Maybe Lend-Lease during the second
      World War, but I don’t think there’s a comparable moment when the US, in particular, has helped
      another country fight war in this way, at this scale. So, again, as I was with Germany, I’ll be
      nuanced with the US. It’s a huge effort. It’s amazing. It’s incredible. I wish it was moving even
      faster, but there we are.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, it is… People, I am also struck when I talk to people who are pretty close to the actual
      war effort, the weapons and so forth, people in Europe, I mean, how much we’re doing. We’re probably
      doing a little more than we get credit for in some ways, and maybe that’s good because you don’t
      want to make it look like a big US operation, so… And one—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No, and we’re helping them with intelligence. We’re helping them in all, as we know, in all kinds of
      ways. And they know it and are grateful for it. So sometimes they sound a little whiny because the
      Ukrainians are always asking for more. That’s what they have to do. But they do know it, and there
      is an immense amount of gratitude. And the Europeans know it as well. Actually, the US effort has
      been pretty inspiring for others. You asked me actually about support inside the US. I’ve actually
      seen some polling recently. And as you know, there is a part of the Republican Party and there’s a
      part of the Republican media that’s become very anti-Ukrainian and very pro-Russian. Some of it is
      expressed in this Russian language about the Ukrainians are going to start World War III, that Elon
      Musk has been using. And some of it is about, oh, they’re corrupt and they’re taking our money.
      Whatever the sources of that, and there may be different… It does have an impact, and there is kind
      of 30% of the population that doesn’t fully support the war, maybe is even against it. One of my
      worries is that one of the interesting things about the polling, if you track it over time, is that
      American support for the war goes up when it seems like the Ukrainians are winning. So last fall, in
      September, when there was this huge take back of territory, the support went up. And as the war goes
      on a long time and as it becomes more of a quagmire, support falls. Of course, it’s the opposite of
      what should be the case. But I’m just telling you what human psychology is. And so a lot depends… I
      think US support and the future of that will depend a lot on what happens over the spring and summer
      and whether Ukrainians are able to take back territory and begin to make progress again, because I
      think Americans like the idea of supporting Ukraine, 70% of Americans, but we’ll get… I should make
      with one caveat, which is that in this country, I don’t think people directly connect domestic
      economic problems to the war in the way that they do in Europe.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      In Europe, clear connection between energy prices and the war, for example, because they use Russian
      gas. And we don’t. The US doesn’t have a direct dependence on Russia for anything. And so I don’t
      know that we are affected economically by the war in quite the same way. And so for us, it’s more
      about do you support the idea of democracy? Do you care about American influence abroad? Do you want
      to help Zelensky? The questions are a little bit different. In Europe, there are some hard economic
      questions. People say, “We want the war over because we want gas prices to go down.” Here we don’t
      have that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s so much more present. I was struck by that when I was in Berlin, and I’m going to be in Prague
      a couple of weeks. The war in general, it’s just close by and there are a lot of Ukrainians. Germany
      has a million refugees. Maybe Poland has, I don’t know, three million, maybe two and a half million.
      I’ve seen different numbers. Everyone knows someone who’s hosting them or talking to them and they
      know people from Kyiv in any place, because since 2014 there’s been so much travel back and forth. I
      think wasn’t Ukraine sort of… became a visa-free travel zone for Europe at that point. So for us,
      it’s impressive that we’re doing as much as we are, given that we have so little direct connection
      in a certain way, right?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Now, people can say, “Well, it’s easy for us. There’s no troops, obviously, and no real risk to the
      US, and we’re just spending a lot of money,” which— fine. And that’s also, I guess, would be a fair
      qualification of the praise for the US. But for all the people who say, “Oh, the US. The public’s so
      isolationist. They don’t understand anything about the world. Especially after Iraq and Afghanistan,
      they’ll never be willing to understand that the fate of other nations far away matters to us.” That
      seems not to be the case, I would say.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No. It seems not to be the case. And I think people understand the nature of the war. And as I said,
      Zelensky’s appeal to both sides of the political spectrum is real. And people understand that it was
      an unprovoked invasion, and those who’ve read enough into it to understand, as I said, what’s
      happening on those occupied territories, understand why it is that we need to help the Ukrainians.
      Remember, what the Russians are doing is not only attacking Ukraine. This isn’t just about Ukraine.
      They’re also attacking a whole set of ideas and principles and norms. They’re attacking the idea of
      human rights. They’re attacking the idea of laws of war. They’re attacking the UN convention on
      genocide. What they’re attempting to do is show that all of these things that were part of the
      world, the US helped build after 1945 and 1989, they’re trying to show that all of it’s bullshit.
      They’re trying to undermine all of that. And I think there are a lot of people who intuitively
      understand that. And Putin, not a terribly sympathetic figure for most people, and the Ukrainians
      have continued that. I know this for a fact, because I talked to them. They spent a lot of time
      thinking about how to reach Americans, how to talk to Americans. And to some extent, they have
      success. And I think Americans are responding to that sense of, “Do we want all this to be
      destroyed? Do we want to turn the clock back and make genocide easy again?” And I think most people
      don’t.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. No. I very much agree with that. Some of my friends think President Biden could do much more
      to explain this and others could in the administration. And that might be true. It might also be
      true that just, given our polarized our politics is, maybe it’s almost better to be a little bit
      stepped back from just… Let Zelensky explain it and let others explain it. But it is… I don’t know
      if people have fully internalized this. If the largest land war in Europe since 1945 ends in a
      victory or even not a defeat for an unbelievably brutal aggressor who seeks to destroy a neighboring
      nation and, as you say, commit war crimes right and left and so forth, I don’t know if people fully
      understand what that would mean for the next five, 10, 25 years around the world incidentally, not
      just in the rest of Europe.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No. No. I wrote this recently, because I tried to think through, “Okay, what if we hadn’t helped
      them? What if we weren’t there? What would happen?” Well, if the Russians win, we have troops on the
      border with Poland. We have a direct threat to NATO. They’re within a few days driving distance of
      Berlin, as they were before. So remember, Putin has in his head a memory of a Soviet empire that
      included East Berlin. And so for him, that’s very reasonable. We have an emboldened China, which
      looks at this and says, “Right. The Americans lost in Europe. That’s their sort of home territory.
      They’re definitely not going to do anything in Asia.” So we have a China that’s emboldened to take
      Taiwan or invade Taiwan. You would have literally autocracies all over the world saying, “Right.
      America’s out. America’s given up. We don’t have to pay any attention to them anymore.” This network
      of autocrats that I’ve written about, Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, the countries that work
      together would all immediately begin to see their moment and they would begin to understand that
      this is their time to… They can now ignore… They do a pretty good job of ignoring human rights ideas
      and ideals anyway, but they could take it many steps farther. And there would be a blowback to
      American prosperity. There would be a blowback to American prestige. It would have enormous
      implications over the next years and decades. And for that reason, again, I repeat I’m glad we had
      Biden in the White House. I’m glad it was somebody who was willing to take on this cause, even if
      sometimes I wish we could have gone faster and farther.

      Yeah. And I think it would strengthen very much, incidentally, the Hungarys or the… the pro-Orban
      type sentiments in other countries.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Oh, of course.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      And certainly here, America First, people forget in the ’30s, appeasement was strengthened when it
      seemed that the Germans were winning. The terrible behavior of the Nazis didn’t weaken the forces of
      appeasement in Britain. And America First was stronger when it seemed hopeless to fight. What was
      the point of fighting once France had fallen? So the degree to which you would have a world in which
      we really would retreat instead of our half retreat over the last 20 years and all the implications
      for that and the implications elsewhere in Europe, I think people just—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      No. You’re right. Domestic political implications. Autocracy is a winner. Democracy is a loser. That
      would have an echo in our own voting, in our own political patterns. I now think more and more that
      we underestimate the degree to which the Cold War… At the time, we thought, “America’s in the Cold
      War for Europe, right? We’re doing this for others. It’s our selfless…” You know, America in the
      Cold War was also helping to defend American democracy. By putting democracy at the center of our
      foreign policy, by making that part of the national self-definition of who we were, we may have
      protected our own political system much more than we think or certainly than we thought at the time.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      What we do abroad affects how people perceive the country and affects how people behave at home,
      too.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, very much. Well, that’s another conversation we should have. I’m always struck by the civil
      rights movement was at the height of the Cold War.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And part of the rhetoric was we can’t have this at home, because we claim to be standing up for
      democracy. Well, that wasn’t the main thing probably, but it was an important thing. And conversely,
      incidentally in the ’20s when we decided, “Okay, we have nothing to do with any of this. We fought
      in World War I. We got to get back home,” that was the rise of the Klan and so forth. The degree to
      which illiberalism abroad and tolerating illiberalism abroad can make it more tolerable to be a
      liberal at home and vice versa is underrated. I think the more conventional view is the kind of
      libertarian view, which has a certain plausibility of, “Well, it’s a republic, not an empire. If you
      get involved in all these wars, you have a garrison state, you have a national security state, and
      that hurts our liberties.” But I don’t think empirically that’s really the case. It’s more the
      opposite. The Cold War was the time of great expansion of liberties and progress in terms of social
      issues and so forth in the US. And of course, there are instances where you get a backlash and
      McCarthyism and so forth. But yeah, again, I think the indivisibility of… it was kind of a cliche
      during the Cold War. Freedom is indivisible. And I think a lot of us said, “Oh, come on. That’s not
      quite right.” But it is more right than people maybe acknowledged. Don’t you think?
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Yeah. No, I think there’s a relationship. And these things aren’t possible to isolate. You can’t
      pick apart the… But definitely, the more I look back at that period or I see how Americans talked
      about themselves between, I don’t know, 1945 and 1989, the more I think the Cold War had a big
      positive, at least some positive impact.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. Well, I’ll let you go. You’re going, I think, to Germany later this week, and you have a lot
      of… It’s a very busy time for you and for all of us. But look, I’ve appreciated this conversation
      and what you’ve done over the last year especially. And we’ll have to have another conversation. As
      you say, the spring/summer or winter/spring could be very important in terms of the actual… what
      happens on the ground.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Spring and summer are important.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So what’s—
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      And I cannot tell you, I can’t predict for you right now what will happen, but I know there are a
      lot of plans being made.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, let’s hope it goes well and let’s get together in the fall and have an update. But Anne
      Applebaum, thanks very much for joining me today.
  - speaker: Anne Applebaum
    text: |
      Thanks. It was a real pleasure to talk to you again.
