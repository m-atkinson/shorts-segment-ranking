      Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I’m Bill Kristol. I’m very pleased to be joined today by my
      friend John DiIulio, professor of Political Science at Penn, previously at Princeton, student of
      James Q. Wilson, who I studied with a little bit too, but John was really his student
      extraordinaire, and Jim did in him the honor, really, of making him the co-author of Jim’s American
      Government textbook, which I think, at one point at least, was the best selling American government
      textbook for college students
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      It was.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …in the country. Is it still?
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      It was.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Was.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Not quite, but—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s doing okay. It’s—
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      What happens when you go from Major League to AAA is what [inaudible]
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no, it’s an excellent book. And you actually learn, it’s not just a textbook either. You learn…
      it’s not about… some more subtle points as well. John has also experience in politics, local state
      level, and the federal government, describes himself as the New Deal Democrat that we served for a
      year or so in the Bush White House. So a wide ranging background in political science and politics.
      And John, thank you for joining me today.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Thank you, Bill. It’s an honor to be with you as ever.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And John is an expert on many things, actually, but one of them is bureaucracy, which is… But one of
      them is bureaucracy or civil service, or how government actually works, the millions of people who
      make government work as opposed to some of the… in addition to being an expert on various policy
      areas, of course. But the civil service, which is sort of usually a dry and slightly out-of-the-news
      topic, has been coming to the news because Donald Trump has talked about are pretty radical civil
      service reform. So why don’t we just begin by… I’m saying a word about the civil service. I think
      people hear that term—
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Sure.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … and they’re not sure. I’m not sure. What does it mean? And then we can talk about his reform
      proposal and its implications.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Sure. Well, I’m going to try to do this and make it… I can’t promise scintillating. Scintillating
      may come at the end. I don’t know how we’ll get there, but this is a pretty dry topic, but it’s a
      very important one. So let me start… beginning at the beginning, and I’ll actually start with
      President Trump, because when he came into office in 2017, the first year, he didn’t really have
      much to say about the federal workforce or the federal civil service system. In fact, much of what
      he did say was considered quite flattering to the federal service. There were all these nice
      statements, but that changed in 2018. And in 2018, he put out three executive orders. And the real
      burden of those executive orders was to contain or cut federal worker participation in unions. So,
      they were really directed against… About 30 to 35% of all federal workforce employees are unionized.
      That’s less than say, the states, which is like 40 or 45% at the local level, but it was really
      directed at federal employee unionization. That really didn’t go anywhere. It picked up a certain
      amount of controversy and dust, but it really did not have any lasting effects. Then in 2020,
      President Trump proposed the creation of a new federal government job classification for federal
      civilian workers in what is known as the “excepted service.” Now, here’s where we’re going to get a
      little boring, but I promise you we’ll try to pull it back.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But just before we get into that detail, just step back even one step, roughly, how many… What are
      we talking about? A million people? 5 million people?
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      So the exepted service, and that’s E-X, not A-C-C, exepted service, is the one-third of the federal
      workforce. That is not the competitive service. The competitive service covers most of the positions
      in the executive branch. Most of the say 2 million federal civilian workers who are not uniformed
      military personnel and not postal workers. So the excepted services is this other third. The
      competitive service, it’s all what you remember from the great Chester Arthur, my favorite president
      of all time, the Pendleton Act of 1883, preceded by 1871, the Civil Service Reform Act, that really
      created the prototype of what became the civil service. And the proposal and its implications.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So say a word about what that is. So that’s like you don’t get fired for political cause, you don’t
      take bribes.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Sure.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What is the essence of that?
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Throughout the 18th and 19th century, up till 1871, federal workers were just political patronage
      jobs. To the victor went the spoils, and the patronage system was dominant. There was no bigger
      advocate, no bigger prince of patronage than Chester Arthur himself. But then following the murder,
      you’ll remember this from your elementary or high school textbooks, by a disgruntled office seeker,
      President Garfield was murdered. Arthur changed his position, and a man named George Pendleton, a
      Democrat from Ohio, had this proposal they’ve been kicking around for years to create a federal
      civil service or merit system whereby essentially you only get federal employment. It’s only
      awarded, those jobs, on the basis of merit as demonstrated through performance on competitive
      examinations. This was as radical an idea in 1883, as you can imagine, but it passed with bipartisan
      support, overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. Initially, only about 10%
      of all federal jobs… And remember, the federal workforce then is like 100,000, 110,000 people. But
      by the time you get to World War II, excuse me, to World War I, you’re up to about two-thirds
      already of the service covered, and that’s pretty dramatic change in a space of 40 or 50 years. So
      when we think about the federal civil service system, we think about the merit system. You’re
      talking about what we call the competitive service. Now, the uniformed military, right? Obviously,
      there are qualifications for that as well, about 1.4 million folks. If you add them to the five,
      600,000 postal workers, you get a federal workforce of about 4 million. But we’re really talking
      here about the 2 million federal civilian workers, the vast majority of whom are in the competitive
      service. But the competitive doesn’t cover three types of positions. Okay? The senior executive
      service called the senior executives, these are policy positions, higher level positions, but for
      career folks, then there’s presidential appointments that require Senate confirmation, cabinet, sub-
      cabinet. And then this third category, and this is where this proposal Schedule F, so-called, comes
      in, positions that are specifically excepted from the competitive service by statute or by a special
      rule of the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. OPM was created in 1978, and what was really the
      last major restructuring of the federal civil service system, and really the biggest restructuring
      since 1883 under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Let me just say a word, it’s a very quick
      word about that before I go on, because President Trump talks about the need to gain control of the
      federal bureaucracy. A lot of presidents have. It’s important to remember that that was the same
      rationale that President Carter gave back in ’78. He talked about gaining control of the
      bureaucracy. Now, he also wanted to diversify the federal workforce, let unions have more of a role,
      but that was the last major reform. And so as I said, about a third of all federal workers are
      covered by the excepted service, and there are five categories of excepted service.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And that’s the thing we’re talking about now [inaudible]
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      That’s what we’re talking about.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So the person answering your social security query as to whether you should apply at age 62 or 65
      isn’t probably that.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      No. No. In fact, [inaudible]
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That person is just continuing on his or her job as a—
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Right. The people who are in the excepted service, there’s five… There’s A, B, C, D and E. Okay? And
      just in very simple terms, the excepted services vary by whether the positions require policy
      determinations, whether they involve confidential information or relations, whether they require an
      OPM standard qualification, whether they’re considered an urgent or vital need. So you don’t need
      the competitive exam. So for example, I was a Schedule C excepted service employee. When I was the
      White House Faith Czar or whatever, I was an excepted service person. I wasn’t a cabinet person, but
      I had confidential and close relations.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      When I was Bill Bennett’s chief of staff, I was Schedule C.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Same. You were an—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      SES but Schedule C. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      We have to have a party, get all the schedule C people together.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Those are more the policy-making, sensitive, higher level based.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Well, some of them are, and then the A, the B, and the D are less so. You might have chaplains,
      right? You may have data analysts, you may have people, recent STEM graduates. And then there’s
      Schedule E, which everybody always forgets, which is basically administrative law judges, right? So
      now enter Schedule F. Okay? That’s where… So [inaudible]
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s funny. I never even thought… why is it F?
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So there are these five other schedules that already exist as—
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Correct. Correct. Most people, by the way, most people, even the public administration experts go,
      “A, B, C, D. What the heck is E?” So I had to ask my great friend, the great dean of public
      administration scholars, Don Kettl, ” Don, remind me what Schedule E is.” He goes, “Administrative
      law judges. Everybody knows that.” So anyhow, that’s where Schedule E comes from, right? Now—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Schedule F is… Yeah.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Yeah, so [inaudible] Schedule F comes from. So let me try to give you… I always to tell my students
      in 35 years of teaching American politics and government, when you come up against a proposal that
      you’ve done your homework on, you know what you’re talking about, or you feel you do, but you have
      serious reservations or doubts or disagreements, always try to understand the proposal or the item
      the way the advocates do. Try to see it through their eyes. Try to understand it. Try to make the
      best possible case work before you take off critiquing it, or even outright rejecting it. So I’m
      going to try to follow my… Any of my former students out there, practicing what I preached, or
      trying to at least. So as elaborated, and I would say reanimated in the Heritage Foundation’s
      Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership Volume. Let me just pause there to say, I don’t know. I actually
      have a… Here it is. It’s a big, thick, two volumes, two parts. It’s a magnificent document. I’m not
      saying I agree with much that’s in it, but it is a serious, thoughtful, systematic treatment across
      the board. Reminds me of the old Brookings Institution setting domestic priorities volumes that used
      to come out with every presidential election. So my hat is off to them. I don’t agree with a lot
      that’s in there, and I surely don’t agree with the Schedule F proposal, but no one can say it’s not
      thoughtful and well argued. Okay? And so what do they want?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      One thing, if I could interrupt on that, I think it’s an important point just to emphasize that so
      many of my friends who are in anti-Trump world or the Heritage Foundation, it’s crazy, demagogic,
      this and that. It may be a little crazy and ultimately demagogic, if you want to call it that, or
      irresponsible, or whatever, but these people have studied it. It’s a serious proposal in the sense
      that it’s worked out.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      It’s a serious proposal.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And these are people how… They know what Schedules A through E are.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      They know what Schedules A through E are. They know the history of the federal civil service. They
      understand it, and they have an argument. They have an overarching rationale, and they have a set of
      particular rationales. I’ll try to explain in due course why I think they’re wrong or off base, but
      I don’t think anyone can just shrug it off or should. But essentially what they’re arguing,
      essentially schedule F is a proposal to create a new job classification within the excepted service
      for federal workers in policy-related positions. Now, the plot thickens immediately. What it says in
      the volume, what others have said, what President Trump himself has said, you get a number of…
      There’s going to be 20,000 of these positions, or 30, or 40, or 50, or 100,000 of them. I like to
      just say 20,000 or more. Okay? Because that’s what I think the more serious folks who have proposed
      this generally say. So 20,000 or more competitive service positions that would be newly classified
      as policy related. Okay? Stripping them, stripping them of most or all of their civil service and/or
      union protections, and permitting the president and/or the president or political appointees acting
      on his behalf to essentially treat them as at-will employees. Okay? Now, there are presently 4,000…
      The president has about 4,000 political appointees. Okay? So if we just say 20,000, it would add…
      The number will be 24, 25,000. Just hold that thought. We’ll come back to that, right? So these are
      people who operate at the will, and they’re taking these positions out of the competitive service
      and putting them in the accepted service and stripping them of all of their civil service and/or
      union protections. Now, President Trump made this proposal at the very end of his administration, in
      the last few months. No employees, no federal employees were schedule F’d during Trump’s last few
      months. There just wasn’t enough time, and the leaders in the GOP on the Hill were not fully on
      board. In fact, I don’t think they really fully understood it. So nothing happened as it were. And
      this is an important part of the story, Bill, because in much of the discussion that occurs now, you
      hear, especially the people who, as I am, are critical of the proposal, they talk about what Trump
      did, what Trump’s proposing to do, often talk about the most overheated or hyped versions of
      schedule F, I think the facts are pretty alarming, or even dangerous. Nope, not without having to
      hype it, but it’s important to note what President Biden did and has done in relation to this over
      the last three and a half years.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Just one last little introduction for clarification. So just to be clear, these are people… When I
      came to Washington in ’85 as a political appointee, Schedule C political appointee, I was
      interviewed, Bill Bennett wanted to hire me. I had to go to White House personnel. They had to see
      if I was a loyalist to Reagan or whatever other qualifications I had. They had to make sure that
      Ronald Reagan didn’t have some ideas about who should have the particular slot that was allocated
      that then it wanted me to put in because they were people who came from the White House who we
      appointed obviously as political appointees, and eventually I got this job. There were still certain
      minimum requirements. I don’t know that I could have gotten it if I were a felon or if I had…. if
      there was a normal FBI check and so forth, but it’s a… And what you’re saying, if I just get this
      right though, is that at that time, I think there were maybe less than 2000.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      3000 or so, yeah, back then.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Now, there were 4,000. But you’re saying basically, there are 24,000 under this proposal—
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Yeah, if you had… If you do—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …White House personnel or cabinet secretaries where Donald Trump personally say, “I want John
      DiIulio in this job.”
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Exactly.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So then that does not now exist. And now it exists for 4,000. Yeah.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Right. And you’d be converting, you’d be pulling essentially 20,000 or however many jobs out of the
      competitive service.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I see.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      They’re suddenly classified as excepted service and at-will employees, essentially, no civil service
      protections. You had no civil service… I had no civil service protection, as you know. So what does
      President Biden do when he comes in? Okay? The first thing he does early on is he creates something
      called the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. And essentially, what that
      was, it was about unionization. It was about boosting unionization, and it has been very successful,
      for good or for ill, depending on how you view it. But within the first year or so, 80,000
      additional federal employees unionized. So again, that number now, the federal service overall is
      about 35%. Again, below the state and local levels of 40, 45 respectively, but it’s a lot. And so it
      was mainly about unionization. But then over the last year or so, the Biden administration has
      developed and issued a new Office of Personnel Management Rule. And that rule bars career civil
      servants from being reclassified as policy-related or political appointees and preserves all their
      existing civil service protections and all of their accumulated union protections. Okay? Now, that
      OPM rule has not received enough attention. People think it’s like, well, so what did he… Did they
      give him a sheet of paper with six talking points and he picked off…This is a 236 page rationale and
      procedural road map, and it took effect just last month. Now, the thinking, I believe on the part of
      the people who drove this is that, well, were President Trump to return to office in 2025, were he
      to try to start Schedule F and rescind that rule and revive Schedule F, it would take months or
      years to unravel and unwind the new OPM rule, amend the related rules, and get schedule left
      rolling. I don’t think that’s correct. I think that they are being somewhat pollyanna-ish. I
      understand what would have to be done. I think it could be done much more quickly than that. So
      that’s why I feel maybe a little greater sense of urgency about this issue, because I don’t think
      that this is a… It’s imagine no line, if it’s anything.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      It’ll be gotten around rather quickly. And notice what President Biden did not do. Okay? And this
      will get to something maybe we’ll come back to later. What if President Biden instead had come in
      and said, “You know what? That Schedule F idea is a heck of an idea. I have 20, 30, 40, 50,000
      Democrats I would just love to put in to have at will employees and had done so”? You would be
      setting up a dynamic here, right? Forget about whether you think you’d be more comfortable with Al
      Gore doing this than Donald Trump. I would be, but I don’t want it in any case, because part of the
      dynamic here is you would have essentially a hostile takeover of the bureaucracy every time, and I
      mean a deeply hostile one. If you have 2 million, let’s just say, the 2 million federal civilian
      employees, the vast majority of whom are competitive service, and you now have 4,000 people who are
      at will political appointees like you were, and I, those people, and then people in the cabinet
      agencies, so that’s a ratio of one political appointee for every 500 people. Let’s say you go to
      25,000. Let’s say you go to 25,000. Yikes. All of a sudden, here you are. You’re looking at… Yikes,
      in no time at all, go to 100,000. You’re down to one in 20, one in 80, one in 40. That’s almost
      insane, right? There’s no possible reason for that. Fortunately, President Biden didn’t do that. He
      kind of pushed back in a different way. So it’s not just about President Trump. It’s not just about
      the concern about President Trump, though I think that concern is legitimately more acute than it
      would be if it were Al Gore or Barry Goldwater. If it was Woodrow Wilson or Richard Nixon, I’d also
      be more concerned. So it’s not just about who is pushing. It’s the thing itself. Not a good idea for
      a whole host of reasons. I think it’s important to understand though the rationale for this, and if
      you would allow me, if it’s not too boring, I’d like to just read it. I’d like to read into the
      record exactly what Heritage says about this. I’ll take off my glasses. So, I jotted down from those
      two volumes, or at least the chapters on this that I read. So, this is from the Mandate for
      Leadership book, the latest edition, and it’s basically their vision for post Schedule F, federal
      civil service. And this is a quote. “The people elect a president who is charged by Article 2,
      Section 3 of the Constitution with seeing that the laws are faithfully executed and his political
      appointees democratically linked to that legitimating responsibility. An autonomous bureaucracy”
      that we’re going to come back to, “an autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitutional
      status nor separate moral legitimacy. Therefore, career civil servants by themselves should not lead
      policy changes and reforms.” I’m just going to state right now, I agree with that statement. And if
      we had an autonomous bureaucracy, I’d be concerned, but we don’t. Then they go on to talk about
      certain more technical things having to do with how the senior executive service career people have
      been kind of layered in to positions that could have gone to non-career people. And I think that’s a
      legitimate point. I think there has been too much of that over the last many years. Then finally
      this, “Actions such as career staff reserving excessive numbers of key policy positions as career
      reserved to deny them to noncareer SES employees frustrate the 1978 act,” the act I mentioned
      earlier, the last major restructuring, “where frustrate its intent. Another evasion is the general
      domination by career staff on SES personnel evaluation boards, the opposite of noncareer executives
      dominating these critical meeting discussions as expected in the SES. Schedule F should be
      reinstated, but SES responsibility should come first.” And then finally it goes straight after
      federal employee unionization. “Congress should also consider whether public-sector unions are
      appropriate in the first place. The bipartisan consensus up until the middle of the 20th century
      held that these unions were not compatible with constitutional government. And more than a half
      century of experience with public-sector union frustrations of good government management, it is
      hard to avoid reaching the same conclusion.” So what you have here, essentially as the Schedule F
      advocates see it, is what? What you have is a view that just as, was it Clausewitz? You’re the
      philosopher, Bill. Was it Clausewitz, am I getting it… who said that war is the continuation of
      politics by other means?

      They see administration, public administration as the continuation of politics by other means. And
      for 46 years now, the Civil Service Reform Act of ’78, that’s been the battleground, that’s been the
      ground zero in partisan and ideological battles over the extent to which the president can and
      should control the federal bureaucracy and its workforce and the concomitant battle over
      unionization, public employee unionization. Schedule F, however, is not just the latest salvo in
      this battle. It is really the first use of nuclear rather than conventional weapons in this. And I
      can go through, I can pause here, I can go through and talk about what I think it purports to
      accomplish, how it purports to accomplish it, and why the key underlying understanding or the
      background facts really don’t support it.

      No, that would be—

    text: |
      In my view.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That would be great and necessary. So just to interrupt for a second though, correct this if I’m
      wrong. It feels to me like when I was chief of staff at the education department, there was always a
      pull to push and pull, to tug of war in a way between wanting to accomplish certain policy goals and
      career people who would say, “Well.” They’d say many things. They might say, “Yes, that’s a good.
      Okay, we’ll see what we can do to accomplish. We’ll put into motion, put the process into motion to
      accomplish those goals.” They might say, “Well, you should know first of all though that there’s
      laws and regulations on the books that will stop you from going as fast as you’d like or in the
      direction you’d like even. So you need to either get Congress to change those laws or we need to
      formally change those regulations,” which there’s a whole process for, and allows outside groups to
      comment and so forth. Or someone in the general … Or I’m making this up obviously, but Bill Bennett
      would tell me, “See if we can do this.” I would say to the general counsel, “Can we do this?” And
      career people in the office of the general counsel would say, “Well actually, here’s what the
      precedent is on this, and this part would be either unwise or would be overturned, or we really
      think it would just be illegal and you really would put us all at risk of breaking the law if you
      did this.” And so there was that kind of push and pull. I mean, I found it was reasonable balance. I
      mean, you could argue we didn’t have quite enough ability, but you learn a lot from the people
      who’ve been there for 20 years, too if you’re just some political guy coming in with some vague
      notion that I’d like to have more school choice and not just what the teachers’ union want. But
      you’re saying, and that’s kind of I think been the situation for 30 years. I mean it probably
      differs in some different departments and so forth. And there’s slightly different wrinkles on it in
      the Justice Department and Defense Department. But even there, I think it’s basically the situation,
      right? And this does, I guess my question would be, and then you should walk through what you said
      you would. This fundamentally changes the balance of power.

      Well, it does potentially because let’s, and basically makes the… it’s as if the president functions
      as a CEO of a corporation or business that he’s the CEO of, and they’ve done a hostile takeover and
      now they’re going to change everybody from the southwest to the northeast division and put in all
      their people and all that. Just to go back just very quickly historically, there have been a lot of
      histories, as you can imagine, done, a lot of doctoral dissertations and master’s thesis as well,
      books about how in the world did Chester Arthur, how did this come about in 1883? And the answer is
      they realized they were entering a period of industrialization. You had these things out, this
      newfangled thing called interstate commerce with railroads. These were big, important, crazy. And so
      maybe the guy from Philadelphia, the party hack who was really good at helping you win the election,
      might not know quite as much about railway scheduling fees, the relevant technology. You might want
      to have somebody in Washington, in the bureaucracy, in the federal service who actually knew
      something about interstate commerce and railroads and so forth and so on. Well, that’s really the
      predicate of the entire thing. They have it now. Okay, so if I said that to you, and I have to some
      of the fans and advocates so that they say, well, of course, of course, no one’s denying that
      there’s important, that the person at the Environmental Protection Agency that regulates pesticides
      knows more about pesticides and how to regulate them. Or the person at the USDA, the Department of
      Agriculture knows more about summer food nutrition programs and the problems of implementing those.
      They’re not denying that. What they are saying though, and this goes kind of to what you were
      beginning with when you were talking about your own experience. This autonomous bureaucracy claim
      isn’t just autonomous bureaucracy and neutral. It’s that the bureaucracy for decades now—this is the
      underlying argument—has used its, I’ll say ostensible autonomy, to ensure that conservative
      Republican presidents and congresses that win the policy wars lose the administrative and policy
      implementation battles. That’s the core claim. So as they see it, conservative Republicans going
      back to at least Ronald Reagan, some would to go back to Nixon, they’ve won most or many or most of
      the policy wars, but they’ve lost many or most of the administrative battles undone, undermined.
      Because what happens is, rather than according to them, rather than translate these conservative
      policies into effective and ethical action, and then you get the liberal radical Democrats who
      ostensibly dominate the supposedly big bloated federal bureaucracy, have either dragged their feet
      or actively undermined or otherwise functioned as a, here it comes deep state or an administrative
      state that slow walks or suffocates the policies that are favored by Republican presidents and
      congresses. Now, that’s really what’s at, to me, at least at the center of this. And the first thing
      to be said about that in my view is yeah, there have been cases. Of course, there are instances of
      bias, renegade discretion of bureaucrats, outright opposition. It happens. You’d expect it to
      happen. Something that’s spending trillions of dollars a year and has 390 agencies and has an army
      of contractors, you’d expect some of that and no one can deny. It would be almost not quite as daft
      as saying, “Oh, of course, elite liberal universities don’t have faculty members who are
      predominantly Democrats and liberals.” No— tut-tut. Of course they do. And of course the federal
      bureaucracy is disproportionately Democrat and center or left of center. But that’s really not the
      question because there are dramatic and unacceptable exceptions, but they are not the everyday
      rules. That’s my point. Nor could they possibly be the everyday rules in our system of separated
      institutions sharing powers. Check off the three branches. Right? Congress. If you go to, you
      mentioned the late, great James Q Wilson whose real magnum opus I would say was his 1989 book,
      Bureaucracy . I mean, he wrote on a lot of important things, American government and crime and all
      other topics. But that book on bureaucracy really I think is his greatest book. I’m not sure he
      thought that, but I thought that. And in that book, there’s a chapter on Congress. And what the
      chapter on Congress argues and argues it matter of factly as if it’s not trying to— you know, it’s
      not a novel theory. Congress really has tamed the bureaucracy. I mean, if you go, you know, you’re
      getting called up. People, not only the appointees, but investigations, inquiries, constant
      hearings, the bureaucracy, the federal agency can’t spend a penny. It can’t take an action. It can’t
      let a request for a proposal. It can’t supervise a contract without the expressed consent and
      agreement of Congress and the multiple committees that have multiple and overlapping jurisdiction of
      every single federal agency, the 15 cabinet departments, the many independent agencies, whether it’s
      Social Security administration or whatever. So it doesn’t make sense, just prima facie to say that
      it’s an autonomous bureaucracy. If it’s autonomous, they certainly seem to have at least 435 board
      members who are constantly calling them to account and cross pressuring them. Then let’s go to the
      president.

      People are very sensitive and responsive because if a staffer for a congressman who’s on your
      appropriations committee calls up, you won’t do what’s wrong. And hopefully you’ll make sure the
      competitive process works, but you will also make sure that nothing is being done unjustly to that
      person.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Yeah, and presumably. And presumably there’s a law of anticipated reactions that goes on here. I
      mean, you just don’t go off and start doing something. You’re a liberal Democrat who’s ideological
      and partisan, and you’re in, take your pick, I don’t care, the Department of Transportation or the
      Environmental Protection Agency, and here comes a new president of the United States who happens to
      be a conservative Republican. You get up the next morning and you start rocking and rolling and
      trying. You don’t, because you know you can’t. Well, you might want to. I’m not denying that they
      might have the will, but they don’t have the capacity. And I think Wilson’s chapter, which is now
      many decades old, but some folks should go back. I mean, a lot of folks who favor Schedule F are
      also people who are sympathetic to the late great Professor Wilson. They should go and read that
      chapter and see if maybe what he said in ’89 is outmoded and outdated. It’s not. If anything,
      Congress has become, its tentacles have become more deeply, they’re more deeply entrenched in
      congressional oversight and whatnot. So now let’s go to the president, okay? So you have a president
      that’s recommending a Schedule F to get control of the bureaucracy. As I said, you have the 25,000
      would give you an interesting span of control of 1 in 80, go to 50,000, 1 in 40, about 100,000,
      that’s 1 in 20. I mean, that’s almost institutionalized paranoia of a kind. How many do you need to
      do this? I mean, in addition to the fact that those 4,000 political appointees, even people who like
      yourself worked in Washington, Democrat administration, Republican administration. People, they’ve
      even interviewed, there’ve been all kinds of studies and so forth. At the end of the day, they
      pretty much get what they want. At the end of the day, even though we’re not her Majesty service,
      it’s not perfectly neutral. At the end of the day, president’s political appointees exercise
      enormous influence over what the bureaucracy does. I mean, sometimes maybe even too much influence,
      right?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, to the degree that there are limits. It’s actual laws that have been passed by Congress and/or
      upheld by the courts and so forth and actual appropriations bills. It’s not so much that it’s not
      bureaucrats squirming around to stop you from doing things.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      And then last but not least, in these three co-equal branches, the federal judiciary, the courts, we
      just had Supreme Court, nice states roll back the Chevron doctrine. Now we’re going to have judges
      making those decisions about, I guess pesticides and summer food nutrition programs. Look, there are
      people in the federal bureaucracy, and I think this is one of the important hard facts that, or
      let’s put it this way, one of the important ways in which the federal bureaucrats get caricatured
      rather than characterized. There are 2 million federal civilian workers other than uniform military
      and postal workers. 90% of them live outside the beltway. Okay? There’s a hundred thousand of them
      in Florida. There’s 120,000 of them in Texas. So, the two red states, or two pretty red states have
      over 10% of the federal bureaucrats living as their neighbors working, shopping. They’re in
      communities. They’re not inside the beltway, and they are basically folks who came into the federal…
      Most of the people come into federal service. Yes, they favor, they’re looking for job security and
      so forth. But it’s really remarkable that these people, if you’ve been in a particular agency for 10
      or 12 years, you know an awful lot of stuff about whatever that is. If you’re in the Department of
      Justice and you’re in the Bureau of Justice Statistics, I mean, you’re one of the great, you must be
      one of the greatest census takers in the world because they put out the second-largest census of any
      agency through the National Crime Victimization Survey. I mean, those people could be teaching…
      should be teaching statistics and survey research at Harvard or other great universities. Is it okay
      to say Harvard’s a great university anymore? I don’t know. But okay universities… or once-great
      universities, whatever. But it’s stunning. So, the idea that… And then the actual nature of their
      jobs, and this is where frankly, schedule F proponents and opponents, most of them, not all of them
      fall down. Most of those 2 million people are contract administrators. I mean, there is a deep
      state, but the real deep state is the contractor state. There are seven, the equivalent of seven
      full-time employees on the federal payroll who are not counted on the federal payroll for every one
      federal bureaucrat. So what most of those people are doing, the 20, 30,000 at EPA, what they’re
      actually doing is overseeing other people who actually are the ones who translate federal laws and
      programs and policies into action. It’s not direct public administration. It hasn’t been for 50
      years. So there’s this vast shadow government, if you want to call it that. There’s this vast
      contractor state, the Department of Defense leading the way on that. And what most of these folks
      actually do is oversee and administer grants and contracts. So that reality, if you’re worried about
      gaining control of the bureaucracy, if you’re worried about they’re going to under exercise,
      renegade discretion, undermine, and either slow walk or suffocate my policies and programs and the
      direction they’re going to push back against the direction I want the government to go, you got a
      bigger problem. Because they’re not doing the direct administration. They’re really intermediaries.
      They’re almost intercessors. Okay? So how do you get a handle on the real deep state, the contractor
      state? And here’s where I don’t know the answer to that here at all. I mean, that’s the real
      problem. And the real deeper problem there is that, and we have two parties in this country. We have
      the red party of tax less and the blue party of spend more. And every election, they win every
      election together. That’s how we have a deficit financed and a proxy administered government because
      nobody likes taxes and nobody likes bureaucracy. And so we create these systems, we create deficits,
      and we create proxy administration and have 10, 12, 13, 14 million people who are not on the federal
      books, but are defacto federal employees, people who have never drawn a check in their lives from
      anything other than the US Treasury, who are not counted as federal civil servants or bureaucrats.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. Interesting. So let me try a proposition now to bring it to more how it could be though
      abu— You’ve given sort of the why it’s probably unwise, even if it were done in good faith and why
      it’s either unnecessary or unwise. It was a matter of the balance of, I don’t know what to call it
      exactly, political direction and expertise, competency and so forth. But one can also say this, that
      the current system, if it errs, maybe it errs too much on the side of entrenched bureaucratic ways
      of doing things. EPA has hired a certain contractor in Ohio to test the acidity of the rivers and
      the lakes from rain every year. And they get used to doing that and they don’t have as good a
      competitive system to get the latest technology in or whatever. That would be sort of the wrap on
      the federal government, right? Kind of sclerotic a little, bureaucratic, as we say, very slow to
      adjust to new technologies and so forth. And there’s probably some truth to that, but that’s one
      downside and one can try to correct that in certain ways. as civil service reform efforts, which we
      can maybe come back to in a minute, have. The other downside, though, of, let’s call it the Trump
      Heritage system, pushed even harder though, is it’s not EPA [inaudible] hiring the same folks over
      and over who do the test. It’s a political appointee, removable at will, in EPA, ordering that his
      cousin’s firm in Ohio be hired and making sure that that firm in turn only hires Trump-friendly, I
      don’t know what, people, and that they also don’t report back results that aren’t friendly to
      Trump’s policy agenda. I don’t know which is more, acid rain or something. I don’t know. And you can
      imagine this in a million different areas, and I think there, don’t you think that, I mean the
      balancing of competency and loyalty, if you want to call it that, or expertise in politics is
      there’s always going to be a gray zone where people can differ. But it feels like on the Heritage
      Trump side, the degree to which with a president who is obsessed with loyalty, with Cabinet officers
      who are willing to push very hard in that direction, with incidentally the Chevron decision and the
      immunity decision and Trump talking about pardoning people and a general sense that you’re not going
      to pay a price for going too far in the loyalty et cetera direction, combined with the civil service
      reform, you kind of are sailing off towards perhaps a pretty dangerous and at least irresponsible
      loyalty first and down through the ranks. Because then you do get the kind of trickle-down effect
      that even if the person underneath the Schedule F employee, who’s just a non-excepted career civil
      service, but Schedule F guy has the ability to promote or not promote, and isn’t quite as
      deferential as Heritage even points out to the established civil service boards, which say, well,
      this person has done a better job over the last six years, he deserves the raise. No, I want to give
      that person a raise because he’s been more accommodating to me. He gave the contract to my cousin in
      Ohio. I mean, I feel that’s I think why some of the alarmism is there.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Yeah. And I think it’s right to be very nervous and onto alarm, not hysterical at this point, but
      alarmed, and take it very seriously. But here’s the thing, the federal bureaucrats sitting there,
      these two million people under all this congressional scrutiny, being poked by 4,000 political
      appointees, being overseen by courts, these folks who, again, are functioning mainly as contract
      administrators, it’s almost as if the system has been set up for federal civil servants to be used
      by members of Congress, both parties, the way bagmen are used by criminal syndicates. They’re just a
      middleman. Because right now they’re under enormous pressure to deliver those contracts to the
      people who are politically favored. And there are people on both sides of the aisle and Congress at
      the other end, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. There’s lots of pressure. And so it’s no accident
      that for many decades you couldn’t even take past vendor performance into account in deciding
      whether to renew a contract. It was literally against the law. Why? Because they wanted to be sure,
      and everybody, it’s a quid pro quo. It’s a log rolling thing, you get yours, we get ours, D’s, R’s,
      doesn’t matter. And then the second thing, Bill, is be alarmed as you want to be if it’s not your
      favorite politician, but assume it’s your favorite politician, whoever that might be. How about
      Whitmer? Shapiro? They come in. I don’t want them to have it, either. Why? For the same reason.
      Number one, what it’s looking past, what everybody’s just looking past, is I challenge you, go and
      look at every major instance of government failure, of poor government performance, even malfeasance
      of Teapot Dome proportions, whether it’s Medicare overpayments or whether it’s the Hubble Space
      Telescope. And tell me where that performance failure occurred. And I’m going to tell you that in 99
      out of a hundred cases, it occurred in the chain of implementation from the bureaucrat all the way
      down the proxies, the contractors and the grantees. It’s always down the chain. It’s really
      difficult to measure, it’s really difficult to manage a long chain, a long implementation chain. And
      it’s definitely difficult when you are basically under political pressure constantly to defer to the
      contractors because they’re the ones that have friends on Capitol Hill who call you in to answer why
      you haven’t done exactly, fully, and precisely what they want you to do. So if we’re interested in,
      we’ve had the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. We had the Modernization Act of 2010.
      They did some good. We had the Clinton-Gore Reinventing Government National Performance Group. It
      did some good, but the real need for civil service reform, what we should really be focusing on if
      we care about the public interest and the common good and also protecting the procedural safeguards,
      the old saying of the late great Herb Kaufman of Yale about red tape, “One person’s red tape is
      another person’s treasured procedural safeguard.” We care about… the bureaucracy is the hands and
      feet of important democratic public purposes. I know that sounds rather schmaltzy, but I really
      believe that we care about that. Then we want to be able to have a government performance as the
      focus. Are the policies being translated into action, to the extent you can determine what the law
      says, the way Congress writes laws these days and has been for the last 50 years? Is it being
      implemented in an ethical and effective fashion? Are we trying to make government—to go back to
      Clinton-Gore—work better and cost less? Why do we have these persistent failures and these cost
      overruns? I submit to you that you will not find the answers to those questions by looking for
      malfeasance and poor performance within the federal civil service. But you will find it outside. You
      will find it in the real deep contractor state, which is in that proxy chain.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I think what would make it worse, for me when I was in the Education Department, it was useful
      to be able to say honestly to members of Congress who called up or influential friends of big shots
      in the White House, or I don’t know, I’m making this up, but Ronald Reagan’s third cousin or
      something, “I’ve looked at that and I can’t do it. I mean, there are these laws and regulations and
      we just can’t do it.” And to the degree you weaken that infrastructure, which is another word for
      red tape perhaps, and for excessive constraints, you might say, on politically appointed types, it
      also weakens, though, the checks on the outside, kind of just government becoming a plaything for
      every outside group. That’s one point I’d make, which you should obviously feel free to comment on.
      The other one is I would say we’ve been… your examples have been sort of EPA, Department of
      Transportation. I think that’s the bulk of the workforce. But you get to Department of Justice and
      to some degree Defense Department, depending on what kinds of, or intelligence community and stuff,
      they’re a little bit set up differently often because they are more sensitive. But the constraints
      that have built up over the decades there I think are pretty important. They were post-Watergate in
      many cases. Again, maybe they went too far in some cases. People should take a fresh look. But we
      know what happened or what Nixon tried to do in Watergate. And I do feel like part of this, I don’t
      know if this is literally part of the Heritage schedule after proposal or part of the impulse behind
      it will also be to remove all these constraints. I mean, the number of lectures I got when I became
      Vice President Quayle’s chief of staff, that I couldn’t call the Justice Department at this. I
      couldn’t even ask about the status of a criminal investigation. Even if I happened to know John Blow
      out there who seemed like he was getting unfairly investigated, I could put in, I could have a
      formal, maybe someone else could submit a formal request for review. I can’t even remember if we
      were allowed to even weigh in on that. I don’t think so. So anyway, I just feel like the whole, you
      get to a kind of rule of law, use of the sensitive powers of government issue. It’s a little bit
      beyond EPA favoritism to a crony.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      No, I think you’ve said a mouthful that’s true. They’re also a couple of principles here that are
      put in jeopardy by this proposal and by concomitant proposals, “Schedule F-light” proposals, I call
      them. The first principle, which we’ve pretty much accepted for the last 140 years, is that federal
      government employment should be awarded mainly, if not solely, on the basis of merit, as
      demonstrated through performance on competitive exams. And the second principle is that it’s
      presumptively against federal law to hire, demote, or fire people as federal employees for political
      reasons, period. Now we don’t need to go through the history of the Hatch Act of ’39, all that. I
      agree with the Brownlow Commission during President Roosevelt, 1937, issued this famous report,
      Lewis Brownlow.. “the president needs help.” And the president does need help. He’s got help. He’s
      got 4,000 people. But what the president doesn’t need and shouldn’t have in our constitutional
      system of separate institutions [inaudible] is control. The president does not need control. If
      you’re interested in reforming the civil service, and let’s stipulate, as the lawyers say, that
      there is bias, that there is a leaning, that there have been egregious and unacceptable cases, let’s
      just stipulate that that’s largely true. Why is the answer to that to get a gang of 10, 20, 30,000
      people to go in, and then with all of the costs, with all of the multiple and competing values at
      stake here, the balance, upsetting that balance, why not go to the front end and say, okay, what
      that tells me is we need to have a heck of a different system in terms of who gets hired in this
      system and what you’re going to hear… Let’s screen, let’s make sure that we have people who are
      genuinely competent. Let’s make sure we try to recruit people who are more likely by all kinds of
      various personnel classification, test measures, more likely to be, if they’re green eye shade, let
      them be green eye shade, not blue eye shade or red eye shade. Let them be green eye shade. I
      shouldn’t say that because of the Green Party. Let’s make it orange eye shade. But the bottom line
      is it’s doable. Those kinds of reforms have often been suggested, they’ve often been tried, and it
      always breaks down. They’re always superseded by something a little more dramatic, like most
      dramatic than schedule F. And I think that it’s unfortunate that in Congress you always had a group
      of people who didn’t get many political rewards or points for it. I mean, whatever you think of the
      late Senator Roth of Delaware who was behind the ’93 Government Performance Results Act, you had
      people in Congress in both parties who cared about the character and quality of the federal civil
      service and quality. They really did. And they came forward and they tried. And we’ve had a dozen
      commissions. You had the late great Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who led
      the Volcker Commission in 1990 and put out a series of really thoughtful, good reforms, most of
      which were totally ignored. We don’t have that now on Capitol Hill. There really isn’t a good
      government public administration caucus. There just really isn’t anymore. And that’s a real problem.
      So if it becomes, the bureaucracy, if the federal service and the battle over unionization, which
      again, I have an argument in response to that. I mean, yeah, it’s true. Presumptively back in the
      day, there wasn’t government employee unions, they weren’t a big part of the equation either in the
      federal service or at the state and local level. Now they are, they emphatically are, and there are
      good parts of that and bad parts of that. I admit there are good parts, there are bad parts. If
      that’s really what we want to fight about, let’s fight about that and not have that bound up with
      all these other issues. Because if you do this version of schedule F, what you’re going to have
      unequivocally is hostile takeover after hostile takeover. And there can be no long-term planning.
      You’re going to cultivate people who are essentially just waiting for the next administration to
      come in and change everything over. You’re going to have people not waiting for permission slips,
      but you’re going to have people doing nothing because nothing is the safest thing to do. It’s a
      very, very bad way to go. There are all kinds of far-reaching reforms that one could contemplate. I
      mean, nobody should deny that the federal civil service system needs reforming, changing. It can be
      hidebound, all that, but this is a cure worse than the disease, frankly, in my view.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      That’s very interesting. And I think I want to ask you a little bit about the reforms. The funny
      thing, the funny thing, the ironic thing about the discussion I suppose, is that you’ve been in
      favor of civil reforms forever. You’ve spent a lot of time working and have consulted, I believe, on
      some of these informally, at least on some of these efforts for reinventing government and so forth.
      But just to put a pin in the risks of the Heritage type approach, yeah, I mean, you can use this.
      There are sclerotic companies that have been presided over by—I’m using this in the private sector
      [inaudible] area—by the same types of CEOs for 20 years, and they’re kind of behind the curve and
      don’t work very well. They could some shaking up, a new CEO, some new division heads, some different
      rules for who you hire from the outside perhaps and so forth. But that’s I think the kind of thing
      you’ve been thinking about, and we’ll get back to that in a second. There’s then the sort of
      corporate raiders come in and we’re going to sell off the parts of it and gut it, and that’s
      problematic. But maybe ultimately it works out okay in the private sector because they sell off
      parts to other companies. It’s not like they’re not, what am I trying to say? Exercising,
      administering the rule of law. They’re not running the CIA and the NSA. They’re not in charge of the
      United States military and a president who might invoke the Insurrection Act. But so whatever you
      think of corporate raiders in the private sector, it’s very different from having that spirit in the
      public sector. But then you go beyond corporate raiders to criminal syndicates, let’s say. You’re
      talking about the ratio of one to 80, one to 40. This is one to one, right? Everyone is basically
      just, it’s loyalty. The rest of it is kind of, you prefer to have more competent loyalists who can
      carry out the crimes better than others. But the key is the loyalty. And I feel like there’s even
      the risk of sliding towards that with this proposal and some of the key agencies actually, not even
      to the kind of dysfunctional corporate raider model applied to the public sector. So again, I come
      back to the downside of it just seems to be so much greater than the upsides.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      It is. The downside is greater, far greater in my view, in fact, emphatically so. But I’ll say to
      you just again, little facts, facts don’t necessarily matter as much as they used to, if they ever
      mattered as much as I thought they did. But during the GOP primaries, you had different candidates
      outbidding each other for how many federal bureaucrats they were going to eliminate on day one,
      quote unquote, a hundred thousand. So I did a little calculation and showed, why don’t you eliminate
      the whole thing? You get rid of all two million of them, you’ll save about $300 billion. Nobody,
      it’s going to be an interesting day, the next day when you have to store nuclear waste or figure out
      how to regulate pesticides or send grandma’s Social Security check out, but let’s just get all of
      them. That’s under five percent of the annual federal budget. So if you eliminate the entire federal
      stuff, just all of them, they’re gone tomorrow, everybody gets a pink slip, and you save under five
      percent. I mean, it’s just kind of ludicrous. Then you consider the fact that, okay, who are these
      bureaucrats again? Who are these? Well, 50% of them are in two agencies. Pretty popular agencies,
      actually, with conservatives as well as most folks, the Department of Defense and the Veterans
      Administration. It’s 50% of these two million people. And then you have to get down pretty far
      before you get to the smaller agencies, especially the Department of Education has nine people, and
      it’s a small [inaudible]. But when the Clinton-Gore administration—I was a big supporter of Vice
      President Gore in particular, I thought he was terrific, especially on these issues—When they came
      out with their reinventing government proposal back in the early nineties, I was at Brookings. I was
      the whatever, Douglas Dillon fellow or whatever, at the Center for Public Management with the great
      Don Kettl, and we went after it hammer and tongue. Why? Because we thought that while it was well-
      intentioned, and we had a lot of good friends who were in that White House, who remained friends
      after a while, you mend fences and all that. But we issued report after report, starting with a book
      called
  - speaker: Improving Government Performance
    text: |
      An Owner’s Manual , where we just took apart the Clinton plan. Then when the Clintons came out with,
      and I say the Clintons, because it was really the then First Lady, as I need not tell you, with her
      healthcare plan, we did a report, several reports on healthcare showing that there was no possible
      way to administer that with their health alliances. Well, you could do it in Washington State. So
      that would be the only state that could actually administer it. So I guess what I would say is I
      come at this, I mean it’s Heritage and it’s President Trump and so forth, so obviously you may have
      a different perch coming at it, but for me it’s the same thing. There are facts here that are
      critical and important that are being left out. There are values here, multiple competing values
      that need to be balanced thoughtfully, and there are legitimate arguments to have about all of this.
      But it’s a mistake, it’s a bad mistake to set in motion a plan that had Schedule F been proposed
      earlier in the administration, President Trump’s administration, had they actually acted on it and
      been able to act on it, do you have any doubt that in 2021 when President Biden came in that he
      would say, “Oh yeah?” And they would just layer in their people and so you have a new 20,000 or 30
      or whatever the number would be. It’s a terrible way to go about, to create, to have the
      bureaucracy, so-called, the federal agencies become essentially a war zone, not a demilitarized zone
      because at the end of the day, I mean you could say it’s the fourth branch and it’s autonomous, you
      can say all that. It’s not really true. And to the extent that it’s true, there are ways of
      surgically going at that rather than taking really a meat cleaver to the agencies and to the
      competitive service.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s really well said. I think the last places you want to have be a war zone are defense and
      justice and so forth.
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      If I may add, just we live in an era of divided party government, right? We know that. I mean, it’s
      rare to have the president and the Congress, maybe that’s a good thing. And we know that it actually
      doesn’t, at least the political science suggests it actually doesn’t affect the legislative
      productivity. But what it does affect is administrative and in policy implementation. The war, when
      you have divided party government, it doesn’t register as much in the policymaking realm as it does
      in the administrative realm, because that’s where everybody goes to war. You lose. And this is where
      heritage is absolutely correct, it is the case, but both parties do it, right? Trump’s in there, the
      Democrats throw everything and the kitchen sink at them with respect to the oversight. Biden’s in
      there, the Republicans throw everything and the kitchen sink at them in the oversight process. And
      that’s fair. I mean that’s like a prize fight with everybody stands up and there’s a referee and
      there’s rules and there’s three knockdowns and so forth. This is a street fight. When you do
      something like this, all you’re doing is setting up sort of a continuous street fight between the
      parties, between the liberals and the conservatives, the extreme right, the extreme left.
      Personalities will matter. Again, as I say, Woodrow Wilson, Richard Nixon, Donald Trump, I have a
      little more concern than with Al Gore, Barry Goldwater, etc. But I think that it’s just a very bad
      idea and I wish that we could find a way to come reason together to find the responsible. The Venn
      diagram of we all agree, for example, when certain things are wrong, can we work on that first and
      show good faith? I think there are people, I really do think there are people, including folks who
      very strongly support the Schedule F plan, or at least parts of it, who are serious about trying.
      They really do believe they’re trying to do good, I’m not saying that the principals or the
      political folks involved, but the people who dedicate a lot of their lives to thinking about these
      issues. And then there are people on, I mean I am a big supporter of unions. I mean, I’m not as
      crazy about public employee unions as I am about private ones, but we are down to 6% at private
      unions and all these kinds of crazy mandatory arbitration agreements that squeeze workers rights. So
      I’m clear about that, but I’m happy to have a discussion about unionized public. There is a lot of
      problems with it. I mean it shouldn’t just grow and grow. I agree with that, but let’s have that
      conversation rather than basically we win, you lose. To the victor goes the spoils was never really
      a good idea.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Not if you want to have an ongoing functioning civil society and government and society. Let me ask
      you one last, this really excellent broader point that you just made though. So if we’re speaking on
      July 3rd, totally of course, just now making, [inaudible]. So if President Biden withdraws in a week
      or two and your governor Josh Shapiro becomes the president Democratic nominee and he calls you up
      and he says, “Okay, John, Trump’s getting some traction with all these attacks on public sector.”
      Everyone has had some experience where government doesn’t work as well as it should. They tend to,
      people blur in their own minds, of course, local state, government and the federal. So it’s the
      DMV’s is horrible, it’s like actually that’s not the federal government’s fault probably, but
      whatever. But he says, “I need sort of three points that are intelligible to people of how I’m going
      to reform government. I’m not just a status quo guy. Biden, you can portray, he is the incumbent
      after all. So he’s sort of the status quo guy by definition. But I’m Josh Shapiro. I’m a young
      reform governor.” I know the actual reform proposals will be complex and administration is such an
      important part of it and execution. I think that’s an important point you’ve made in passing that
      people just wildly underrate any points of that as opposed to the concept that we’re doing. But is
      there a way, would there be two or three bullet point headlines as it were for Josh Shapiro?
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      Well, on that happy day, were that happy day to come, I think the first thing I’d probably tell him
      is, “Governor, you got the wrong broken down, old professor, sick old professor. Call the great Dr.
      Don Kettl there in Austin, Texas.” But I think the three points would be, first of all, you have to
      have a fundamental overhaul of the civil service competitive exam hiring process. People have talked
      about that for years. Changes have been made, but it is still about matching the person to the job
      and the person to the agency. And that still doesn’t work very well. It’s clear that the Social
      Security administration needs help. That the Social Security Administration is doing a whole range
      of things now that it didn’t do 10, 12, 15 years ago. And it’s doing it, frankly, under greater
      stress. You need people who can… you need to basically have a more targeted, more, if you want to
      put it this way, surgical approach to federal hiring and deployment of people, right? That’s the
      first thing. So get rid of these kind of skills job mismatches that are everywhere. Once you get
      somebody there who’s layered in and you have somebody over here in a different agency, you can’t
      just move them, say, “Well, look, you’re way better billed to do this than John is, so we’re going
      to switch you around.” And that’s where the legitimate, I don’t know, my union protections, I’ve
      accumulated the civil service protections. So you need more flexibility. There’s no question you
      need to overhaul the front end. Then to jump to the back end. There has to be, at some point,
      somebody needs to seriously take a look at the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of
      dollars a year that are going out in federal grants and contract and ask the innocent question, what
      are we getting back for it all? Now we have the great Government Accountability Office. I think
      they’re spectacular. The Congressional Research Service, they do a very good job, but nobody reads
      these reports and nobody much cares. And they are kind of, it’s one of the greatest resources. By
      the way, if you want to learn about how federal government today works, just go and read all those
      GAO reports. You’ll be, you may find something more interesting to do in a few minutes after you
      begin, but they are spectacular. That said, what we haven’t had ever really is a proposal to go
      through and systematically look at how the contracting process works, what the criteria are for
      renewing contracts. And I’m not, by the way, I mean President Eisenhower was absolutely right when
      he warned about the military industrial complex, but there’s also a nonprofit industrial complex.
      There are entrenched interests here. I’m not saying they’re all bad people, who the same groups and
      same organizations, whether it’s the big, big defense contractors or the relatively medium sized
      nonprofits get the grants and contracts constantly. Part of the whole initiative for Faith-based was
      to break that up a little bit with respect to social service delivery. There were people who were
      being left out unfairly, unconstitutionally, who could do a good job, do more and better with less.
      So you got to look at the contracting process and you also have to make it, and I think this is the
      third thing, is it’s a bad idea and this is where the late great Paul Volcker, when he turned 90, we
      had, there was a conference in his honor and he was a great friend of mine, a tremendous regard for
      him. We put out a volume in his honor. He died shortly thereafter. But a lot of focus on the part of
      people who really study this for a living has been on the ways and means of trying to get a handle
      on what happens in the day-to-day of it in a given federal agency. If you look at the Department of
      Transportation or you look at the Department of Energy, you’d be shocked at how it actually works.
      90 plus percent of what, say the Department of Energy does, is contracted out. 90 plus percent of
      every dollar they get goes out the door. Now that’s not prima facie a bad thing, but how do they do
      that? How do they know? So there needs to be a, I hate to go back to case studies, which people like
      you and me probably like more than some of the other stuff that you get in political science, but
      you need to go back and do what the Brookings institution did. Geez, almost a hundred years ago, as
      the new deal was being put into place, there were these studies that were done agency by agency or
      proposed agency by agency to really look A to Z and Z to A. Now at that point, Governor Shapiro has
      already hung up the phone and called somebody, called somebody else. He’s like, “This guy’s totally
      useless.” But those are the things I would do. You got to look at the front end, the back end, and
      in the middle, so to speak. And there is no appetite right now on the part of anybody I know in
      Washington, for the first time, really in my adult lifetime, I would say that, it’s always been true
      that these issues have not been top line issues and they only get attention when there’s a scandal
      or the Hubble Space Telescope or something bad happens. When the catcher drops the ball, so to
      speak. And most of the time nobody pays attention. But there had always been people, there aren’t
      anymore. I mean that’s an important part of this because the White House, the Biden White House, and
      the thing that I mentioned, the workers forum that they did, the organization that they created in
      year one to push unionization, I mean that was a political effort, obviously more than anything
      else. Didn’t really spill over into anything positive by way of, “Okay, let’s think about what we do
      with these people or why do we really need [inaudible] about this.” The last serious effort we had
      really was the Clinton-Gore effort, and they did make our mutual friend Steve Kelman, for example,
      at the Harvard Kennedy School, you can credit Professor Kelman with making and engineering some of
      the most important reforms in procurement and purchasing, saved, by now I wouldn’t be surprised if
      it was in the hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars by virtue of changing that hidebound
      procurement system. So I would love to know, for example, what the candidates would have to say if
      they were asked the question that you just asked. If you can’t, and the answer can’t be Schedule F
      or [inaudible]. It has to be something else. I don’t think they have anything to say, because no
      one’s really paying attention to this.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You think, just last question, I think I said that would be the last one. Let me ask you one more
      and we can give it a short shrift. There’s not much to say. Is more of this happening at the state
      and local level, or is it also there kind of bogged down and sort of [inaudible].
  - speaker: John Diiulio
    text: |
      No, I actually think, here’s the great thing about our [inaudible] or laboratories of democracy
      days, and this is one of them in this field, despite the fact that the federal government has had
      nothing but woes for the last many years, I’m not going back through, I’m talking about not just
      Trump, Trump, Biden, and even frankly, end of the Obama years, at least after 2010, not a whole lot
      of wonderful things happening. The state and local governments have been by and large innovators,
      they’ve been trying stuff. They’ve been figuring out ways to do better and make things cost less.
      They’ve been much more open, frankly, in a funny way. They have come around to the idea that you
      need to look for a much more diverse set of contractors and grantees. It’s not that anybody put out
      a press release or made it a book, but it’s happening. And you talk to people who study state and
      local government and you’ll hear pretty much the same thing. That it’s been a period of innovation
      and experimentation. Now, have all the experiments been successful? No. Are they still trying? Yes.
      But you see an interesting phenomenon with respect to cost consciousness and focus on government
      performance and results. That I think, for me at least, is sort of the old Rockefeller Institute for
      Government at SUNY Albany that the late great Dick Nathan used to run, has always been one of the
      places that did those kinds of studies and they’re still doing them. But there’s a lot more interest
      in state and local government now on the part of a lot of diverse scholars, I would say, and also
      much more interest in jobs like who’s the city managing director of Omaha or Philadelphia and what
      are they doing? So I’m much more optimistic about the state and local level. But of course, Bill, to
      conclude, you can’t do state and local without the feds because almost everything touches
      intergovernmental. And so if the federal government catches a cold, the state and local governments
      may catch pneumonia. How the feds go, so goes, for good or for ill, so goes a lot of state and local
      public administration. Which is why we just can’t struggle, say “Oh, the heck with it.” Schedule F,
      not schedule F, you got to pay attention to if you care about good government in any way.
