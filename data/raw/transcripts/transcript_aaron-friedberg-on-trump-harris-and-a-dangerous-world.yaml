      Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I’m Bill Kristol. Very pleased to be joined today, once again,
      by Aaron Friedberg, Professor of Politics at Princeton, a Non-Resident Fellow at the American
      Enterprise Institute, a leading scholar of International Relations, in general, and China policy in
      particular. Most recent book, I think, is Getting China Wrong . That’s about Aaron’s colleagues, not
      about Aaron himself, got it right. I believe that’s the subtitle of the book. And he did get it
      right, actually. And we’ve had a conversation, or two maybe, on China, a very much worth going back
      to. Our most recent conversation was at the very beginning of this year on China, mostly, as well as
      the world, in general. But I thought today we could talk about, what are we at, it’s Monday,
      September 30th. After a very busy weekend in the Middle East and the usual busyness elsewhere in the
      world, I thought we could talk about the general world situation, it’s implications for our election
      campaign, Election Day is five weeks away, and really try to help people think about this moment in
      international affairs, but also our own political history. So Aaron, thank you for joining me.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Thank you very much, Bill.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, maybe let’s begin with, I want to get, obviously, to the choice we face, the different foreign
      policy options facing the American public, and their implications. But maybe just begin with, just
      the world, and do a quick lightning round, as it were, of a general sense of things. It doesn’t seem
      like things have calmed down a lot since we spoke in January of 2024.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No, it’s to the contrary. I think they’ve heated up pretty much in all directions.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it is striking, isn’t it? You could think these things go cyclically, but this case, say well,
      let’s just go quickly around, the Middle East, the most obvious, but we should begin, say a word
      about that.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yeah, well obviously, there Israel is fighting on multiple fronts, continuing to fight in Gaza
      without any clear end point to that conflict. They don’t seem to have achieved fully their military
      objectives and they’ve resisted pressure to agree to any kind of ceasefire, so they’re continuing
      their operations there. And then the war with Hezbollah, which has been ongoing, in a way, I guess
      it’s been ongoing for a couple of decades. Low-grade conflict has flared up with a series of
      remarkable Israeli strikes against Hezbollah at all levels, culminating, at least for the moment,
      with the airstrikes that killed the leader, Nasrallah, just a couple of days ago, and everybody’s
      waiting for the other foot to fall, whether that’s Hezbollah retaliation, or Iranian retaliation, or
      an Israeli incursion into Southern Lebanon on the ground, which is something which seems like a real
      possibility. So that’s percolating. And the Houthis continue to harass shipping in the Red Sea. And
      the Israelis have also evidently conducted some operations against the Houthis, so that’s ongoing.
      In Europe—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Let’s just, on the Middle East—
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …for one second. Yeah. And the Iranian nuclear program hasn’t come to a halt, I don’t think. And
      they seem to have suppressed their domestic troubles for a while, at least, unfortunately. So, yeah,
      it’s pretty unstable situation. It looked for a while, like, I don’t know, there wasn’t going to be
      a new Middle East, but the Abraham Accords, and a little bit of, and Gaza was, one forgets, quiet,
      not quiet-ish, more or less quiet, until a year ago. The Hezbollah situation was a standoff. It is a
      good lesson in how the post-October 7th Middle East feels like it’s not found to new equilibrium and
      probably won’t for a while.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No, I think that’s right. We don’t know where any of the dimensions of this are going to go. I
      suppose there is a possibility that Israel could escalate further against Iran or if there’s some
      kind of direct exchange. The next step up the ladder, it seems to me, would be for Israel to take
      action against Iran’s nuclear program. But they haven’t shown any inclination to do that. So yeah,
      this is, I think, the best possible outcome, at least of this most recent exchange with Hezbollah
      from an Israeli point of view, is that they buy themselves time. I don’t think anyone believes that
      Hezbollah is going to collapse and go away, or that Nasrallah is not going to be replaced by
      somebody. So this is going to be ongoing. But as has happened in the past, going back to 2006, the
      last time they had a real war directly with Hezbollah, it was fought to a standstill, but it also
      led to an extended period of more or less quiet. And I suppose that’s what the Israelis are hoping
      for.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s also striking to me just one more second on the Middle East that Israel hits Yemen, it’s a take
      because the Houthis had launched, I guess, missiles at Israel…
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …a pretty big attack, it sounds like, from the air on the Houthis in Yemen, which again, is
      something which just, it barely makes it up to page nine, or the virtual page nine, on the websites.
      It’s a big, once upon a time, that would’ve been a big story, I think, Israel flying quite a long
      way away to do this, but getting apparently a green light, yellow light, from a lot of the Arab
      nations. And then we, I guess, conducted two raids in Syria in the last, or against Syria, against
      Al-Qaeda and ISIS-type forces in Syria, in the last two weeks. We announced them after we had done
      them…
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …which I suppose is prudent. But again, it is barely, it was like in the headlines. We’re using, it
      seems like pretty, not major, but a significant counterterrorism operation there, too. And direct
      involvement of the U.S., that was—
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Right. And I guess, although we can’t be sure what’s going to happen next, what’s striking, and
      maybe one of the reasons that these events don’t get as much attention as they might otherwise is,
      the expectation in the past might’ve been any action is going to lead to some enormous and
      catastrophic reaction. And what’s been striking is how little and how ineffective the reactions have
      been to both what Israel has done and what the United States has done. And in particular, from the
      Iranians. Their big contribution was to fire all these missiles at Israel back in the spring, and
      that was a dud. Those were all shot down, minimal effect. So it’s not clear what capacity, I’m
      thinking here, particularly the Iranians, what capacity they actually have to hit back, and how
      willing they are to go up the next step on the ladder. Thus far, as I said, when they’ve tried it
      hasn’t worked out well for them. And they seem to be hanging back. And that may be part of the
      Israeli calculation. They may have come to the conclusion that really, for various reasons, the
      Iranians either can’t or won’t take direct, escalatory steps. And what the Israelis are doing to
      Iran’s surrogates is, among other things, humiliating to the Iranians and diminishes their perceived
      power in the region. And from Israel’s point of view, that has to be a good thing.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, I suppose Iran could wait and take retaliatory terrorist actions and so forth as opposed to
      direct military actions.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. They have enormous capacity, as we know from the past to do that kind of thing. And they may
      yet.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And then just on our actions, it’s a reminder that the War on Terror isn’t over, and that
      unfortunately because of Afghanistan, perhaps in part, that the al-Qaeda and ISIS, they never fully
      went away and they seem to reconstituting themselves. So again, a reminder of that side of the
      challenge as well, I suppose.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes, and it’s quite possible that the United States could become even more of a target, in part,
      because of what’s been going on in U.S. support for Israel. That doesn’t seem to have happened
      directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we’re going to see this
      problem grow and take different forms, but it isn’t going to go away. There will continue to be
      terrorism, terrorist attacks on targets in the region and outside the region, conceivably.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yuck. Meanwhile, the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years is going ahead. It’s not ceased or
      even diminished in intensity, really.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. And I gather the Russians are slowly, slowly making progress. Ukraine has conducted this
      counteroffensive, which continues into Russian territory. But there’s no sign there of any kind of
      decisive outcome in either direction. I guess there was hope some time ago that the Ukrainian forces
      might be able to roll back the Russians. And I think, for the most part, people have given up on
      this thought, at least for the foreseeable future. So is this headed for some kind of a stalemate?
      What might break the stalemate? To what extent would the United States and others support Ukraine in
      taking action that could conceivably have that effect, even at the risk of escalation with Russia?
      So that’s by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in
      the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the
      limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine’s use of weapons. And also providing more of
      them to Ukraine, conceivably, along with others in Europe. There’s a fair amount of people singing
      up to do that, which could move things in one direction, which would have its own effects in terms
      of Putin, I suppose. Or the opposite, obviously, if Trump were to win and try to insist on some kind
      of negotiated settlement. So anyway, though, very unpleasant stalemate, not even a stable stalemate,
      if I can put it that way.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No, I don’t think it’s reached that point. And therefore, in part for that reason, both sides
      clearly want to keep on. They haven’t reached the point where they’ve both suffered enough pain and
      paid enough of a price that they’re willing to consider some kind of ceasefire or try to come to
      some negotiated settlement. I don’t see that in the offing. As you say, and maybe we come back to
      this, there are those two branches, question of whether the U.S. and others would assist the
      Ukrainians in escalating in some way that might have hope of bringing about a more successful
      outcome. Or, whether we might under, for example, a Trump Administration, put pressure on Ukraine to
      come to terms with the Russians, even as things stand now, giving up a chunk of their territory,
      effectively.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And the other point people don’t, I think, make quite often enough about this situation, Anne
      Applebaum’s made this point in conversations here, and some others have. But if you have a more
      conventional border war, you can have a stalemate, and you can have a negotiated temporary
      settlements, at least. If you have a semi-genocidal war against the country you’re conquering, and
      trying to kidnap its children, and kill and torture people, and so forth, it’s a little hard to know
      what even a stalemate or agreement on territory would mean. Are they really going to just allow
      Russia to just destroy and devastate millions of Ukrainians? So the nature of the war, I think,
      makes it harder to get to.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes, and I think, also, the nature of the technologies involved, the fact that you have these long
      range standoff weapons on both sides, so even if you had a stabilized front on the ground, you could
      continue to have strikes on infrastructure and military targets going back and forth in both
      directions.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s really a good point. People don’t make that point too often. So let’s talk about
      demilitarized zone. What does that even mean when much of the war’s being fought at long distance?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, yeah. And then China, just to wrap up their little tour de [inaudible] here. That’s been, I
      guess, superficially a little quieter, Asia, maybe than Europe or the Middle East, but not, I take
      it, in your judgment, more settled or stable than it was nine months ago?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No, certainly not. Although it is, of the three theaters that we’re talking about now, it is the
      quietest in that there isn’t the ongoing, large-scale shooting war. The tensions, obviously, between
      the United States and China continue. China continues to apply pressure to Taiwan. They’ve been
      doing things to put more pressure on the Philippines. And I think more concerning, perhaps more
      important is the pace of the Chinese buildup of its military capabilities across the board,
      including, now, a large nuclear buildup. So that one, maybe, is burning at a lower flame for the
      moment. But it’s obviously, or in my view, it’s the biggest long-term threat and problem. But the
      Chinese haven’t, thus far, been eager to push it beyond where it is now. They seem pretty content to
      keep things at, again, a certain low boil, continue to develop their capabilities.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Say a word about the relationship of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. You’ve stressed this in past
      conversations, the—
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. Yeah. That, I think, when we spoke last, and I think maybe even in a prior conversation at the
      time, I was thinking about a piece I had written about, not a stunningly original notion, but that
      there was an axis of authoritarians that had emerged and seemed to be operating in closer and closer
      alignment. And the question from my side was, to what extent are we going to succeed in building a
      functioning coalition of democracies, global coalition, that would include our allies in Europe and
      in Asia cooperating with us and working together jointly to deal with this growing threat, which is
      emerging from the center of Eurasia, if you like, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. They are all
      cooperating with each other in different ways. And it appears that that cooperation has grown more
      and more sophisticated and complex. China is clearly doing a lot to help the Russians, as far as we
      know, they’re doing everything but selling them large quantities of armaments, maybe there’ve been
      some small shipments of arms in the past, there’ve been some reports of that. But they’re, of
      course, major provider of all the components, electronic, mechanical, that the Russians need to
      build and rebuild some of their sophisticated capabilities. So China is helping Russia. The Iranians
      are helping the Russians by selling them drones in large quantities. And that’s where they’ve been
      getting a lot of the equipment that they’ve been using against Ukraine. The North Koreans and the
      Russians have a deal, the full dimensions of which, I think, we don’t fully understand, but seem to
      involve supplies of conventional munitions from North Korea to Russia, artillery shells, and perhaps
      also Russian assistance to North Korea, in the further development of its ballistic missiles and its
      nuclear weapons capabilities. China always, I think, thinks of North Korea as a problem, but also as
      a state that relies or has relied historically on China, maybe a little concerned that they’re
      striking off and drawing closer to Russia, but that’s also a relationship that has significance. On
      the China-Russia, There have also been accounts just in the last month where U.S. Officials have
      made comments. They haven’t provided a lot of detail, about transfers of Russian technology to China
      of a sort which includes capabilities that in the past, the Russians have held back, the Crown
      Jewels or the remaining Crown Jewels of the Russian arsenal. And then the Chinese also helped the
      Iranians in various ways, including by being the biggest purchaser of Iranian oil, which has been
      constrained by sanctions. They are supposedly, I believe it’s over a million barrels a day through
      this dark fleet that the Russians or that the Chinese use, so they’re not seen to be directly
      purchasing oil. But they’re helping Iran by buying its oil. And there probably is also technical
      cooperation. Something else that a number of people have wondered about is the extent to which there
      may be direct or indirect Chinese learning going on from both the war in Ukraine and the fights that
      are going on in the Middle East. And there are a lot of weapon systems that are being used and
      tested on both sides. This is an opportunity to see Western, or particularly American, weapons and
      how they’re used. And it’s also an opportunity to test various concepts of operations and weapons
      that the Chinese are interested in. So whether there are Chinese observers on the ground, as there
      were German and Soviet observers on the ground during the Spanish Civil War or not, China is
      watching this very carefully and undoubtedly learning lessons from it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Wow. And we talked about a week ago or 10 days ago, and one reason I wanted to have this
      conversation was the comment you made, you were walking through some of this stuff just very quickly
      with me, and then I think you said something like, “But of course the biggest source of instability
      or concern right now is probably our election,” not any of these actual, not to minimize these
      foreign policy developments… but not simply these foreign policy developments. And so let’s get to
      our election and the choice we face, explain that. One can imagine the dangerous world and we’ve had
      it in the past. And a U.S. that’s ready to deal with it. Or maybe not ready to deal with it, but
      that in any cases, on a certain path, that’s kind of established and set. That’s not the case now,
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Right. I don’t know that I would say that the United States is the biggest source of instability,
      but the biggest source of uncertainty right now I think we know what all of the other actors we’ve
      been talking about are going to do over the next six months, year. They’re probably going to
      continue along the path they’ve been following. The biggest uncertainty is what we’re going to do.
      And I think that does depend on the outcome of our election. And it may be that there’s greater
      variance or greater potential variance in some of these domains than others, but there is a great
      deal of uncertainty. And as a result, there’s a great deal of anxiety on the part of our allies
      about what direction U.S. policy is going to take and what the implications for them may be. Maybe
      this was eased somewhat back in 2020 by the outcome of the election. And I think for the most part,
      our friends and allies have been content. They haven’t always been pleased by everything that Biden
      Administration is doing, but I think they’ve found it to be more predictable. And there is this
      underlying anxiety, both in Asia and in Europe, and more so in Europe, probably, about what exactly
      a Trump 2.0 would look like. So that hangs over all of this.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And so explain that in more, why isn’t this just the normal Bush, V. Kerry in 2004? There’s always
      been some uncertainty and some differences in opinion about what we should be doing during the Cold
      War and during the post-Cold War era. But is this like that, or something more fundamental?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No, I think the range of possibilities, if Trump comes back, the range of possible policies in each
      of these areas and across other domains too, is just much wider than would have been typically the
      case in the past, particularly obviously we’re talking about foreign policy. So the range of
      possibilities there is quite wide. We can talk about Harris, there are uncertainties about what she
      would do, but I think the range of uncertainty there is fairly narrow compared to what is the case
      with Trump. And that has partly to do with his past record and partly to do with uncertainty about
      who exactly would emerge around him and who might have influence over policy in a second Trump
      administration. And some of those people, at least in their expressed views and their past track
      records, are maybe closer to a kind of conventional, traditional Republican hardline approach to
      foreign and defense policy. And some of them are completely different. Some of them really are
      isolationists, and I don’t think anyone can say with assurance if there are such groups, which one
      is going to emerge dominant. And I think there are some reasons to think that the second of the two
      would probably in the end win out because I think they are probably closer to what Trump himself
      actually believes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I think Vance makes that much more likely. I think Vance’s pick, whether Trump attended it this
      way or not, means he’ll be there if Trump wins, as vice president. And he really seems to believe in
      America First, and I assume will insist that America First types populate most of the key positions
      of the administration. And Trump will insist that people who go along with him on January 6th get
      first crack, not the people who voted to certify the election. You put those two things together,
      you do end up, I think with an America, much more of an America First administration, a much less of
      a Reagan Republican administration.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. And I don’t think we’re going to see the cycling through more traditional figures who will then
      get fired or quit after six months, 12 months, 18 months. It just doesn’t seem like that’s likely
      for one thing because most of those people have been eliminated. But there are, if you go down the
      list and think of people, Robert O’Brien or Pompeo or people have mentioned Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio…
      At least before Trump came on the scene, I would’ve said those people were all kind of traditional
      hardline, Reagan-type Republicans. And to varying degrees, when they’ve spoken on some of these
      issues, they’ve continued to take that kind of position, always being careful, of course, not to
      contradict Trump or not to be critical of him. So that’s a cast of characters who could conceivably
      emerge or some of those people could emerge. We don’t know what their views would be once they were
      in office. What we do know is that ultimately they would have to do what Trump wanted them to do or
      they would be out. But at least at the outset, it’s possible that you could have a Secretary of
      State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor, who again, at least based on their expressed
      views, might appear to be more, how to say it? Normal or familiar Republicans. But then there’s a
      whole other cast of characters, Steve Bannon, Rick Grinnell, Stephen Miller, who knows, who could
      easily emerge as important. Kash Patel, dominant figures even in parts of a new Trump
      administration. And those people, again, to the extent we can judge their views, are very, very
      different, and would be America Firsters, for lack of a better term, isolationists I would say. And
      they’ll also be, assuming that there is another faction, they would be struggling for Trump’s ear.
      And again, my guess would be in the end, that side of the spectrum, people with those kinds of
      views, traditional Democratic allies, I don’t know that all of those people share Trump’s personal
      affinity for some of the dictators that he’s engaged with. But overall, these are people who are
      much less interested in talking about human rights or judging the quality of another regime based on
      its ideology and style of governance. That seems to be much more in harmony with Trump’s own views.
      But again, we don’t know. But to get back to your question, what that means is the range of
      uncertainty, the range of possible policies under a Trump administration is just extremely wide. And
      just the last point, it’s not just a function of, and this would be more normal if you had schools
      of thought that are going to fight and maybe they’re going to compromise and one’s going to win on
      this and one’s going to win on the other. Sitting on top of this, you have the maximum leader who’s
      mercurial, capable of changing his mind, going from one thing to another. The thought that that
      administration with that leader is going to be capable of formulating, implementing and executing
      anything resembling a coherent sustained strategy, I think is fanciful.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that was very interesting because I had been thinking a little more actually of the gulf
      between a Harris foreign policy and a Trump foreign policy, which itself is a bigger split, I think
      you could say. The paths are more divergent than typically has been the case and a choice between,
      again, Kerry and Bush or whatever you want, Carter and Dole, even the Cold War choices really. But
      you make a very good point about Trump himself and his administration itself being uncertain. But
      maybe say a word also about just the choice in November in the sense of, I mean, Harris and Trump,
      they are, I mean, we should say, just say a word if you wish, about uncertainty about Harris too.
      But the basic thrusts of those two foreign policies would be pretty different now.

      I think so. I have in my mind a picture of two sort of branches. So there’s Trump on the one side,
      there’s Harris on the other, and each of those branches has two sub-branches underneath. So there’s
      Trump and there’s Trump with a dominant influence of a more, I don’t know, traditional Republican
      foreign defense policy, perhaps driven by some of the characters that I’ve mentioned. And then
      there’s Trump with these other people who would be pushing for a set of policies that would be
      really radically different and might continue some of the themes that Trump raised at least even if
      he didn’t get to the point of actually implementing them fully in his first administration. And then
      on the other side, you have the Democrats, Harris, and I think the question about Harris might be,
      is Harris going to be Biden 2.0 or is it going to be Obama 2.0? To me, that’s sort of the range of
      variation, and that’s much narrower. And obviously there would be differences between either type of
      Trump administration and either type of Harris administration, but the differences between those two
      notional forms of a Harris administration are much, much narrower and much more, I don’t know, much
      more traditional and familiar. And so the widest gap would be suppose that you got a much more left-
      leaning Harris foreign policy and a much more right-leaning Trump foreign policy. And both are
      possible, although I think it’s less likely in fact that Harris is going to go in some dramatically
      different direction than the direction that Biden has been following. But the array of possibilities
      is quite wide.

      And it seems to me, correct me if I’m wrong on this, on both China and the Middle East, you could
      argue they end up maybe not so wildly different from each other, the two Democratic, let’s just say
      Democratic and Republican administration, Trump and Harris. Whichever version of Harris you get, and
      to some degree, whichever version of Trump we get, I do think on Russia-Ukraine, it just seems
      pretty much more black and white. I mean, just hard to believe. Trump is just not going to be
      spending the next two or three years supporting Ukraine, it doesn’t feel like, and fighting Putin
      and quite the contrary. The only question is how pro-Putin he’ll be or how much he’ll be sort of
      neutral, you might say, between Ukraine and Putin. And I think Harris, it’s pretty safe bet, will be
      like Biden. Now, some of us would wish her to be stronger in helping Ukraine, but again, that’s an
      unusual, I feel like, difference between the two candidates on what is probably the most important
      short and medium term, at least, choice facing the US and maybe the world.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      I agree with that. If you take those three areas, regions and ongoing crises or tensions, yeah, I
      think the variation on Russia-Ukraine would be the widest, and it’s pretty clear. And even the
      people who are trying to make Trump out to be a coherent thinker and are writing articles describing
      what Trump’s foreign policy could be in this sort of parallel universe where he pursues a consistent
      set of policies. And by the way, most of those people describe policies which are sort of Reaganites
      and I guess reflect their own preferences, but I don’t think they really reflect Trump’s. But even
      those people have a hard time saying that, well, Trump in the end would really stick to supporting
      Ukraine and standing up to Russia. So I think the range of variation on that issue is greatest.
      There may be, and we can perhaps talk about them, there may be differences that would emerge on
      those other issues on China and on the Middle East, but Russia-Ukraine, it seems pretty stark. And
      Trump has not been doing or saying anything to suggest otherwise. I mean, on many issues where he
      seems to sense that there may be strong opposition to positions that he’s taken, he’s sort of fudged
      it and pulled back, but he hasn’t really done that on Russia-Ukraine. I haven’t read the full
      transcript of his encounter with Zelensky, but people are pointing to this or some people are
      pointing to this, “Well, they met and it was very cordial, and how can you say that Trump would be
      hostile to Ukraine?” But if you read at least the portions of the transcript I saw, the reason he
      likes Zelensky now, he says, is Zelensky really could have stuck it to him during the first
      impeachment investigation by saying that he felt pressured. But instead, he said that he didn’t, and
      therefore he helped Trump. Well, of course, you think about it, and Zelensky’s position at the time,
      is he going to inject himself into this controversy and say, “Yes, Trump was twisting my arm,” with
      the possibility that Trump would in fact not be impeached as happened and then would wreak vengeance
      on him? So as with everything with Trump, his judgment on this person and this issue is almost
      entirely personal. So short answer to your question is yes, there would be a lot of difference. And
      judging by what Trump has said, and even more what Vance has said, I think there’s every reason to
      believe that a new Trump administration would at a minimum put enormous pressure on the Ukrainians
      to come to terms to, and Trump has said this, to accept it’s very sad they lost some of their
      territory, but really they can never get it back and they need to just accept that. Some of the
      people around Trump who again have been trying to articulate policies that sound more or less
      coherent, have said, well, what Trump would do is to say to the Russians and the Ukrainians, “You
      need to come to terms. And Russia, if you don’t, then I’m going to increase support for Ukraine,”
      which is kind of laughable because what else is he going to give them? I mean, there may be some
      things he could give them that we’re not giving them, but that just would be inconsistent with
      everything else that he said, and saying to Ukraine, “If you don’t come to terms, we’re going to cut
      you off.” Well, that’s quite plausible, it seems to me, unfortunately. And that I think would be the
      most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens.

      That last sentence is so important. I want to get to it in a second, but I just did a podcast with
      my colleague, Tim Miller, who made a very good point I hadn’t quite focused on, which is we take so
      much for granted that Trump behaves the way he behaves. I mean, how astonishing is it that he’s with
      the head of a government that’s fighting, of a nation that’s fighting for its life against the
      brutal aggressor? We’ve been with it for, on its side, as almost the whole world has been really,
      the whole civilized world. And there’s not a sentence that I could see, I skimmed the transcript
      also, of sympathy for Ukraine, of solidarity, of, “Look, we so admire what you and your citizens
      have been doing.” You could then say, if you wished, “We may have to, I’m not sure we can get the
      maximum war aims that you hope for.” And sometimes he has to make compromises you don’t want to
      make. But the fact that it doesn’t even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US
      presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its
      life is so revealing, I think.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yeah, and praising them for standing up for their freedom and fighting, even when, I mean, it could
      have been critical of the Biden administration saying that initially they didn’t believe that
      Ukraine could defend itself, but of course, Trump himself had taken a similar view. Again, I haven’t
      read the full transcript, but the bit that I saw that referred to the war and the consequences
      talked about all the buildings that had been knocked down. And he says something like, “If they
      hadn’t done this, these buildings would still be standing, then they’d be there for 2,000 years,” or
      something like that. So yeah, I didn’t see anything there. Praising Ukraine for its resolve,
      praising Ukrainian democracy for rallying its people to defend their own government and their own
      territory, sympathy for the losses. He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don’t know,
      there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There’s no sense that there’s one side
      that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject. And that is
      revealing because I think that is the way he looks at it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And if that becomes the first kind of big fork in the road he faces as president, which I guess it
      might, support for Ukraine, you just said a word about the ramifications elsewhere. So say something
      about that. It’s not as if these things, they do have an effect, even if he thinks he’s going to be
      status quo and with respect to China for six months or something like that.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, and this is one of the problems I have, again, with people who are trying to put forward a
      coherent alternative to policies that the current administration has been pursuing or alternative
      grand strategies, Asia First, that kind of thing, as if you could take this piece off the board and
      ignore it or somehow that it would take care of itself and everything else would remain the same.
      And of course, that’s not the way the world really works. So if you imagine a world in which the US
      pulls back its support from Ukraine, presumably our European allies might at least for some period
      of time try to fill that gap. And I think they’ve been thinking about how they could do it and
      whether they could do it, but I don’t think anybody believes that they could in the long run do that
      on their own. So imagine a world in which the Russians have successfully conquered all of Ukraine. I
      mean, you don’t have to conjure up nightmarish notions of what would happen. We’ve seen what happens
      in territory that Russia takes from Ukraine. There’s mass murder, there’s deportations, forced
      deportations, kidnapping of children, destruction of industrial capacity. It would be nightmarish,
      and you would have an outpouring of refugees, and you’d also have Russian forces sitting that much
      further to the west and on the border of US friends and allies. So the consequences in Europe and
      Putin emboldened, presumably, by his success, he would be able to say, “I, just like past great
      Russian leaders,” maybe he wouldn’t invoke Stalin, but that’s clearly who he would have in mind,
      “took a punch, but we Russians don’t give up, and we mobilized our industry and mobilized our
      people, and we won this great victory.” Does anyone think that he then is going to be content and
      isn’t going to cast his eye to the Baltics or even cast his eye further to the west? That seems to
      me highly unlikely. He’s expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia
      to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the
      American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a
      defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don’t know where exactly that would lead, but it
      can’t be anywhere good. So that’s the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me
      would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms,
      which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and
      probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn’t do anything. So that would be the first
      set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over
      years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one
      domain has an effect on others. I don’t know. I haven’t kept up with the literature. So it can go
      back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, “Oh, there’s no connection
      between these things.” But that too seems to me highly unlikely. What are our friends and allies in
      Asia going to make of this outcome? And they’ve been very blunt now, Japanese leaders in particular,
      but Taiwanese too, saying, “We have a stake in the outcome of this war between Ukraine and Russia
      because what happens there today could happen in Asia tomorrow.” So what would be the responses to
      that? I suppose you could say they’re going to cling even more tightly to the United States, and
      maybe in the first instance that would be true, but I think the leaders of Japan, Korea, Taiwan too,
      would be foolish if they didn’t consider the possibility that they too at some point might be hung
      out to dry. And they would have to think seriously about how they could defend themselves under
      those circumstances. And one obvious answer to that question is to acquire their own nuclear
      weapons. South Korean— there’s been an open discussion about that in South Korea and Japan. It’s
      more of a taboo subject, but less than it once was. So there are kind of quieter conversations about
      that going on. And again, a world in which the United States has pretty clearly been defeated and
      Russia has succeeded with the help of China is one in which confidence in American security
      guarantees can only go down, and leaders are going to have to think about how to fend for
      themselves.

      And with the help of Iran, I mean, I think if you’re Saudi Arabia, you don’t have as nearly as
      direct as stake in this as other countries. The effects might be a little more indirect, but I don’t
      know, do you really think if the US won’t go to any extra trouble to help a country that’s bordering
      NATO and is democracy in Europe, a place we’ve been committed to forever and willing to risk NATO
      for this because we don’t want to just send more arms to Ukraine, what is, I don’t know, do they
      really think we’re a viable partner? Suddenly the Saudis, I think get less interested in a defense
      deal with us and more interested in their own nuclear program conceivably, right? They might be
      friendly with Trump and they’re busy giving money to his family and all this, so maybe they could
      buy them off short term, but I guess that’s the thing. Don’t you think that you can imagine short-
      term scenarios where nothing falls apart in the next six or 12 or 18 months, and Trump might have
      personal reasons for being friendly to MBS, so even there’s no immediate movement on that front, or
      same you might say for Israel incidentally. But longer term, what’s the reliability of the US under
      someone who has shown the willingness to be as, I guess, I don’t know, what, cavalier about our
      commitments as Trump?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      I don’t see how foreign leaders could not worry about the possibility that they too could find
      themselves in a situation where the United States was not there when they needed them, whatever the
      stated policy of a Trump administration on that issue might be. And then they have to ask
      themselves, well, what can we do to take care of ourselves? Because they’re not just going to give
      in to their enemies, presumably. Maybe we can get to this, but one of the things that I find
      frustrating, I guess, about the discussion on foreign policy alone and the comparison between a
      notional Harris administration and a notional Trump II administration, is that it tends to ignore a
      whole set of other problematic issues, which arguably are more domestic or internal that would arise
      I think under a Trump administration, which would raise deep questions about the stability of our
      political system and of the fragmentation of our society, and that’s the foundation on which
      American power ultimately rests. And I think we have every reason to fear that a second Trump
      administration would exacerbate those problems and would reinforce the notion that you find, for
      example, in contemporary Chinese analysis of where the US stands, that we’re not exactly a paper
      tiger. We have many strengths, but we also have these, from their perspective, critical weaknesses
      and vulnerabilities, and they’re almost entirely to do with the state of our society and the state
      of our political institutions. And I think in many ways they’re betting on that, counting on that
      because power is always relative, and power in the Chinese view is the sum total of all different
      kinds of capabilities, including those related to the strength of the domestic system. So it’s not
      just about what we do or don’t do in Ukraine or what we do or don’t do with Taiwan. It’s also about
      what we, or happens to us internally and what the implications of that are for our credibility and
      our ability to act as a power in the world. I mean, that’s the deepest source of my concern. Yes,
      it’s about the possible policies that Trump II might follow. And maybe they wouldn’t be as bad, and
      maybe this more traditional strain of thinking would have some influence on various specific
      questions. But does anyone think that a new Trump administration is going to be suddenly sober and
      serious about adhering to the law, about resisting the temptation to use its powers to oppress or
      persecute its domestic enemies? I think we know what we’re in for on those counts. And all of that
      would, in my view, would dramatically weaken the United States, both in practical terms and in moral
      terms. I mean we’re already in a bit of trouble on that score. We used to be able to think of
      ourselves as a beacon of democracy. And we still are in my view, and we’re still viewed in that way
      to some degree by many people around the world, but it’s a lot easier for people to say, “You’re in
      no position to lecture us. Look at how your system is dysfunctional,” and none of that is going to
      get better under Trump. It’s going to get worse.

      You haven’t said anything about international economic policy, which you’ve actually have written on
      very interestingly in terms of dealing with China. Maybe say a word both about what you think we
      could or should be doing. Do you think the Harris and a Harris administration would go in the
      direction, which you should explain, that you would like? But also what about the Trump tariffs? I
      mean, that’s a big deal in foreign policy even though it’s dealt within the economics departments
      more than in the political science departments, I guess.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Right, right. Well, as far as what we should do, I’ve written this piece, it was in the last issue
      of Foreign Affairs , about how to respond to the so-called second China shock, which is this massive
      outpouring of manufactured goods and the possible damaging implications of that for new industries
      emerging in advanced industrial countries. Also, harmful consequences for the efforts of advanced
      democracies to de-risk by reducing their dependence on China for a whole array of so-called
      intermediate goods, everything almost down to nuts and bolts, but not quite critical minerals.
      That’s one that’s attracted a lot of attention. So if China is pushing out all this stuff at a very
      low price and the United States and countries in Asia and some countries in Europe are trying to
      build up their own domestic capacity, those efforts are going to be derailed because they will be
      undercut by, if they allow these goods to keep flooding into their markets, by these low-cost
      imports—and it’ll also have damaging consequences—is for the prospects of developing countries that
      are trying to build up their own industrial capacity. So this is a serious problem that has been
      percolating for some time. It is getting worse in part because of the weaknesses in China’s own
      system. It’s inability or unwillingness to do things that would allow domestic consumption to
      increase. They are more reliant than in the past, or in the immediate past, on exports. So they have
      to push all this stuff out, and it’s coming. And we’re not going to talk them out of it, and wagging
      a finger at them or telling them, as we have repeatedly, that there’s an alternative path, you
      should liberalize and so on is not going to work. So in my view, we need to defend ourselves against
      it, but we can’t do it unilaterally. And what I propose in the article is a trade defense coalition,
      which would be a grouping of countries starting with our closest friends and allies, but also
      including some other industrial powers that see their prospects and their domestic industries being
      threatened by Chinese exports and imposing some kind of protective barrier between themselves and
      China. There are all kinds of issues with that. It’s not something that’s going to be easy to do,
      but I think of that as an alternative to what I see either a Trump administration or a Harris-Biden
      2.0 administration from being inclined to do, although maybe it’s closer to the latter. Trump’s
      position is tariffs are great. He continues to talk about how the tariffs have raised all of this
      money. Well, it’s mostly come from domestic consumers and producers who have to pay higher prices.
      And he wants to impose a, he says, a 60% tariffs on all exports from China, but also he wants to
      impose 10% tariffs on all imports from all around the world, so including from our friends and
      allies. So whatever else it might do, this would exacerbate differences between ourselves and our
      closest friends and allies. And we went through a minor version of this when the Biden
      administration began the Inflation Reduction Act. Subsidies, and the Europeans found that they were
      left out. And according to at least some reports that high officials in the Biden administration,
      perhaps joking, said, “Oh, we didn’t mean that, but we sort of forgot about you,” and they’ve done
      things to try to fix that. But the course of action that Trump proposes would be one that would, I
      think, isolate the United States from the people that we need to collaborate with in dealing with
      China economically and from dealing with Russia and these other problems strategically. So that’s at
      one end. I don’t know exactly, of course, what a Harris administration would do. I think the Biden
      administration has taken some steps in the right direction. They’ve imposed some tariffs on Chinese
      electric vehicles and some of the other pieces of the so-called green energy transition. And they’ve
      also begun to think about how to subsidize or how to encourage domestic production, but it’s been
      pretty narrow and pretty selective. And I think it’s going to have to be wider than that, and it’s
      going to have to be done on a coalition basis. So yeah, those issues are coming and they’re here
      already and there’s question of how Harris or a Trump administration would respond. The thing we
      know, I think most likely a Harris administration would continue on the path that Biden is
      following, which is okay as far as it goes, but it needs to go a lot further. I think from
      everything we know, Trump would go off in a very different direction that would I think scuttle the
      possibility of forming a tighter coalition of friendly countries economically to deal with China
      because I think he sees them all as unfair competitors and taking advantage of the United States and
      wants to impose tariffs on everybody.

      Right, and Taiwan, as he said in this interview with I think it was Businessweek back over the
      summer, Taiwan has stolen our semiconductor industry, and he raised this in the context of a
      question that asked him if he would be inclined to help defend Taiwan, which you would’ve thought
      from all of the tough talk from some of the people around him and from him would’ve been an easy
      answer to give. In fact, what he says is, “We shouldn’t be paying for their defense. They should be
      paying us, and they stole our semiconductor industry.” The attempt to make Trump out to be a
      consistent and coherent tough guy in dealing with China doesn’t stand up to the facts. He did indeed
      impose or pursue or really permit people in his administration to pursue policies that were quite
      tough on China, and I suppose he or they deserve credit for that, but he also continues to express
      this personal affection for Xi Jinping. I think if the Chinese had been smarter and given him this
      great deal that he was bragging about and just bought a few hundred billion more dollars of stuff
      from us, some of these other measures, like export controls and technology controls, might not have
      gotten off the ground. So what’s he going to do when he comes back? I don’t think he has a
      principled form of or basis for his opposition to China any more than he does for his opposition to
      Russia or than for any affinity that he might feel, which I don’t think he does, for our democratic
      allies in Europe. So there’s no principle there. So the idea that he’s going to follow a consistent
      tough strategy for dealing with China, I think is questionable at best.

      People who want to give him the benefit of the doubt, will interpret one nice thing he says about
      one democratic ally or about Israel, let’s say, a country people are concerned about, obviously, and
      think that’s really a sound basis for thinking his foreign policy is going to be fine. But there’s
      so much evidence that he’s willing, as you say, if the Chinese decide, well, you know what, he’s
      back in office so maybe we should give him some economic Bennies now and a little bit of bribery.
      It’s not bribery literally, but it could be that too. But I mean bribery in the sense of rewards for
      stuff, and then he’ll let the pressure off, right? I mean, I think you’ve thought about this so
      much, I mean, the risks of pursuing a foreign policy in the world we’re in, and if you’re the US,
      the anchor of resisting all these bad forces, a policy that’s not grounded on some degree of medium
      and long-term thinking and strategic thinking as opposed to this thing, I like this guy here and
      that guy there, and I’m going to threaten him here, but then I’m going to reward him there, I just
      think, I don’t know, people don’t seem to me to appreciate the risks of that.

      Right. Well, historically, to the extent that we have pursued a consistent grand strategy, if you
      like, over long periods of time, those have been rooted in geopolitical calculations, but also in
      values or ideology. We’re not a country that is led by people who are simply cold-blooded
      calculators of our political interest. Sometimes we have leaders who are more that way than others,
      but they need to mobilize the American people, and the way that they’ve done that historically has
      been on questions of right and wrong or freedom and opposition to authoritarianism and dictatorship.
      If you don’t have a coherent geopolitical view, and you also don’t have any adherence to those
      values, I don’t see what the foundation is for a consistent policy or strategy. People who sing
      Trump’s praises and say he’s a tough guy and people are afraid of him because they don’t know what
      he might do, and he might take dramatic action, they’re not wrong in that, and that can be valuable
      up to a point. The perception that someone is maybe a little irrational or willing to take risks,
      let’s say… that may be right, but that’s not the foundation on which you build, again, a grand
      strategy that you can hope as a country to continue to pursue over years or decades if that’s what’s
      necessary, and it seems to me that that is what’s necessary. I mean, let’s go back to what we
      started with. If we’re faced with this rough alliance of authoritarian powers that now is behaving
      in a very aggressive way, and if you accept the proposition that in order to deal with that we can’t
      simply rely on our own power and resources, but we have to cooperate with our friends and our
      friends are going to be the people with whom we share values as well as interests, it’s going to
      require a coherent strategy, and it’s going to require a strategy that can be sustained and
      justified and explained to the American people over a period of time. It’s not just a case of
      periodically ordering a strike on this terrorist leader or that. And it certainly isn’t something
      that’s going to be possible if you have a leader who is constantly haranguing and in effect
      threatening our traditional allies because of some belief that they’re taking advantage of us and
      not paying the proper price for our protection of them. And that too I think is missing from some of
      these efforts to make sense out of what Trump says or to recast his previous record and fit the
      pieces together into something that is more coherent than I think it actually was. You mentioned the
      thing about personality, just to take one example, some people who are making the case for Trump
      say, “Well, he would be a consistent friend of Israel, and the Biden administration has put pressure
      on Israel,” and there is truth in that. And we can talk about whether that’s the right thing to do
      or not, but what is the basis for Trump’s supposed affinity for Israel? I mean, it seems that it has
      to do with his affinity for a particular leader of that country for various reasons. And if that
      leader is gone and he’s replaced by someone who’s different or comes from a different party, is
      Trump going to have the same attachment to that leader and be willing to back that leader no matter
      what? I don’t see any reason for believing that. Because again, Trump’s view of the world and his
      policies seem to be rooted very much in these personal judgments. And those personal judgments seem
      to have to do almost entirely with how those people treat him and how they talk to him and whether
      they flatter him. That’s not the foundation for an enduring American grand strategy, to the
      contrary.

      That’s awfully well said, that last one. You really put together I think one of the fundamental
      problems with Trump. People, like me, are interested in the somewhat the ideology, the political
      theory underlying it, and America First, and I’m very appalled by that. So I probably focus on that
      more than just the pure transactional and erratic and undisciplined character, and the failure to
      even understand that you should have a strategy. I mean, the American First strategy would also be
      very bad. So if the choice is going to be a mixture of a very bad international strategy and no
      international strategy probably mixing together in the Oval Office there with Trump. But let me ask
      you one last question and then I’ll let you go, but you’ve studied American politics and some of the
      interaction of US politics and foreign policy, international relations over a long time. You’ve
      studied it for a long time, but you’ve studied it in practice over the last century and during the
      Cold War, and you’ve written about that. I was talking to someone actually earlier today about this.
      I was consistent with what I just said, maybe the better critique of Trump for the American public
      is a little less the America First thing, or even the tariffs, though I think that probably has some
      potency, or the explaining the knock-on effects of deserting Ukraine, which I do think people have a
      sense of, so I think that’s all important. But also just the pure riskiness of his being so erratic
      and impulsive and not understanding that you need to have a functioning foreign policy and a
      functioning administration that carries out a policy somewhat consistently and so forth. And I was
      wondering if you think in your reading of American history since World War II, I guess, does the
      charge that someone who wants to be president, Trump’s a little different who wants to be president
      again, but it’s too risky? Does that work politically? I mean, is that something that Harris should
      be saying or is it better to stay on the particulars of the terrorists and Ukraine and so forth? I
      kind of have the feeling that there’s something that people could see there. They kind of have a
      common sense view I take it that you can’t run major organizations this way, can’t run the
      government this way. The world’s a volatile place. You can get into wars by trying to be erratically
      too dovish and you can give up a lot by being erratically too hawkish. People have a sense of how
      that would work or do they? I mean, I guess is the risky charge a sensible thing politically? I’m
      curious for your judgment on that.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      It’s an interesting question, and I haven’t thought about it in quite that way, but just as you were
      speaking, if you think about the history of our domestic politics and presidential politics in
      particular over the post-World War II period, there are at least a couple of examples where you had
      candidates on both sides, on one side or the other who were perceived rightly or wrongly as being
      excessively risky. And Barry Goldwater is one of the reasons he lost by the margin that he did to
      LBJ, I think, was that Johnson and others probably accurately portrayed Goldwater as too risky
      because he was cavalier about the use of nuclear weapons among other things. And then of course, a
      few years later, you also have George McGovern who’s portrayed, and again, I think there’s some
      reason to believe that this was accurate, as someone who was too risky because he was going to pull
      America back from its traditional commitments and not just get out of Vietnam but pull out of our
      alliances. Now whether that was fair or not, those are two candidates who were successfully
      portrayed by their opponents as risky. But that worked because of the sort of backdrop and the
      public perception at the time of the nature of the world as being risky but risky in a… How to say
      it, in a somewhat more stable way that we were locked in this Cold War and it was very dangerous and
      therefore we didn’t want to make radical moves in one direction or another. Now, I’m not sure about
      the perception. It may be that people see danger here and danger there, but don’t see it in a more
      coherent way. It may be in part as a result of that, that some people are tempted by the belief that
      if we just sort of pull back from it, we can insulate ourselves from it. So the claim that someone
      is risky because they’re threatening to make radical changes in policy may not work if people don’t
      believe in the threat and therefore don’t see the danger of having someone who might do that. I
      think that’s a real failure on the part of our leadership up to this point. I was just looking at
      the Commission on National Defense Strategy that came out over the summer, and normal people don’t
      read those things and they certainly don’t read them every time they come out, but if you do read
      them, it’s quite hair-raising. And these are serious sober people from both political parties who
      are saying, I think in the first sentence, we face the most dangerous international environment
      since the end of the second World War. Therefore, we need to increase defense spending considerably.
      We need to make serious changes in strategy and all the things that follow from that. I don’t think
      that most people in this country see the world in that way. And part of the reason is that I don’t
      think our leaders have successfully conveyed that message and that heightens the danger I think.
      Because, well, just taking the defense spending as an example, we’re headed towards 3% of GDP, far
      lower than the average over the course of the Cold War. If you believe, as I’m inclined to do, as
      this report suggests that we need to increase to say 5% of GDP or 6% of GDP, that’s a huge political
      struggle there. And there are all kinds of consequences. Are you going to cut spending here, are
      you’re going to increase taxes? If you believe it’s necessary to make that change in strategy
      because of judgment about the character of the international environment, you’re going to have to
      persuade people of that. You’re going to have to start by portraying that external environment in a
      way that’s accurate and is going to be frightening to people, but also coherent. And that makes
      clear why and how we can and need to respond in a coherent and stable and sober way. And on that
      score, again, I think Trump fails utterly because he doesn’t see the world in that way. He doesn’t
      speak that language, and I don’t think he’s going to pursue the kinds of policies that will make
      that possible over a period of time. So he’s risky, but maybe there’s something about the way people
      are viewing the world, which doesn’t make it clear just how risky he is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      No, that’s really well said. Our friend Eric Edelman was Vice Chairman of the Commission and really
      co-author of that report and has testified on it before Congress. And I think I need to go read the
      whole… Really read it. I’ve just looked at the kind of headlines of it and maybe have a conversation
      with Eric, I guess about it at some point in the future. But the paradox, I guess is in a political
      way for Harris thinking about the next five weeks is a version of what follows what you’ve said,
      which is, I mean, any incumbent administration sort of wants to portray things as getting better.
      I’d say the Biden administration in particular though is not… They’ve done some, might be pretty
      good things. You think on China and I think on Ukraine, we both think on Ukraine and so forth,
      actually supporting Israel, but they certainly haven’t made one of their centerpieces of their
      rhetoric that it’s a very dangerous world out there and we need to do more than we’ve been doing.
      And these are real… It’s a little bit more of a reassuring, we’re doing, everything’s fine. NATO is
      stronger than ever, and we don’t have troops in harm’s way. And that undercuts, of course, the
      argument that you’re making here and that we’re saying that Harris might make or that a responsible
      leader would make about alerting the American people to the danger. It’s not totally… Obviously it’s
      not… You can have some of both, obviously and Cold War leaders did that a lot. I was thinking about
      Bush in ’88 who had, I think there was an actual debate in the Bush campaign in ’88 about should
      they take credit for the improvement under Reagan and for the fact that Gorbachev was clearly
      leading the Soviet Union in a somewhat different direction than his predecessors had. And the fact
      that the world seemed safer by November ’88 when George H.W. Bush was running to succeed Reagan,
      then it had probably in ’80 or ’84, maybe a little less concerned about things blowing up,
      literally. On the other hand, they also thought, A, the world remains dangerous and B, politically,
      we need to make the case that it’s dangerous. That’s why you need Bush experienced tough foreign
      policy and not Michael Dukakis. And so they had that famous bear in the woods ad, do you remember?
      Which was a pretty kind of Cold War, be worried about the Russian Bear ad. But I think responsible
      leaders, probably from Truman on through Reagan and Bush and really Clinton sort of, and into post-
      Cold War sort of had to balance this, we need to be strong, we need to be the pillar of this whole
      international order or things could get very, very dangerous. And there are people out there trying
      to make it more dangerous at the bear in the woods. But on the other hand, I’m the incumbent
      president, so things have gotten a little better. I feel like Biden’s maybe aired a little bit more
      on the—

      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      …Things are getting better side of it. And it puts Harris in a slightly tricky position here, I
      think.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Right, yeah. Two things. One, there is the rhetorical issue and then there the concrete issue, I’m
      thinking particularly of defense spending. And yes, on the rhetorical side there is a desire to say
      things are getting better and there is obviously going to be a desire on the part of the opponent to
      say, oh, the world’s going to hell in a hand basket and it’s because of this administration. Well,
      the world may be going to hell in a hand basket, but it’s not primarily because of what we’re doing
      or not doing. It’s because of these external factors and the character of these regimes. So this
      claim that things are getting better or the inclination to say that also frames the problem in the
      wrong way as a short-term thing that can be brought under control and we can go back to business as
      usual. And my own view is that’s not an accurate presentation, and it’s not solely or primarily
      because of any failings of the current administration. It’s because of the way these other powers
      are evolving. And I believe I said this in one of our prior conversations that Biden had an
      opportunity, there was a moment there after the start of the Ukraine war, after the beginning of the
      Russian invasion, when he could conceivably have gone to Congress and said, as Truman did after the
      North Korean invasion of the South in June, 1950, “This is an extremely dangerous, a newly dangerous
      situation, and we have enemies and so on, and therefore we need to make dramatic increases in the
      resources that we devote to defense among other things over an extended period of time.” And I think
      he probably would’ve gotten support for that from people on both sides of the aisle. Now, they did
      wind up increasing the amounts of money that they’re spending, but they have not made what I would
      consider to be the necessary long-term, upward adjustments in the slope of that curve. And it’s kind
      of late to do that. It requires… because we’re in a different situation… It’s not like during the
      Cold War where, again, I think people had a general sense of what the problem was. It’s a new danger
      or a new emergent danger that has to be explained and the various pieces of it and how they fit
      together and why they’re threatening has to be articulated in order then to get to the practical
      question of what it is that you’re going to do about it. And I do worry about the Harris
      administration. I don’t want to leave the impression that I think they’re going to be great, and I’m
      highly confident of everything she’s going to do. I’m not, and I’m worried about it on, for lack of
      a better term, on the soft side, I’m worried about the somewhat more left-leaning portions of the
      Democratic Party that are not going to be inclined to increase defense spending, that are suspicious
      of foreign entanglements and so on. Biden probably deserves more credit than he gets for not being
      right in the mainstream of his party that he was to the right of the center of that party. And he
      kind of brought it along with him on all of these issues to some extent on Ukraine, certainly on the
      Middle East. And I’m not confident that Harris coming next is going to continue to exert that kind
      of pressure. And I’m concerned that there will be counter pressures from other parts of the
      Democratic Party, foreign policy establishment who will be trying to push her. That’s the sort of
      Obama 2.0 scenario that I’m concerned about. The big unknown there is Harris herself, and partly
      because the things that she said, they’re fine, but they are kind of rote recitations of standard
      view or standard ways of explaining what’s going on in the world and what needs to be done. But what
      exactly are her views and convictions? To what extent does she share Biden’s, I don’t want to say
      black and white, but somewhat more ideological view of the world. To what extent does she share his,
      really share his gut instinct regarding American leadership? I don’t know. It’s quite possible that
      she’s received an extraordinary education in the last four years because of where she’s been
      sitting. And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I
      think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that
      she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they’ve been, in my view, for the most part, the right
      thing to say. Are those now her genuine convictions and are they strong enough to enable her to push
      back against what I think is coming her way if she wins, which is we need to stabilize relations
      with China, we need to get a ceasefire because somehow we’re going to get a peace settlement in the
      Middle East. Or I’m not sure exactly where that would come out on Ukraine. That we don’t know, but I
      think the variance there is much narrower than the variance if it’s Trump. And the downside, in my
      view, is much worse and more dramatic on the Trump side than it is on the Harris side. So if she
      wins, we’ll be back to sort of normal debates about policy, foreign policy, defense policy, and I
      think we can survive that and live with that. If Trump wins, we’re in a whole different world. In my
      view, it’s likely to be a much darker one.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      Oh, that’s good if somewhat bracing thing to end on. I would say with Harris, I think also the fact
      that she’ll be sort of a next generation candidate who doesn’t have a very well established foreign
      policy record, unlike Biden, is both an opportunity and of course a risk. I mean, as you say, we
      don’t quite know where she’ll go and who will influence her, but she might also read your article in
      Foreign Affairs and say, yes, that’s a model for how to go forward. Whereas in a way, Biden wasn’t
      quite interested in new models for how to go forward. He was interested in strengthening the old
      alliances, which was better than destroying the old alliances. So that was good. So I don’t know,
      the Harris thing will be an interesting actual thing to watch and to try to influence, I suppose.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, I don’t know about you and we’re not as old as Biden, but we’re not as young as we used to be.
      Yes, there is an inclination to kind of fall back on the modes of thought and the ideas that you’ve
      had. And it’s true. People who are newer to the scene and newer in dealing with these problems may
      have the advantage of being able to consider a wider array of possibilities than a more experienced
      leader might. There again, it depends partly on the extent to which that person has developed
      genuine convictions. I’m thinking about Truman in this regard. Someone who was not seen as a
      heavyweight, had some experience on foreign and defense policies from being in the Senate, but
      nothing like what he was thrust into when Roosevelt died, but turned out to have reflexes. He had
      the right kind of reflexes, which were sort of tough-minded. And he also was surrounded by a bunch
      of people who were experienced and did have a realistic and tough assessment of the world. And that
      combination moved him in the right direction. And in Harris’s case, both are uncertain, but at least
      based on what she’s been saying, for the most part, it’s hopeful. Whereas based on everything Trump
      has said about foreign policy, to the extent that it’s coherent, and if you actually read the
      transcripts of some of these interviews, they’re not coherent at all. I think would lead to the
      conclusion that what he really believes is the America First, isolationist, protectionist, anti-
      immigration view that I suspect would emerge triumphant if he gets another crack at the White House.
