      What to Look For in the Home Stretch October 23, 2024 (Episode 276) Filmed October 22, 2024

      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again today by
      my old friend, Ron Brownstein, Senior Editor at The Atlantic , Senior Political Analyst for CNN.
      We’ve done a few of these conversations— And just to summarize, one of the best political analysts.
      I won’t say the best, we have too many other friends. One of the very best political analysts in
      America today, electoral analyst. And we’re, what are we, two weeks exactly before the election?
      You’re going to explain everything to us, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, as best you can explain a race that is close enough that you’re probably not going to know
      going into election day, who’s going to win. By the way, we’ve done a few of these conversations,
      but our conversations about presidential politics began before the 1988 race with Michael Dukakis
      and George H.W. Bush. So, we’ve both been watching this for a while, and one of the things that
      makes this so, well, fraught is obviously the stakes in the election, in terms of the divergence and
      the pathways forward for the country. But also, this kind of, the number of swing states has shrunk
      so much since those earlier days. The campaigns are fighting out in really half as many or possibly
      a third as many states as they used to, but what’s left is really closely balanced on the knife’s
      edge and is just nerve wracking for them all the way across each. I saw yesterday in the events that
      Vice President Harris did with Liz Cheney, which we’re very good and we’ll talk about, at one point,
      she said, “Yeah,” she kind of acknowledged, “Yeah, I do wake up in the middle of the night pretty
      much every night,” and I’m guessing she is not alone in having that sentiment two weeks out.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      There’s so much to talk about. It’s so close. And so, what’s the landscape that creates that it
      being so close? It both looks so much like 2016 and 2020. So much unlike the elections when we first
      met in 1988 and ’92 and ’96 and so forth. And it’s both so something totally new, an ex-president
      running for the third time, something that hasn’t happened in way in over a century. And then, the
      first Black woman candidate for president. So, it’s both an amazing mixture of total novelty and no
      novelty at all, it seems to me.

      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, you’re such a good analyst of the electorate, and you became sort of so well known for
      explaining how the electorate breaks down. So, give us the basic. What is the breakdown, the basic
      breakdown of the electorate in 2024? How does it compare to the last couple of presidentials and how
      does it compare with the way it was before?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. To the point of when we started doing this, I started in the ’84 campaign, you might’ve been
      even a little before that. And at that point, white voters without a college degree were the
      dominant block in the American electorate, as they had been all through American history. I mean,
      from Jefferson’s yeoman farmer to FDR and Walter Reuther’s guy on the line, as late as ’84, white
      voters without a college degree were two-thirds of all voters according to the census data. And I’m
      just looking here, college educated white voters were about one in six, so 16%, which meant that
      people of color were about 16%. So, it was basically two-thirds whites without a college degree, and
      the remaining thirds split about evenly between college whites and people of color, who at that
      point were mostly Black voters, right? Now, since then, we’ve had a very steady process of
      demographic transformation of the electorate. Whites without a college degree have declined about
      two to three points every four years as a share of both eligible and actual voters. And the
      difference has been made up by steady growth among the other two groups. There’s some perfect—almost
      too perfect—historical symbolism in that 2008, the election that first elected Barack Obama, made
      him the first African-American President in American history, that was the first election in which
      non-college whites, the blue collar whites fell below a majority of the voters. And they have
      continued to fall since, even as Trump has generated enormous turnout among them, right? Turnout has
      also risen in response among the other groups that are much more resistant to Trump. And so, the
      composition of the electorate has been affected really by the composition of the population. I mean,
      the two factors that, we basically have two factors that decide what the actual electorate on
      election day looks like. One is turnout among the various groups, and two, is the presence, the
      relative presence of those groups in the population overall. So, that general pattern, which has
      taken us from the eighties to now is still holding between ’20 and ’24. I’m publishing new data,
      literally today, from the great Bill Frey, a demographer who probably has focused more on the
      changing structure of the electorate than I think anybody out there. As Donald Trump said, “We’ve
      never seen anything like this.” But Bill has put out his new projections of what the eligible
      electorate will look like in 2024, and what it shows is that those non-college whites are again
      declining another two points, with college whites and people of color each rising by about a point.
      So, what does that mean? Non-college whites, I said they were two-thirds of the voters when Reagan
      won his landslide in 1984, they’ll probably be under 40% of all the voters this time. I mean, that
      is a big change over our lifetime. By the way, one way to measure that change, Donald Trump in 2016
      and 2020 won about the same share of those blue collar whites as Reagan did back in ’84, roughly
      two-thirds of them. But that showing among the blue collar whites was sufficient to get Reagan to
      59% of the vote. It got Trump about 47% of the vote both times, which shows you the power of
      demographic change. And then, the college whites are growing and the people of color are growing. I
      wouldn’t be surprised if we see an electorate that is somewhere around 38 to 40% of the voters,
      depending on which data source you use, will be the whites without a degree, and the people of color
      will be just under 30, and the college educated whites will be just over 30. And very importantly,
      before I filibuster you too long, Bill Frey’s analysis also looked at the state by state of the
      swing states, and the decline in the share of eligible voters for non-college whites is even greater
      than the national average in Michigan and Wisconsin, where they are largely being replaced by
      college whites. It is less than the national average in Pennsylvania where they’re mostly being
      replaced by non-whites. And that could be, normally, these changes that we’re describing are kind of
      glacial. They affect the electorate over decades in the way that we were talking about from Reagan
      to Trump. But this year, everything is so closely balanced. Who knows if a slight shift in Michigan
      and Wisconsin from non-college whites mostly voting Republican, to college whites that are now
      mostly voting Democratic, that could be enough to tilt a state. I kind of feel like we’re in a
      butterfly effect election where even the smallest flutter could transform the environment.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, give us the rough breakdown as far as we gather them, and some of the data, of course, conflicts
      a tiny bit … But of these, each of these big categories, both I’d say college whites, non-college
      whites, people of color, and then men and women, I would say, I mean, based on what’s the relevant
      vote share of Trump, Biden or Republican?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Right. And by the way, I should mention that real quick. Frey’s analysis is that women, in every
      election I believe since 1980, women have turned out at a higher rate than men. There are also more
      women in the eligible voter pool than men, right? So, women, he projects will be about 52% of all
      eligible voters in 2024, which would make it pretty likely that they’re going to be about 53% of all
      actual voters, right? Because, again, it’s the share in the population times the turnout, and women
      are a bigger share of the population and they turn out at higher rates. And by the way, that turnout
      gap between women and men is larger for younger people than older people. Men over 65 actually vote
      at a higher rate than women over 65. But among younger people, the turnout rate, the turnout gap is
      even more tilted toward women. And the other thing that is relevant to that, just the last one we
      should probably talk about, is that Gen Z were about 1 in 10 eligible voters in 2020. This time,
      they’re going to be 1 in 6. So, even if their turnout … Gen Z is basically ’97 to 2014, so these are
      big elections. 2024 and 2028 are big elections when a lot of them come in, age into the electorate.
      But 18 million people have turned 18 since 2020, Bill Frey calculates. And with those, they’re not
      going to be 16% of the actual voters because they don’t turn out as much as older people. But there
      will be five, six, maybe 8 million more Gen Z voters this time than last time just because their
      sheer numbers of eligibles is growing so fast. So, where are we?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, give us the breakdown of the, yeah, the categories by education, by gender, and by age, more
      or less.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I mean, I don’t think we have a great consensus in polling, but by and large, you see Trump about
      where he was among white voters without a college degree four years ago. And that, in some ways, is
      a victory for Kamala Harris.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Which is where?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Which is probably, he’s somewhere around 63 to 65, and she’s somewhere around 33 to 36 among—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But just because, so in 2020, which I guess you do know better than what’s going to happen in two
      weeks.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Trump was close to two-thirds of whites without a college degree.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. But they’re a little bit below two-thirds. Biden did a little better, right? I mean, the
      various data sources we have don’t entirely agree. But generally speaking, Hillary Clinton only won
      about 30% of these non-college whites, and Biden got that up, depending on your source, somewhere
      around a third, 33? Maybe 34. I’m trying to remember what the AP VoteCast number was.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And college whites?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Now, the college whites, again, they improved from Hillary to Biden. Hillary, still, I’m trying to
      recall, Hillary, I think still narrowly lost them. Biden narrowly won them. In the exit polls, he
      won them by bigger margins in other data sources like Catalyst and the Pew validated voter’s study.
      This time, I think Harris is on track to do better among college whites. She almost certainly will
      do even better than Biden did among college educated white women, right?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And how big is the gender gap? I mean, it’s been going on a long time, and some people make it sound
      like it’s even bigger than ever, but I’ve seen some other data that shows…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      No, right now, it doesn’t look bigger than ever in most polls. I mean, the exception of John Kerry
      in 2004, Democrats in this century have won women voters by somewhere between 11 to 13 points pretty
      consistently. Biden pushed that up a little higher, maybe to 15 points. Harris might push it up a
      little more than that. And it is possible that Trump will run a little better with men than he did
      last time, because you are seeing improvements certainly among Latino men. He is going to run better
      with Latino men than he did last time, maybe a little bit better with Black men, and probably
      somewhat better among young white men, younger white men, that he’s put a lot of effort into
      courting. I would not be surprised if Harris wins women by more than Biden did and loses men by more
      than Biden did. Celinda Lake, the Democratic pollster, has a rule of thumb that says, “Democrats win
      when they win women by more than Republicans win men.” In point of fact, if you look at the data
      from Bill Frey, they don’t actually have to do that. In every swing state, women will be a majority
      of the electorate. So, what does that mean? That means if Harris wins women by as much as Trump wins
      men, she can win the states. That is easier said than done in the Southeast states where a lot of
      white women are also evangelical Christians and don’t vote for Democrats in the same way that they
      do in the North. It may be more doable in the Southwest than it will be in North Carolina and
      Georgia for her. But certainly, if you’re looking at the former blue wall states, I always put that
      former in there for reasons we could talk about in a minute, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
      those are states where, in 2022, the first election after Dobbs, the Democratic gubernatorial
      candidates all ran better among college educated and non-college educated white women than Biden had
      done two years earlier, right? And that would seem to me a real opportunity for her, especially
      among the college white women. The visits she did Monday with Liz Cheney to Chester County in
      Pennsylvania, Oakland County and Michigan, where she was and I was at the rally just two days
      earlier, and Waukesha, Wisconsin, that was a guided missile, a precision guided missile aimed at the
      places and the people that I think represent her best chance to improve over Biden in 2020, and
      offset what could be some losses elsewhere, particularly in the inner cities and the smaller rural
      places.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But the improvements, what’s so striking is, I mean, they’re at the margin because the polarization
      is so deep that in fact, you see, I think I saw just the latest, one of the polls recently, but this
      is true across many polls, that basically Trump is holding 92, 94, 95% of his voters in 2020.
      Harris, though a very different person than Biden in certain ways, is holding 92, 94, 95 of the
      Biden voters. Even 2016, there was 90 plus percent. I mean, the number of voters who are in one camp
      or another, that’s really a new phenomenon, right? I mean, when you and I, the first campaign you
      came to was ’84, where there was a 20 point win by Reagan?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I mean, we went from, I mean, I was just trying about this the other day. In 1928, Herbert Hoover
      won 59% of the vote, and then four years later, FDR won 59% of the vote. I mean, we don’t do that
      anymore. I mean, we are in total trench warfare, John Sides and Lynn Vavreck and their
      collaborators, the political scientists in their books have kind of, I think, popularized the
      phrase, “the calcification of American politics,” where you’re talking about trench warfare, very
      small shifts from election to election. Now, in this campaign, we might see some shifts that just
      kind of add up to an offsetting, leaving us very close to where we have been. I mean, I do think—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But am I right that the shift— just if I could drop—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      … Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The shifts tend to be shifts, and even in the more in the same direction, so to speak. It’s not like
      reverting back to fluidity. It’s like the college, non-college gap is going to be maybe even a
      little bigger than it was, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. Yeah. Look, I think that Harris’, I mean Harris’ best … What is Harris’ pathway to victory? If
      you look at it demographically, it’s to minimize the losses among Black and Latino men. Basically
      hold the line as much as possible among non-college whites, maybe by doing a little better among the
      women to offset what could be a little decline among the men. And then, to grow, to increase among
      the college whites, particularly the women. I mean, I think a scenario for her to win would be to
      basically keep down the losses among Black and Latino men, run even to Biden among college white
      men, improve a few points among college white women, and likewise improve a little among non-college
      white women to offset losses among non-college white men. It’s an election where, this is an
      election where gender and education gaps are widening, and racial and generational gaps are somewhat
      narrowing, right? I mean, that’s kind of the interesting… We’re looking at the education and gender
      lines within each racial group kind of really looming as the critical variable here.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And within the age groups, as you said earlier, especially among young people, that was not
      predicted—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. Among young people.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … 10 years ago, I don’t think, right? I mean…
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      No. I was having this conversation with somebody a few days ago. Five years ago, I think certainly,
      and this is an important development that portends our politics, staying very closely competitive.
      Five years ago, I would’ve said that Republicans would have obviously struggled more with young
      women than young men, but also would’ve faced a lot of problems with young men because of the views
      they were expressing on all sorts of social issues relating to inclusion and equity. But now, Donald
      Trump, there are some polls where he’s running even among young men overall, and maybe he won’t be
      able to do that, but he is going to run very competitively among men under 30. He’s almost certainly
      going to win white men under 30. And yes, she may have historic margins among young women, and
      again, young women vote more than young men, especially young men of color who are expressing
      interest in Trump in polls, yes. But his ability to fracture the electorate along lines of gender
      and education, some of it in backlash to him, some of it in attraction to him, has been very
      powerful, has reconfigured the electorate in a way, kind of a resorting. Now, I feel like if you
      look at the evidence in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, that this resorting since 2016 has
      resulted, until now, in a net advantage for Democrats, which have won almost everything in those
      states. But overall, on a national basis, this resorting is allowing Republicans to withstand the
      slight election-to-election shifts. And as I said in the composition of the voter pool, that is
      shrinking the group where they’ve done the best, the non-college whites, and increasing the presence
      of the groups where they have struggled the most in the Trump era, college whites and non-white
      voters.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Just the stability as you said, the calcification, the trench warfare character. It all is so
      amazing because if someone had come down from Mars and said, “Okay, we’re going to have this ex-
      president governs in a chaotic … Wins, a very narrow, slightly flukish, electoral college victory,
      governs in a chaotic way, loses re-election, insurrection, January 6th, impeached but not convicted.
      Indictments, then gets re-nominated and is more Trumpy than he was four or eight years ago, I think
      we can say, or more expressly, more reckless in terms of violating various norms and conventions and
      so forth.” On the one hand. And then were going to have the first Black female candidate on the
      other side, after the guy who had won the nomination steps aside in a totally unprecedented way in
      American politics. Biden leaves, Harris comes in. We would’ve, I think in a normal world I would
      say, “Oh my God, that’s totally chaotic.” Who knows. Someone could be up 10 and then down 10, no one
      knew Harris. Trump both had won once and lost narrowly once, won narrowly once, lost narrowly once.
      But now with January 6th, wouldn’t there be a huge turnover or resistance to him? And instead we’ve
      had all this novelty, you might say, and an election for the ages kind of thing. Biden getting out
      so late and so forth. And then at the end of the day it’s gone from Biden drifting down to minus
      four or so nationally. He gets out, Harris goes back up to plus two or three, maybe three at the top
      now, maybe two nationally. And you look at the two lines on a chart, this unbelievable chaos, but it
      all doesn’t seem to affect the electorate much.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, and a bunch of polls out today have her still three or four nationally. Four seems exuberant,
      but maybe three. I guess I am a big Sides-Vavreck “calcification” devotee. And I will give you my
      own little gloss on it, because in some ways I think stuff I’ve written over the years relates to
      this too. First of all, because of this calcification, it’s important to note, we’re talking about
      before the number of contested states has shrunk to historic levels. 40 states have now voted the
      same way in at least the past four consecutive presidential elections, which is a higher share of
      the states voting the same way than even in the four consecutive elections that FDR won. And of the
      10 that have split at any time, four of them aren’t really competitive. There are states that Obama
      won at one point but has since moved very securely into the Republican camp, Indiana, Iowa, Florida
      and Ohio. So we’re down to six states that have flipped somewhere in the last few years, Michigan,
      Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the Rust Belt, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona and the Sun Belt,
      they’re the switchers. And then there’s Nevada, which has voted Democratic four straight times, but
      is on the knife’s edge. So first of all, the result of this demographic stability is a shrinking of
      the battlefield. I view the underlying cause of this stasis to be the transformation of our
      coalitions, to coalitions that once were organized more around class are now organized more around
      culture. And I wrote in 2012 before Trump came on the scene after the election, looking at those
      results, I said that our politics now divides between a coalition of transformation and a coalition
      of restoration. That the Democrats rallied the people and the places that were most comfortable with
      the way the country is changing demographically, culturally, and economically. All the cherries on
      the slot machine line up. Largely the people who are comfortable with a more diverse society in
      which gender roles are evolving are also generally comfortable with the transitions in the economy.
      And on the other side are the voters who feel most threatened or marginalized by all of these
      changes. The transformation to a more information age based economy, changing gender roles and
      family patterns. And also just the sheer amount of demographic change that we’re living through that
      Obama came to symbolize. And if your affinity to one party or the other is based on your attitude
      about these fundamental evolutions in what it means to be an American, it’s much harder to change
      that for current circumstances of any kind, like the economy … Both things are true. It is on the
      one hand remarkable that Trump is as competitive as he is given January 6th, multiple felony
      indictments, felony convictions, civil judgments on fraud and sexual assault, as you point out the
      visible evidence of his decline, not quite as pronounced as Biden, but unmistakable. The turn toward
      more overtly authoritarian, racist and just plain vulgar behavior. And so many Democrats, like
      people I ran into in Michigan, I was like, “How is this still an issue after that?” Well, you can
      look at it the other way. A significant majority of Americans, particularly working class voters
      across racial lines, say they are not better off because of the policies of the Biden administration
      and say that the policies of Trump helped them economically, whether that bears out or not, that the
      policy of Trump helped them economically more than the policies of Biden. So you can look at that
      and say, “Well usually when that happens, the party in power gets waxed. How is Harris as
      competitive as she is with all that?” And I think it is because our fundamental alignment is based
      on culture, not class, based on the competing definitions of who is a legitimate American, what it
      means to be an American, and that there’s only very little movement around the margins in a world
      separated by those views.

      And the candidates just matter less, which is something that people like me, maybe you too, who love
      politics, don’t like in a way. We love the idea that a candidate can run a great campaign or a
      strategist, Lee Atwater and James Carville and it makes a huge difference. But they swapped out
      Biden for Harris. Has there ever been a better test of, “Let’s swap out an incumbent president 50
      years in public office, white working class origins, Catholic appeals to that, and let’s swap him
      out for a Black woman from California who had never gotten a vote for president, actually.” She is
      the vice president, of course.

    text: |
      Right. Got out before—

      The campaigned bombed out in 2019. And unknown … I’m exaggerating, but little known certainly
      compared to Biden who’d been vice president years, you’d think huge variance. And the variance was
      actually the other way. Biden was too old, so she picked up some… But basically all the Biden voters
      are still for Harris with a tiny delta … Not tiny, but a small delta increase of those—

      In a certain way it’s kind of astonishing. And in other ways you say it’s totally explicable. If you
      believe in A, B, or C, or identify with A, B, or C, or D, E, and F, you’re not going to change your
      mind just because it happens that the 80-year-old president isn’t the candidate and the 59-year-old
      vice president is. You’re just going to stick with that team. And the same of course with Trump,
      right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, for the vast majority of Americans, that’s true. But I guess maybe I’m being acculturated to
      our modern system. It seems to me like a five-point increase for her relative to Biden is something.
      And there are a couple of things that we’re going to test. In many ways the groups that seem to be
      moving the most, that are probably going to change the most from last time are the college-educated
      white women and the non-college-educated, younger, Black and Latino men. We’re looking at the other
      groups. I’m not sure, is she going to do that much worse than Biden did with blue collar white men?
      He didn’t do great. And I don’t see evidence in the polls of a big decline. Could she do a little
      better than he did among the blue collar white women? Maybe. But I think it’s going to end up really
      close again to where we were. College white men, that’s a good wild card to me, man. That could go
      either way. She could do a couple points better or a couple points worse. They tend to be voters who
      would think that Trump ran the economy better, but they’re married to college white women, a lot of
      them, who are really not going to accept them voting for Trump. So it does broadly validate the
      Sides-Vavreck “calcification theory.” But especially in the states that I think she has the best
      chance to win, her best place to grow are college white women in the suburbs, many of whom are
      probably the targets of efforts that you have been part of on the last few years. And she has to
      defend her margins among everybody else more or less. And I do think you’re going to see a lot of
      polarization by place in this election. As I said, I was in Michigan over the last few days, and you
      really can see the basic structure of the race. And what I’m about to say is equally true for
      Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, although the minority population isn’t as big in Wisconsin. Basically
      Trump has a pincer movement going. On the one side, he is trying to just slightly improve among
      economically marginal non-white voters—men mostly—in the big cities. And then he is counting on the
      usual towering Trump country advantages for him in places outside of the major metros and pressing
      on Harris from both ends. And her best path to victory is to dent, blunt as much of that advance as
      she can in the central cities and grow in the white collar suburbs where Biden already improved over
      Hillary. So just the best example is the four suburban counties outside of Philadelphia, Hillary won
      them by about 180. Biden won them by over 290. 290,000 vote margin in those four counties. When you
      add it to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and its inner suburbs, those basically six counties gave Biden
      a margin of over 900,000 votes. Now, Harris might have to do even a little better than that in those
      places because it is likely to me that the Scranton and Eries of the world will vote even a little
      more heavily for Trump than they did last time. But if she posts a 950,000 or 975,000 vote margin in
      the two major population centers, that would be her best chance. I’m not sure there are enough other
      people to overcome that. And the same thing in Michigan where you’ve got Detroit and some other
      midsize cities with large Black populations where her goal is to hold down the erosion and then grow
      even further in Oakland County, which is the big suburban county outside Detroit, white collar
      suburban county where she was on Monday with Liz Cheney, Kent County, which is outside around Grand
      Rapids, and the county with Ann Arbor. And to finish the kind of travel log here, in Wisconsin, it’s
      basically cut down the losses in the three big suburban counties outside Milwaukee, which are the
      most Republican leaning such counties anywhere left north of the Mason-Dixon line. Try to turn out a
      few more voters than Biden did in Milwaukee and then win the state mostly by pushing for
      astronomical margins in Dane County, which is Madison. State capital, flagship public university,
      big, I think biotech and financial growth there. That’s a place where we’ve gone from Hillary
      Clinton … I’m doing this off the top of my head, but I think it’s approximately right. Hillary
      Clinton winning about 70% of the vote there in 2016 in Dane County. Biden gets it to 75, Tony Evers
      in 2022 gets it to 79, and then that big state supreme court election last year, they get it to 83
      even as turnout is rising and it’s the only place in the state really adding people. So to me, the
      formula is very similar across all of the Blue Wall states. Now, this is harder in North Carolina
      and Georgia because more of those suburban whites, including the college whites, are cultural
      conservatives. Many of them are evangelical Christians. She can’t get the margins that she does in
      the northern tier battlefields. But this same model has worked for Democrats in the last few cycles
      in Arizona. This is exactly what we’re talking about. That’s why Arizona has flipped because the
      suburbs of Phoenix have become more friendly to Democrats. And if she wins, I think there is a
      pretty clear model for how she does so, and it will be white Republican leaning women, and maybe the
      younger women of all races entering the electorate, who provide her best chance to grow over Biden,
      as opposed to cutting the losses from Biden 2020. I just think that’s where she can grow the most.
      Maybe a little among some of those other groups we talked about, but probably not much.

      One of the things this travelogue, if you want to call it that, brings out so well, which I think is
      sometimes forgotten, is people talk so much about red states and blue states and geographical
      sorting, and of course there’s a lot of truth to that. When I got to Washington, I think in ’85, I
      think there were 26 states with a senator from each party. So more states than not had a Senate
      delegation with a Republican and a Democrat. Now there are, what, five? And it’s going down to after
      West Virginia votes, there’s going three states left, I think? It depends what happens in a couple
      of these [inaudible] of course.

      Wouldn’t it be two?

  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      If Brown, Tester and West Virginia all flip, now depending on … If Trump wins, Republicans might win
      the Senate seats in some combination of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      If they don’t.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      If they don’t, you could be down to Collins and Johnson as Republicans in the states that Democrats
      usually win for president and the only split delegations.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, and that changes so much the character of our politics, to have this … So I think it’s right
      to have uni-party states that affect two senators, majority of the House delegation, usually the
      governor’s from the same state, usually the presidential candidate carries the same state. So that’s
      very different from the politics of even 40 years ago where Bush would routinely carry states with
      Democratic governors and vice versa and so forth. So the red state/blue state thing is real and
      important. But of course what’s also amazing is, I would call it the geographical sociology, geo-
      economics sociology within the states. The metro areas are as different from the rural areas within
      the states.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Exactly.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      More different than the states are from each other, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And the metro areas and the rural areas are as different in red states as they are in blue states.
      So Biden in 2020 was the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 to win all four of the big
      metros in Texas. But he still lost because the rural areas have gotten even more Republican. The
      interior parts of California, Oregon and Washington, sparsely populated, more timber and natural
      resources and farming, they’re overwhelmingly Republican. And as I said, the Metros and Texas, I
      think Salt Lake City. Didn’t Biden win Salt Lake City and Boise? I think he won the county with
      Boise in it, or was at least very … I’m a little short on my Idaho political history, but he was
      certainly competitive in Boise. Basically you can draw an imaginary beltway around every major city
      in the country and inside of it, Democrats are generally getting stronger, and outside of it,
      Republicans are getting more dominant. The challenge for Harris is that Trump is definitely seeming
      in the polls, in position to crack a little bit more of that center city dominance among nonwhite
      voters than she is likely to make any improvement among the rural ex-urban small town voters in
      Trump country. And therefore, that’s why my feeling is that these big inner suburbs, not the outer
      more white, sparsely populated, but the inner Panera land and Whole Foods land, that is where she
      has to go to grow her vote to offset any losses on either side of those places, the rural or the
      center city. And I have felt this way for months. I was at a family wedding earlier this year in a
      suburb of Philadelphia, and I was looking at the parking lot of a Panera with whatever, it was
      probably a Michael’s or all the things you would expect to find in a reasonably upscale mall. And
      there were people getting out of Teslas and Lexus SUVs, and I was thinking much like the Spanish
      Civil War, this is literally the front line, or maybe the last line of defense in the battle over
      democracy. Because I think if democracy gets saved, it’s going to be some combination of enough
      inner city voters of color and racially diverse, but much more affluent inner suburb voters who do
      it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I was in Pennsylvania myself last weekend, but it’s striking. People talk so much about the
      white working class and every newspaper sent out teams of reporters to go to white working class
      diners in 2017 and stuff.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, they should go to Panera’s too.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, but I think the reporting under, what’s been under-reported is white college—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Oh, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … Especially white college men are not, I mean there’s 50-50, they’re not 80-20, so it’s different
      from non-college, but they’re not all Democrats or liberals. And Trump, especially among the men,
      has actually held a lot of that vote and that’s what’s made him, of course, competitive in these
      states.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, yeah. I mean, they’re roughly a 50-50 constituency. I think some of the analysis had Biden
      winning them slightly, and that is a place where Democrats could do a little better. Or like I said,
      if you think, we’re in a world where gender and education are just so powerful in shaping the vote,
      so if you think of white, and now I used to do this all the time and I think I’ve probably done it
      for you on a previous session that we’ve had. You can draw like quadrants among white voters. Right.
      And so where everything lines up for Republicans are men who are non-college and they are
      overwhelmingly Republican. And then where everything lines up for Democrats are women who are
      college and they are becoming more Democratic. I mean, Kamala Harris will win those college educated
      white women by a lot more than Hillary Clinton did. Okay. But the conflicted groups are the ones
      where gender and education pull in the opposite direction. So you’ve got the non-college white women
      who I think are really critical in those blue wall states. They’re a very big share of the
      electorate in all of them. They’re more than a quarter of the voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and
      Wisconsin. Historically, most of them nationally vote Republican. Clinton is the only Democrat since
      1980 to win even a plurality of them. But those national numbers are inflated by what we were
      talking about before. Many of them in the South, many, many of them in the South are evangelical
      Christians. When you get to the Northern tier battlegrounds, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,
      Democrats historically have been able to run a little better among them than they do nationally,
      somewhere in the low to mid 40s. And I think if she can get to the low to mid 40s among those non-
      college white women, she’ll be hard to beat in those states. I mean, that could get her there. And
      then of course the other conflicted group is the one you’re talking about where gender and education
      pulling the opposite direction are the college white men. They tend to trust Republicans more on the
      economy. They like tax cuts and some of them, like the non-college men of all races respond to the
      kind of the macho Trump signaling about gender roles and this is a very dangerous time for men and
      all of that kind of stuff. But there Harris’s job is to try to stay as close to even as she can.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This whole conversation, of course, it’s just been taking up for granted that we’re at a one or two
      or three point race in the key states and that it’s all very much at the margins and, which again
      has not been the case always in the past. I mean—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      No, things can break. Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … Things broke open in the last week, right? I mean, things look even and [inaudible] won by nine.
      But you don’t expect, I mean just, that would be surprising, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      That would be sur— [inaudible]. So I think part of the problem, I mean, Harris has had, there’s no
      doubt that that Trump has won October more on television than in person, I think, and I think Harris
      was very late in making an important pivot. I mean, I wrote a story what 10 days ago saying that she
      was failing to articulate a sufficiently urgent case about Trump. To me that was really underscored
      by her big wave of media interviews when she went on Howard Stern, and The View , and the podcasts,
      and 60 Minutes , Stephen Colbert. Her overriding goal, the through line in all those interviews was
      basically personal reassurance, I thought, right? It was personal connection. It was basically her
      trying to say, I think primarily to women voters, I have lived your life so I get your life so I
      know what we can do to make your life better. But there was really no Trump messaging. I mean,
      there’s a little bit on abortion, but no consistent, much less urgent warning about what a second
      Trump term would mean. And what I wrote in the story was the canary in the coal mine of the danger
      this was presenting for Democrats—and this is still true—was that Trump’s retrospective job approval
      rating in both national and state polls was rising to a level that exceeded his actual approval
      rating at any time when he was president. And what that said to me—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And that exceeded any approval rating for the Biden-Harris administration of course.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes, totally, totally. And what that said to me is that people were judging Trump primarily through
      the lens, remembering Trump primarily through the lens of what they didn’t like about Biden,
      particularly inflation and the border and everything else, all of the other things that kept his
      approval rating from actually reaching 50 when people were living through the conditions that they
      were now looking back on fondly. All of that was fading from view and she was allowing it to fade
      from view. Meantime, Trump was pounding her on television with a message that said she’s soft on
      crime, soft on the border, extreme on transgender rights. She is an extreme cultural liberal who
      won’t keep you safe. And then of course in the rallies, his core message was immigrants are coming
      to kill you and she won’t stop them. Or as I sometimes put it, people who don’t look like you are
      coming to kill you and she won’t stop them. Bill, I thought one word was an incredibly revealing
      window into his strategy when he took this to its biggest extreme at an event in Wisconsin in early
      October, and he said, he talked about the threat that immigrants will cut your throat. He said,
      “They will come in your kitchen door and cut your throat.” He didn’t say they’ll come in the front
      door where a man might be. He didn’t say they’ll come in the living room where a man might be. He
      said they’ll come in the kitchen where I think especially in a lot of these households we’re talking
      about, the woman can envision herself alone preparing dinner. I’m not sure how many men are cutting
      the zucchini and the green peppers and the tomatoes in the kitchen. And it was his core message. She
      will not keep you safe, and she’s a cultural liberal. And her message was, I thought, very diffuse.
      Now that pivoted last Monday night in Erie when she started showing the videos of him, and now she
      is back to very aggressively and particularly the audience we’re talking about, to kind of suburban
      upper middle class America, reminding them that there’s more involved in re-electing Trump than
      cheaper gas and eggs. Did she wait too long? Did that add-on slot do too much damage in the way that
      they’re saying, well, we don’t think it’s moved that many voters and we don’t think we have to
      respond. I have heard that before. I think that was what the Dukakis campaign said about Willie
      Horton. So that was a turning point in a bad way for her, I think. It allowed Trump to gain the
      momentum and the upper hand, at least in driving the dialogue in these states. And now she is back
      and very clearly betting the ranch on enough people saying, this is too big a risk, even if I think
      it might be a little better for my bottom line, and we’ll see whether she got there too late or
      whether she can in fact rally enough people. Trump’s certainly giving her plenty of help on this
      front, right, with his behavior. The enemy from within doubling down on it. He thinks it turns out
      his base, it could also turn out a lot of high propensity college educated suburban voters to stop
      him.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You think it seems, I actually had an argument with someone this morning about this. I’m very
      interested. He said, look, I love what you guys have done to Republican voters against Trump and The
      Bulwark and all that. Nice, lovely Sarah, your friend, colleague, Sarah Longwell got to moderate the
      event with Liz Chaney and Vice President Harris and outside Philadelphia. But I wonder if it’s a
      mistake, this person who’s pro-Harris, this intelligent strategist said, because polling all shows
      that the economic message still is the most important and Harris is making progress and chipping
      away at Trump’s economic advantage, judgment on inflation. And management of the economy was not so
      overwhelmingly pro-Republican, is not now in the polls as it was two months ago, made up some of the
      damage you might say, done by Biden and inflation and so forth. And is this just reinforcing voters
      who already are with her? This is all in, “baked in,” I’ve heard that phrase so many times as you
      have in the last yeah, week or two, and I mean, I want since I, personally this is what moves me. I
      mean, I like the democracy message and the Dobbs message, which is a personal freedom message that’s
      related to a liberties message you might call it. And for that message, I think Republican
      validators can be useful because it sort of makes it not just a partisan attack, but a kind of
      country first attack. But I don’t know, maybe we just like this message and she is better off
      running tens of millions dollars more ads on her grandparents, healthcare, what am I trying to say?
      Generation, senior healthcare, that kind of stuff. I mean, it’s not my preference, but could it be
      right, I guess that’s what I, and what have you seen that makes you or is that even a trade-off? Can
      you do both? I mean—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, right. Well, first of all, I mean obviously as is usually the case in politics, it’s not
      absolute that one version is indisputably superior to the other. But I do think on balance that she
      is not going to win the election if voters are basically asking who is better for my bottom line?
      Now—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You can’t fix that this late, right? I mean—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      You can’t fix that this late. I mean, the overwhelming sense among voters, that the Biden
      administration failed them economically because of inflation, which has eclipsed all of his other
      legit accomplishments, this very strong job market, the increase in wages over the last couple
      years, the incredible wave of private sector investment triggered mostly in manufacturing, mostly in
      red counties, mostly in places in Trump country triggered by the Inflation Reduction Act and the
      infrastructure bill. All of those are real accomplishments. Most voters would thinkg that … would
      judge his economic record and thus his presidency really I think as a failure because inflation in
      the first few years, which is now more under control, but still cumulatively squeezing people quite
      a bit, has just alienated so many voters. And I think they have done a very good job of trying to
      counteract that verdict by encouraging voters to look forward and basically saying, who’s on your
      side, who will fight for you? And she has made progress on that. And I think part of her closing
      message has to be that Trump isn’t really fighting for you, but I guess if you force me to choose, I
      would say that if you keep this in a conventional frame, it’s hard for her to win when 60% of the
      country almost disapproves of the outgoing president. I think if we look back through the history we
      have with the modern history of polling, which basically goes back to 1948, a popular president
      cannot guarantee victory for their party when they leave. So like Eisenhower in ‘60 and Clinton in
      2000, but an unpopular president usually guarantees defeat like Truman in ‘52, Nixon. Well, Johnson
      in ‘68, right? I mean, Bush in a way—

    text: |
      Carter obviously.

      Carter. Well Carter, he lost himself.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Himself. But yeah.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah. So I’m saying if the president steps down and he’s popular—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      There’s no guarantee you’re going to win. I think the history so far is that the president steps
      down and he is unpopular, it’s pretty likely you’re going to lose, and therefore I think you have to
      enlarge the frame. You really have to enlarge the frame, and you can’t let the dominant image of
      Trump be that the economy was better and all of this other crazy stuff he talked about, did it
      really happen? Was it really that bad? We could live through it again and maybe he’ll get the border
      and the economy under control. I think allowing that to sit as much as they have is the reason
      they’re in the situation they’re in and allowing it to sit all the way to election day, I think in
      the end would’ve guaranteed that the underlying forces, the dynamic of disapproval of the outgoing
      president and the state of the country would’ve sealed their fate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      I mean, another Democrat said to me—and I have some sympathy with this—that, “Harris is winning the
      campaign, the candidate war and the campaign war—better campaign. Trump’s winning the paid media
      war, the advertising war.”
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Totally. That is such an important point. The week before the first debate, a Republican strategist
      said to me that, “If we win this election, it won’t be because of the interactions between Trump and
      Harris, either at the debates or in the day-to-day driving of the news cycles. If we win the
      election, it will be because we basically run the campaign against her that we’ve run against
      Democrats for senator and governor forever in these swing states, basically portraying them as an
      extreme cultural liberal who are soft on crime and immigration and won’t keep you safe.” It’s
      basically, like whatever craziness is happening around Trump, when he’s talking about Arnold
      Palmer’s junk or Hannibal Lecter, whatever is happening with Trump himself. That campaign, that ad
      campaign is like motoring forward. It’s The Terminator . It just keeps going every day. You can’t
      reason with it. You can’t bargain with it, as Michael Biehn said. I mean, it just keeps going. And
      if they beat her, that will be the principle reason why. Plus you can’t ignore that there are a lot
      of voters who are saying they are okay with this even more overtly racist, xenophobic, authoritarian
      version of Trump, and that is a challenge the country’s going to face going forward, whatever
      happens in this election. I think people may have thought that after 2020 Trump loses, the
      Republican Party would turn back in a more conventional direction. I’m not sure him losing this time
      does that. If he loses twice in a row, and I think even if he loses, he says it was stolen and he
      presents himself as the front-runner for 2028.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s a very good point. I mean, we can discuss that when you come back on after the election
      and we’ll know who’s won or we may not quite know who’s won, but we’ll know what’s happened, at
      least to a considerable degree. The—

      Yeah. I mean, can I interject just real quick? I mean, it turns out that Trumpism, while probably
      incapable of winning the national popular vote, is capable because of the, kind of the kinks in the
      electoral college and certainly the Senate, it is capable of remaining competitive even in a
      diversifying country. Now, eventually we could get to a point where that’s not true, where just the
      sheer decline in the voters that it’s relying on most, but if he can in fact broaden this sort of
      non-college populist coalition to include more non-college men of color, and you combine that with
      the advantage that the electoral college and especially the Senate for those small, those lightly
      populated, predominantly white Christian, rural, small states, it can stay competitive even if it
      can’t command a national majority, which is going to make it harder to build a kind of critical mass
      in the party that says, well, this is an absolute dead end.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So more technical question. You said Harris pivoted and she now shows the clips of Trump at the
      rally and now she’s going to Texas on Friday to highlight the abortion, reproductive rights, but
      also women’s maternal health kind of issues.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And she was with Cheney yesterday and doing the kind of democracy rule of law constitution themes
      quite effectively, I thought. But do you believe, what I can’t tell is, is her paid advertising
      doing that too though? Or I still see a fair number of ads that are pretty, soft isn’t quite fair,
      but kind of she’s middle class, she has a good economic agenda, she’ll help you with healthcare. And
      again, there are people who think that is in fact the war. That tests better.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      The super PAC has done a lot of that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And then they say—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And they’re getting some criticism.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, if you look and ask people, people like it better and my answer to that, but I don’t know if
      I’m right, is well, what tests better against some abstract poll whether you care the most about
      healthcare and they say, yes, I care. I care a lot about it. Wait a minute. Do you like this ad?
      Yes, I like it. Does it really change their vote though? That’s what I guess, I’m worried that
      they’re running a campaign that’s a little, I don’t know, data-driven is not quite the right word,
      but it’s a little bit, sort of the poll shows 78% healthcare and 64% this. So we’re going to do the
      healthcare ad, but that’s not quite the way politics works.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, the closest thing I think they’ve done in volume in their advertising are various versions of
      ads showing people that work for him saying he’s unfit to be president again.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And I don’t know if that’s pointed enough. But yeah, I mean a Democratic pollster told me, for
      example, the home healthcare thing is very popular. It’s very popular among women who are the
      primary caregivers in the sandwich generation. And certainly this would make, if you combine, I’m
      surprised she didn’t mention this yesterday because when she was asked about the sandwich
      generation. They’re proposing that you limit the share of your income that you have to spend on
      childcare to what … 7, 8% of your income would be. After that you would get federal tax breaks that
      passed as part of Build Back Better in the House in ‘21. She’s revised it, revived it and coupling
      that with this very significant proposal to have not Medicaid but Medicare pay for home healthcare
      and now with Medicaid, people have to spend down all their assets before they can get any of that
      help. Under Medicare, you don’t have to do that. So this is policy very targeted at middle-aged
      women, especially those without degrees who have less resources usually than those with degrees and
      are married to men with degrees. And yet Democratic pollsters told me that it doesn’t really move
      the needle. They love it, but if they think immigrants are coming to kill them and Trump will keep
      them safe, or if they have been convinced that Harris is going to let their school ship their kid
      out for a daytime sex change operation before they get back on the bus at three o’clock, that this
      isn’t enough to overcome it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Also to say the discount for promises is greater probably than the discount for fears. Yeah, well,
      they all promise things and they promised this before and promised that before. And so I think it’s
      a lot of swimming upstream when you promise a government program whereas maybe you’re swimming a
      little … Is downstream the right way to say it? When you’re sort of increasing—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      With the current.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Fear.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Well, look, like I said before, I think by many conventional metrics it is as remarkable that Harris
      is competitive as it is that Trump is as competitive, given how dissatisfied people are. We can
      argue about whether wages in fact in the last few years have exceeded the growth in prices, but most
      people feel like they are worse off because of inflation than they were before the pandemic. And she
      has effectively chipped away at that, kind of changed the frame a little bit by getting people to
      focus on the future and who will fight for you. “I’ll fight the drug companies, I’ll fight energy.”
      All of that has been effective and even after all of it, Trump still usually leads by 10 or 12
      points when people are asked who they trust to handle the economy and she does better on some other
      measures. I know we’re going to get calls or whatever the equivalent is, going to get comments,
      people saying, “Well, no, no, no, she’s better on inflation.” I think if you’re in a conventional
      frame, “Who is better on the economy?” She can’t get there. But this can fairly pre-present it and
      it is not an exaggeration to say, “This is not that. This is an election that implicates much
      bigger, broader questions about the future of America from a militarized effort to deport 11 million
      people to these open pledges to use the National Guard or the military against the enemy within and
      to weaponize the justice…” I go back to this interview he did with Time Magazine months ago where he
      said, “Yes, I believe I would be in my right as president to fire a US attorney who would not
      initiate an investigation of a specific person I tell them to investigate under any circumstances.”
      Arguing about home healthcare, obviously you have to do that and I know the political scientists who
      study this point out that around the world parties running against quasi-authoritarian parties
      always have this debate, this conundrum, “Do you run a normal campaign? Do you focus on the price of
      bread and eggs or do you run a campaign about this unique risk?” Think you have to do both. She’s
      done a lot of the first, now she’s finishing with the latter. We’ll see if it was too late. We’ll
      see if it’s enough and it may be there are just too many people in the country who are okay with
      this.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, that is a huge question and we’ll know more about that, I suppose, after the election.
      Two final questions for now. What would you ask…? This will come out tomorrow or Thursday, this
      conversation. What would you suggest people look for in the last 10 days in terms of the campaigns
      or other things they’ll learn, maybe data, I suppose, just that would influence their thinking about
      what’s going to happen? And then secondly, this one might be more useful or more answerable, you’ll
      get the exit polls, I don’t know, at 5:00 PM, 5:30 PM at CNN on Tuesday night, on election day. The
      rest of us will see them at 7:00 PM or so I think. The national polls at least. What will you look
      for? What would be sort of an indicator that, “This is working. This worked or this didn’t work,” or
      really Harris or Trump it looks like are doing better than we expected? Is there a particular
      question apart from the ballot test, obviously? But I mean a particular, I don’t know, anything you—
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I mean, I would say, “Is she winning among women more than he’s winning among men?” Would be the
      first thing I’ll be looking for. And the answer to that will depend heavily upon what’s happening
      with those non-college white women and those non-college non-white men. That’s probably going to
      tell us the answer to that question, but the first thing I will look for is he winning among men by
      more than she’s winning among women or vice versa.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Any issue that you would look for or are those questions overrated in these polls, that it’s more?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I think they’re overrated.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I do too.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I mean I think they’re overrated. I mean people say the economy… The other thing would be the
      retrospective job approval on Trump. I mean that would be the other thing that’s really going to be
      worth watching. If that’s at 50, whoo, that’s going to be tough for her. Your
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In the run-up to the election, I’d want to see a poll next weekend or after next weekend when the
      Times or Post goes back in the field for a last time what the retrospective job approval for Trump
      would be. Would you want to see that? Tell me what you would want to see in those polls.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, I mean that goes to your point about what I’d be watching in the last… I think Mike Podhorzer,
      the former political director of the AFL-CIO, who’s kind of like a behind-the-scenes guru/godfather
      of progressive political analysis and maybe some political action, but mostly the people who kind of
      think about messaging and polling and so forth, he points out… He has… And maybe only famously to me
      because written about it several times. He has calculated from data generated by Catalyst, which is
      a very good Democratic targeting company that targets voters, Mike has calculated
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And this is data … just to interrupt … So, I wrote about it this week too, and this is data that he
      gets from the voter file itself.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, from the voter files.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Not polling. How do you weigh it? How do you adjust it? This is actual human data.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Actual… Yeah. And maybe you know this, but Mike has calculated that in the last four elections, a
      combined 91 million separate individuals, 91 million separate human beings, have come out to vote in
      at least one of those four elections against Trump and Trumpism. Whereas 83 million people over
      those four elections have come out to vote for Trump or Trumpism. So that’s what leads him and Simon
      Rosenberg and some others who are battling over the copyright to talk about what they describe as
      the anti-MAGA majority in America. But the question, I think, in the last 10 days… Mike has said for
      a year that he thinks the election will be decided by what is the question in the last 10 days? What
      are we talking about? Are we talking about, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” In
      which case, Trump could be in position to narrowly squeeze out an electoral college victory or is
      the dominant dialogue that Trump is a threat to your rights, your values and democracy itself, which
      is what he believes is needed to activate the least engaged voters at the penumbraor the edgeof that
      anti-MAGA coalition. And Harris is clearly turning up the volume on that. As I said, I thought she
      really missed an opportunity by not doing that in any of her big media hits early in the month. And
      there’s a lot of headwinds in the terms of the economic dissatisfaction that people face. But I do
      think that her best chance is not so much to convert Trump voters as to envelop them, kind of
      overwhelm them by bringing in as much as you can of this broad coalition that really doesn’t want
      and has shown us that they don’t… At least in the states that matter, they have shown us they don’t
      want to live in the America that Trump has on offer. They don’t. They don’t want to live in a world
      where the National Guard is going from Indiana, as Stephen Miller has explained, is going to be
      going door to door in Chicago, rooting out people who are undocumented even if their kids are US
      citizens. I’m not sure a majority… People in polls say that they support that. That would last about
      an hour once it actually started happening. And everything else that goes with Trump. I will turn
      your question around and I will say the question will be, ” What is the question?”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s good. Well, we’ll see what the question is over the next 12 days.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      That’s why I do this for a living.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s good. That was good. That’s an appropriate thing to
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      That’s kind of like the blue wall, you know, I mean…
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That worked out great in 2016. Is that your term? That is your term.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yes. I coined “the blue wall” in 2009, but can I say a funny thing before we go?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      “The blue wall,” for people that people don’t know, that was Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      No. See, this is the problem. This is what’s happened. When I coined “the blue wall” in 2009 and I
      could actually hold up the cover story in National Journal called “The Blue Wall,” and in fact the
      lead of my story was, “Call it the blue wall.” And “the blue wall” referred to the 18 states that
      had voted democratic in every election from ’92 ultimately through 2012. It was the most states the
      party had won that often in its history. And if I remember correctly, it’s the most states that any
      party had won over six elections.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Six elections.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Trump in 2016 famously dislodged Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from the blue wall before
      Biden won them again in 2020. When people talk about the blue wall now, as you did, the vast
      majority of them are talking only about Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The irony for me as
      the father of “the blue wall” is that it’s the bricks that fell out of the wall that have become the
      wall now in the popular imagination and vernacular. Subtle difference, but if you notice in my
      stories, I always describe them as “the former blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and
      Wisconsin,” which hearkens back to the now-traduced trodden-over original definition of “the blue
      wall.” Although I have to say I’ve had other phrases that have lasted wine track, beer track for the
      primaries, coalition of the ascendant for the Obama era coalition. Coining something like “the blue
      wall” and having people still using it routinely, regularly, almost reflexively 15 years later is
      kind of gratifying even if like a raincoat, it has been turned inside out.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, well, that’s the question. Like Marx and Hegel and every other political philosopher in
      history complains about his
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Coinage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      People that start using his terms and saying they’re Marxists, but they don’t understand Marx at
      all. And I feel like
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Yeah, they’re the blue-wallians.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right, they’re not. Exactly, but still better maybe to have the
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And by the way… So Democrats have won the other 15 blue all states also in ’16 and ’20. I should go
      back and figure… And they’re going to win all of them again, the other 15 original blue wall states.
      So that will be 15 states over nine consecutive elections. I mean, just think about how remarkable
      that is. By the way, one other related point. If Harris wins the popular vote, which still seems
      more likely than not, Democrats will have won it an eight of the past nine. No coalition, no matter
      how dominant has ever done that. The best ever was seven popular vote victories over nine
      presidential elections by the McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover Republicans 1896
      to 1932, and then the Democrats, FDR, Truman through Kennedy and Johnson, ’32 to ’68. They each won
      seven out of nine. Democrats are about to win in all likelihood eight out of nine. And it is worth
      noting that in those two previous periods, the party that won seven out of nine never won the
      popular vote and lost the electoral college and Democrats are at risk of this happening for the
      third time in their current streak. And what’s more, and maybe this is the thought to close on,
      there’s a reasonable chance that if Trump wins, Republicans will win unified control of government
      while losing the presidential popular vote. They did that in 2016, they did that in 2000 and before
      that in American history, it had happened only once in 1888. So we are drifting into a real… I don’t
      know if we’re drifting, we’ve kind of surfed the rapids into a real crisis of majority rule in this
      country that again is a problem whatever happens in November, and I will stop now because we both
      have to go.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that was very interesting and maybe an appropriate close. We will talk right after the election
      in a little over two weeks and we will see what we’ve learned or what’s happened and you’ll analyze
      it.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Have a great
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But thank you so much for helping us think about it.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I appreciate it. But before I go, can I ask you the question you asked me. What will you be watching
      for most on election night?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, I don’t know. I think the Trump retrospective on the economy is important, but I guess I would
      want to know… I’m not sure what I’ll look for in the exit polls, but I am sort of all in partly
      because it’s just my preference and partly because I do think it’s true what you said, that you’ve
      got to get people more… And Podhorzer argued this very eloquently in that long memo that you and I
      both have quoted, I think, in the last few days. People need to be more alarmed about a Trump second
      term. And I think people like me honestly haven’t done as good a job as you might have in explaining
      why a Trump second term will be much more dangerous than a Trump first term. And that’s hard
      because, of course, voters’ instinct is to say, “You say it’s that dangerous. I don’t know. We had a
      first term of Trump, we saw already… He’s not some unknown guy you’re telling me.” So to be fair…
      And I’m not really criticizing the Harris campaign. I think it’s been on the whole a very good
      campaign actually.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      I agree.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But you bring home in his last 10 days with the assistance of Liz Cheney and others, the unique
      threat, the riskiness, the unhinged, unstable, unchecked, that whole rhetoric about Trump. I don’t
      care quite as much. I don’t have a view of exactly which angle of it is the best to do, “He’s going
      to take away your freedoms. He’s going to have a coup. He’s going to deport 15 million people,” tend
      to generally convey the riskiness of a second term. I tend to agree with you. If people do not go on
      election day of some number of swingish voters and less well-informed voters… Honestly don’t go in
      thinking, “Too much of a risk, too much… We just can’t take that risk with Trump again.” I think
      people need to be in that mindset probably for Harris to win, just given the fact that she’s the
      vice president of an unpopular administration. And in the era, in the last, what, five, six years
      since Covid, four years since Covid, incumbent governments have lost
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Around the world.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In most democracies, right?
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      By the way, the word that was doing… I think the most important word in your whole answer was Liz
      Cheney, and others. Others could matter. We haven’t heard from some of the major others, maybe we’re
      not going to. But you do wonder is there a Milly interview on 60 Minutes or the equivalent?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Or Bush. I mean, in a way, after resisting so long stepping, would Bush
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      Probably not. Probably none of this is going to happen. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I know. But if they finally said, “It’s unacceptable,” it might have a pretty big effect. All it
      takes is 1% of the voters to listen, or less.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein
    text: |
      And again, I do think those Republican-leaning college voters who are doing pretty well, inflation
      is an annoyance for them, but it’s not an existential challenge in the way it is for a lot of
      working-class people … I think they are open to that message if they hear it and the messengers
      matter, and whether anyone else of stature comes out and says that could be important between now
      and the finish line. Like I said before, Trump as you agree, I mean Trump is certainly helping with
      his behavior and I think he assumes that the more outrageous he is, the more likely it is that he
      turns out his infrequent voters. I mean, I don’t think this is just madness or just erratic
      behavior. I think he believes that the more windows he breaks, the more attention he captures among
      people who don’t pay a lot of attention to politics. But can you make him pay a cost for that among
      people who are much more likely to show up in the first place? We can do this all day. We’ve got to
      stop.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We could do this all day. We’ve got to stop. We’ll be back in two weeks. And Ron Brownstein, thank
      you so much for joining me again.
  - speaker: Ron Brownstein

      Great to be with you, now as in 1986.
