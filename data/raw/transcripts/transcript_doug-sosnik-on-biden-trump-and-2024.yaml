      Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again today by
      Doug Sosnik, the veteran democratic strategist, political director in the Clinton White House from,
      I think six years of the Clinton presidency, 1994 to 2000. Advised on dozens of Democratic campaigns
      over the years, often very successfully. Really widely regarded and respected in Washington as not
      just a political strategist who knows the ins and outs of campaign tactics, but a real thinker about
      American politics, the two parties, where we’ve been, where we’re going… People look forward to his
      monthly memos, which lay out some of his thinking on this. A very good piece in the New York Times
      earlier this week, we’re speaking on what? The 14th of February on Biden and Trump. Anyway, we had a
      conversation about what, six, seven months ago, and that stands up well, too. So Doug, thanks for
      joining me again.

      Okay, so Doug, well let’s just, maybe we’ll talk about where we are in the election, Biden and
      Trump, and then a little bit more broadly since you’re so good at that too, at the, not just where’s
      the election, but where’s the country and what things might happen that might surprise us, but
      where’s the race? I mean, you’ve been through so many of these. Give us the briefing.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik

      Well, I think if you think about where we are today compared to the last time we spoke in early
      June, I would say two things that are kind of cross currents. One is in one way the race hasn’t
      really changed in the senses that both Biden and Trump have obviously solidified their positions as
      the likely nominees. And I think there was probably a fair amount of skepticism back last June about
      whether these two guys would actually emerge out of this process and be the nominees. And it appears
      they are, and I think for different reasons, by the way. I think Trump is going to be nominee
      largely because of his support with the base of the party. And despite the fact there are a lot of
      Republicans who don’t really want to support him, they feel forced to because they fear the
      political retribution of Republicans at the base level. And in the case of Biden, his ability to go
      through a primary without a serious opponent is largely due not to the base, but to the political
      elites in the party who decided that it’s less of a risk to have Biden running again against Trump
      than it would be to have an open primary. And so for completely different reasons. I think they’re
      obviously in a much stronger position within their own parties now than they were back in June.
      What’s different, and it is different, is the race, I would say from the beginning of last year
      until around the middle to end of October, was pretty static. And it had Biden ahead of Trump, both
      nationally and in the battleground states. It was consistent. It wasn’t an overwhelming lead, but it
      was a lead of 2, 3, 4 points pretty much consistently. The polls never changed. Over the last three
      and a half, four months, the race has changed. And it started, I would say around the end of October
      with a series of polls that came out. There was a six-state battleground New York Times poll, which
      had Trump ahead in all six battleground states. And pretty significantly, the NBC poll that came out
      in early November had Trump ahead for the first time in their polling. And their Wall Street Journal
      poll came out in November, which not only showed the same Trump advantage, but they asked a series
      of questions which haven’t changed in the last three and a half months, which compared voters’ views
      of what life was like when Trump was president compared to what life is like with Biden as
      president. And the Trump presidency across almost every single issue was overwhelmingly remembered
      to be much more positive than the Biden presidency. And so if you fast-forward from the end of
      October till now, that has been the pattern. It’s been a consistent pattern. Now, I would say
      Trump’s support has not really increased in that time, but Biden’s support has gone down and they’re
      probably combination of factors. I do believe that the October 7th events and what happened
      following up in Israel and Gaza, I think has hurt Biden with his base. And I do think there’s a
      general sense that Biden is really not on top of his presidency. His job approval was now in the
      upper thirties, which is really, really, it’s the worst that we’ve had since Jimmy Carter was
      president. So, we’re now in a phase now going on several months where Trump is a clear, I would say
      advantage and maybe favorite. We haven’t really seen a lot of polling that’s come out in the last
      week since the special council’s report. So we’ll have to see if Biden’s numbers will go down even
      further. My hunch is because we’re in a divided country politically, Trump is still, despite his
      advantages, he’s still at the upper end of his ceiling of around 46 or 47%. He never once had a 50%
      job approval one time as president. So I think he’s pretty much at his high end, and I think Biden
      is probably at the low end of the range, but he really does need to pick up to get to at least the
      low to mid-forties if he’s going to win.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s terrific that somebody thinks to follow up on there, a very helpful overview. So let me just
      pick up on a couple of different things. I was struck by the one poll answer—question and answer—you
      mentioned from I guess late October on, whose presidency did you prefer it as retrospectively Trump
      or Biden currently? I do think that’s kind of undue, well, you couldn’t ask that question of course
      at any time in the last hundred years, right? Since we haven’t had an ex-president running against
      the current president and the most recent ex-president. So it is a weird race, a little different
      from the normal challenger-incumbent dynamics I think. I think we discussed this in June perhaps,
      where that people learn more about the challenger, it helps them if they like the challenger, it
      hurts them if they don’t like the challenger, it hurts the challenger if people don’t like him, if
      they see more of him. Here everyone has seen Trump for four years as president and Biden for three
      plus years as president. And I just feel like that’s a pretty fundamental number, isn’t it? If
      people think, “the Trump presidency was better for me than the Biden presidency”… I mean, I just was
      struck by that. I’d love your comments on that. I mean, because people are still talking about the
      races if it’s your standard incumbent versus— I’m sorry, challenger versus incumbent. It doesn’t
      quite feel that way though.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, you’re right about that. I think there are probably three reasons for that. The first is that
      people remember their economic situation in 2019 before Covid was in a much better position than it
      is now. And remember that we’ve gone through the biggest, highest rate of inflation in our country
      since the early 1980s. And majority of Americans were not either alive or were too young to remember
      what it was like in the early 1980s. So this is the first experience that a majority of Americans
      have ever had with inflation. And inflation’s like no other economic downturn in terms of the
      psychological impact that it has on people. And I think that even though the rate of inflation has
      gone down, the prices haven’t gone down and people are still feeling the aftershocks of an
      incredible period of prices going up. And until recently, wages did not keep pace with that.
      Particularly food prices that are up twenty-five percent more than they were in 2019. And all goods
      and services are up 19% more compared to 2019. I think the second problem is one of expectations
      that were set by Biden when he became president, that the adults were back in charge and that we
      were going to have calmness. I think if you asked me anything about single issue why Trump lost in
      2020, and I think the country felt exhausted from him and just didn’t really have the stomach and
      appetite for four more years of chaos. And so a big part of the Biden candidacy was the adults
      coming back and putting order. And I think that for a combination of factors, some of which have
      nothing to do with Biden, some of which do have to do with Biden, I think that people, despite the
      fact that you can look at consumer confidence has gone up in the last 90 days and a bunch of other
      metrics and unemployment is still low. And inflation, as I mentioned is down, is I think that people
      feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about their life and about their future, and that the adults did
      not come back and make things more calm. And then the third, which is obvious, we’re now clocking in
      and over three years of Biden being three years older now than he was three years ago. I do think
      that in the context of what I just mentioned, I think he does really appear older to people, not
      steady to people and not reassuring. And I think those combinations have given Trump an advantage,
      which as I mentioned earlier, we’ve now seen show up in the polling.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. The advantage being mostly that Biden’s drifted down, not that he’s gained that much Trump,
      right?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, but they also have finer memories of their economic situation.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s a very good point. I mean, Trump can say wacky things and frankly, deplorable and
      dangerous things about NATO and about God knows what. But…
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      And also I think that the issue of the border is both a real issue but also a proxy. It’s a real
      issue in the sense that there’s no metric you can look at about border crossings or anything else
      that’s been done since Biden became president and be able to fashion a positive story out of that.
      And also you see the impact now all across America and these blue states and blue cities like New
      York and Chicago and Denver, Colorado, where these migrants, illegal crossings now being flooded
      into these areas. And people feel the impact every day when they’re walking around and see these
      people sleeping on the streets and the safety. But it’s also a proxy for what I mentioned earlier
      about just the sense that things are not in control here now and that there’s not really a strong
      government in place to bring our lives back to normal.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I’m struck how much the retrospective, maybe slightly inaccurate, but whatever, view of things were
      much better when Trump or somewhat better when Trump was there. It helps him so much, right? I mean,
      if someone like me, here’s what he says about NATO, and I think, A, that’s incredibly irresponsible
      and dangerous and B, it actually suggests what a second Trump term would be like and it would be
      much more dangerous than a first Trump term. But I have the impression, voters they hear this stuff,
      it’s all kind of noise. Trump’s just being Trump. He says these things, but the thing they have to
      compare that’s fairly concrete is the Trump first term, or I suppose more accurately the memory of
      the Trump first term and the perception of the current Biden term. And I feel like that gives Trump
      a cushion that a normal challenger who said these kinds of things doesn’t have. I mean, he’s weirdly
      advantaged by being both the challenger, the outsider, the change candidate, and hey, he was
      president. I mean, there’s not that much to worry about. Things were okay when Trump was president.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, you’re right. I think that most people have sort of priced into the stock Trump saying crazy
      things, but above and beyond the economic narrative that Trump will be able to put out about when he
      was president compared to now on prices and inflation and the rest, he’s also going to be able to
      say regardless of whether or not he deserves any credit for or not, when he was president though,
      didn’t have a war in Europe, didn’t have a war in the Mideast, and aren’t getting closer to war
      every day in Asia. So, I think again, that reinforces this second point that I made earlier about
      the reason a lot of people supported Biden was to have normalcy back in people’s lives, more control
      with adults in charge.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You stress that Biden’s job approval hasn’t recovered. And I think some people I’ve talked to over
      the last two, three months have kept on saying, hoping maybe, “Well, it’s the economy. There’s a lag
      when there’s an economic recovery or when inflation goes down.” But gradually that eventually kicks
      in and it should affect the job approval. And I think some of the intelligent Democrats I’ve spoken
      with are a little, panicked’s too strong, but concerned, that so far, it’s not translating. I mean,
      voters seem able to say, “I have more confidence in the economy, more consumer confidence.” They
      even kind of know inflation is not as bad as it was. But that doesn’t, so far, hasn’t really
      translated to a job approval number.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      There’s a lag and that’s normal. But what I will say is I worked for President Clinton for six
      years, and as we all remember, those of us old enough can remember, we had our ups and our downs.
      But when someone asked me when was a real low point for us, or for me, and that was after the 1994
      midterm elections where the Democrats got destroyed and Clinton’s job approval was not that far away
      from where Biden’s is now. What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring
      of ’95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching
      him. And that really struck me, that struck fear with me. And I do worry a little bit that at some
      point the public is going to shut down on Biden in terms of giving him another look. And he’s got
      two related but different challenges right now. One is to inspire and motivate his base to not only
      support them, but to turn out. And it’s far from a given that that’s going to happen. And then the
      other of course is with the swing voters in the handful of states that’ll determine the next
      president if it’s a close election, his numbers with the swing voters are lagging his overall
      numbers, which are quite bad.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The kicker view in your New York Times piece was that disqualifying Trump might not be enough or
      likely wouldn’t be enough. You can’t just do that. I think Democrats have really been counting on
      that to a considerable degree. Explain that a bit.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don’t think have either
      thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary
      Clinton’s campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message. And you just simply
      can’t run for President of the United States without giving people a reason to vote for you. Now,
      look, at the end of the day, if Biden were to win, it’s going to be largely because of opposition to
      the Trump. But he does have an obligation, as I point out in the New York Times piece, to do what
      Ronald Reagan did in 1980. The country didn’t want to vote for Carter, but they had real
      reservations about Reagan. They had reservations about his age, they had reservations about his
      temperament. They had reservations about whether or not he was a little bit kind of a crazy right-
      winger. And despite the fact that Carter was in the high thirties or low forties for the entire
      campaign, it was a three-way race. It was only at the end, after the only debate, the end of
      October, did they coalesce around Reagan and support him. And it wasn’t because Reagan did so well
      in the debate, and he killed Carter. It was that Reagan did well enough. And so Biden has got to get
      to a point that he’s doing well enough to be able to make the race about Trump. And so at the end of
      all this, I’d say it’s probably a 30/70 ratio. 30% of Biden’s message has got to be a positive
      reason for people to support him. And 70% can be about Trump. But you can’t make it a hundred
      percent about Trump.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Talk through, even through these actual presidential campaigns. Let’s maybe just bracket the very
      small chance, I suppose that Biden steps aside, some of us might have urged him to consider that, or
      the small Trump, the chance that Trump something gets tripped up or by Nikki Haley or by the courts
      decisively. And so, what are the moments, what do you look for now over the next, how many months
      are we away? I kind of lost track. Eight months, something like that.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Yeah, we’re almost nine months away. And the longest general election in modern political history,
      we’ll have over 60% of the country doesn’t want to see either one of these people run.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. What is the implication of, how does that affect everything? I feel like we don’t even know
      quite how that, we’ve never really been through something quite like this, have we?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      No, no. Well, a little bit in 2016 with Hillary, and I’ll come to that in terms of what to watch for
      in a moment.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Okay. Good.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      But both right now, Biden’s favorable, unfavorable, very unfavorable about the same as Trump’s. So,
      you really have two candidates that mirror each other. So the race, I believe, if it’s close, will
      be back to what it has been. There’s six swing states that are going to determine the next President
      of the United States. Five of them were the ones that voted for the winning candidate in 2016 and
      2020, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona. And then the sixth state that I would
      add is Nevada, which actually right now Trump is leading by more than the other states. And these
      are two states that narrowly voted for Clinton and for Biden. So we’re back to the same handful of
      states which represent less than 15% of the US population. So the race starts out, nine months out
      with, remember, they reallocated the electoral college now based on reapportion and redistricting,
      which is a net six positive for Trump and Republicans due to population changes. So Trump starts out
      with 235 electoral votes. Biden has 226 electoral votes. So if 77 electoral votes at stake that are
      going to determine who the next President of the United States is. And so back to your question,
      traditionally there are the same swing voters generally in our country in the last 50 years. The
      swing voters that Reagan carried in 1980 are the same core group of swing voters that Biden needs to
      carry in 2024, which are, a couple of them are the independent voters, which we all know about, are
      moderate voters and suburban voters. But there are a couple of additional groups of voters that I
      think are going to be important to watch in this election because they’re both so unpopular. One is
      third party candidates. We saw that they made the difference in 2016, which is the last time you had
      two very unpopular nominees. And I think about 18% of the people who voted in 2016 disliked both
      candidates and Trump carried them by 17 points. So one is third parties and what kind of impact they
      can have. If you go back to Michigan, I think there were 175,000 third party votes in ’16 in a state
      that Trump carried by a little bit more than 10,000 votes. And the vast majority of those people who
      voted third, fourth, fifth party would’ve voted for Hillary in a two person race. And you saw in
      22,000 in Florida, where, I think, 95,000 people voted for Ralph Nader in an election that Bush won
      by less than 400 votes. So because the uniqueness of both of these candidates being unpopular, one
      is the third party impact and then the second are what I call double haters, the people that dislike
      both candidates, and as I mentioned a minute ago, they were decisive in 2016. So I think that’s
      going to be a key group of swing voters in 2024. I guess I might add a third one, which are, I don’t
      know if this has been branded, but I would call Bill Kristol Republicans. There are about 20, 25% of
      Republicans who really dislike Trump, and don’t want to vote for Trump. But if you go back to
      Biden’s weaknesses right now, they’re some of the people that are really balking at voting for Biden
      because of how little confidence they have in him, the fear that he is not going to get through a
      second term and that Kamala Harris is going to be president. And this is amongst the group that need
      reassurance that Biden is up to four more years.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah I’d say those are “Bill Kristol-adjacent Republicans.” Those of us who are real ex-Republicans,
      I’m voting against Trump, period. But I agree, I still know, of course, many such people and we all
      do and would agree that they exist and there’s a pretty decent size—enough to make a difference—size
      of these kind of… Certainly of Biden voters in 2020 who probably voted Republican down ticket or
      voted Republican some in 2022 and very open to convincing themselves that even though they would’ve
      preferred it wouldn’t be Trump, maybe Trump isn’t quite as dangerous as people like me think and
      Biden’s totally out of his… He has lost control and he’s too old. That’s where I think the age thing
      incidentally, I just want comment on really, it gives a kind of neutral excuse for those swingish
      Republicanish Biden 2020 voters to say, “I voted for him once and I think it hasn’t been great, but
      it’s not terrible. But that was for four years, that was supposed to be a transitional thing, and
      now they want me to vote for him again and look how he’s doing at some of these at the press
      conference the other night and so forth.” I feel like it’s an easy way for those people to slide
      back towards the Trump voter, certainly to not voting for Biden.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, I would say two things. One is we go back to “Bill Kristol-adjacent Republicans” for a minute.
      If you look at the 2022 midterm elections and the failure, despite all the advantages in the world
      of the Republicans to take back the US Senate, the day after the midterms in which for the second
      cycle in a row, Republicans did not take back the Senate when they should have. One of the reasons
      that Mitch McConnell said in his day after press conference was they didn’t take control of the
      Senate in these swing states because of Republican voters defecting away from the right-wing
      Republican nominees. The other thing I’ll mention about maybe explaining why either people are
      dismissing Trump or having selective memory about what it was like, I think there are a couple,
      there’s one thing for sure, which I think really is an indictment of American government and leaders
      in politics. We’re getting the kind of disconnect you used to see in Italy where you’d have 40
      governments and 40 years and no one really cared because what was going on in politics and
      government had nothing to do with people’s lives. And you had 40 governments in 40 years and they
      were like, “Okay, we had 40 governments in 40 years. But life went on and nothing really changed.”
      And I think we’re unfortunately getting a little bit like that in America. And there’s much less
      enthusiasm and energy, by the way, for this 2024 election than there was in the 2022 election. And I
      think you’re going to see turnout down, turnout’s been high for the last four or five election
      cycles, and I think you’re going to see turnout go down. You’re seeing viewership on every metric
      about politics going way down, whether it’s watching cable television, subscribing to newspapers,
      tuning into debates. And the other thing though, which is I think really dangerous, is elections
      used to be about issues and choices and you elect someone and then they implement whatever they ran
      on. The issues that are going to decide this election and the implications of whether it’s a Trump
      presidency or Biden presidency in terms of tax policy and of a whole host of issues, they’re not
      talking about the issues that are meaningful in terms of people’s lives and what’s going to happen
      when someone wins the election. And so there’s really not so much of a ballot test on the
      substantive direction of our country as it is the context of an evenly divided country, largely
      based on tribal politics in which education is the best predictor. And the question of the
      personalities of two people that you don’t like either one of them and they’re running. But if you
      watch this election in terms of what the policy positions are, it’s got very little do with what’s
      going to happen from a governing standpoint in 2025.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      And the degree to which Trump… so in Georgia in 2022, to just follow up in your example, Herschel
      Walker was just too unacceptable a candidate. And so he lost, so some Republicans deserted him.
      Right now, Trump’s clearly ahead in Georgia, I think. And so now for me, it’s a little crazy to say,
      believe me, I would not have voted Herschel Walker either. But it’s a little crazy to say that
      Herschel Walker is more dangerous to the country as one senator out of 100 than Donald Trump as
      President of the United States, who’s going to pull out of NATO and all these other things. And
      staged a coup, and we won’t even go into it, but that’s not quite where these swing voters are right
      now. I think some of our democratic friends, maybe our friends in the Biden White House in campaign
      sort of assume that, well, obviously if you’re against Herschel Walker, you got to be against Donald
      Trump. But I think they underestimate just, yeah, the degree to which it can’t just be a referendum
      on Trump, as you said, and then the age issue with Biden. It’s a little puzzle. I mean, at first
      blush, it does seem sensible to say, “Well, come on, why won’t it be 2022 again?” But those are
      Trumpy candidates who lost in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, except Trumpy candidates
      aren’t quite the same thing as Trump, right?

      Well, and we’ve talked a lot about this and we talked about it last June. I mean, the fault line in
      American politics now is really education levels. And the reason that those six states that we
      mentioned earlier are the only competitive states right now is with the exception of Nevada, which
      has voted democratic even though it’s towards the bottom of education levels. The other five states
      are all kind of in the middle of education levels. So that in most states you have 40 states right
      now in which one party controls the governorship and the legislature, and it’s all based on whether
      or not they’re highly educated or low levels of education. And so what makes these states unique is
      the fact that they don’t skew too much one way or the other on education levels. So you’ve got this
      issue of abortion, which is a huge issue if it’s, quote, unquote, “on the ballot,” but is less of an
      issue if people in the community don’t feel threatened by it. And so right now, again, just focusing
      on these six states, Arizona is going to have abortion on the ballot in November, and Nevada is
      quite possibly going to have it. There’s some other states, but they’re not part of the six. But if
      you take the three Midwestern states in the three sort of Sunbelt states, the Sunbelt states I think
      are more favorable in general to Trump and the Republicans for three reasons. One is from an
      economic standpoint; I think they feel more pinched by what’s been going on and remember more fondly
      2019 with an economy under Trump. The second is, if you look at the polling particularly of swing
      voters, is the sense that Democrats are just spending way too much money in government, and that’s a
      big part of the problem. And then the third are the, I guess I would call them crime related issues
      of the border and crime as proxies for a sense of not trusting Democrats. And so as a result of
      that, I do think the only way that Biden carried Georgia in 2020 and the Democrats held onto the
      Senate in 2020 was because of Trump, because of Trump on the ballot in 2020 and because of Trump’s
      role in the special elections for the two Senate seats. But that state is still, I think, more leans
      Republican for those reasons that I cited. And I do think the same is for Arizona, particularly in
      the case of Arizona and Nevada. You’ve got a large number of non-whites who are lower educated
      voters who are moving increasingly towards Trump and the Republicans making it more problematic for
      Democrats.

      Yeah, I mean it’s a close… Looks like it’s going to be a close front thing. Either way. Let’s get
      back, I want to get back to third parties in a minute. I’ve just got to think when there’s two
      thirds of the voters don’t want either of these people, there’s a little more of a possibility of
      that than conventional wisdom in DC has it. But let me hold up on that for a minute. Just give
      people, I think a sense—not just—but of the events. I mean, normally, maybe this isn’t their normal
      campaign and these things don’t matter, especially. We would say, “Well, what would happen? What’s
      going to happen that it’s going to matter?” Trump will pick a VP, there’ll be conventions, there’ll
      be debate. They’re usually these moments where there’s a huge amount of campaigning that makes no
      difference at all or makes a minute difference in whatever locality they’re going to or whatever
      issue pops up. And sometimes it can be an important difference if it pops up and it becomes a kind
      of big story like the special counsel or whatever. But the predictable things, I mean, are we just
      in a new world where all that kind of stuff matters so much less or does any of those things VP,
      conventions, debates, what would you pick of those?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Yeah, so it’s a funny thing. I mean, the volatility of what’s going on in our lives is at so much
      faster a pace than anything that we’re ever accustomed to. It’s almost mind-boggling to me if you
      think about where the world is now in February compared to where it was in June when we last got
      together. So on the one hand, the pace of what’s happening is just at so much, and events that
      appear to be significant are so much greater than anything we’ve ever seen in our lifetime. On the
      other hand, the more this stuff happens, the less things matter because the fundamentally, it’s the
      tectonic plates of the divisions in our country based on tribal politics right now that overrides
      almost everything else. And so as a result of that, it’s really hard to break the tectonic plates of
      everyone being dug in. So back to your question, I would say the things I would watch are, one is
      the economy, and first of all whether it improves. And I think people have a different view on that
      today than you might’ve had on Monday based on the last round of inflation numbers that came out. So
      the first though is the economy: does it improve, continue to improve, people continue be able to
      register in polling that they feel more confident about the economy? And then lastly of course on
      that is whether Biden gets any credit for that. So that’s one issue. Second is the external events,
      and I do believe using the October 7th invasion and the follow-up that it has had a significant
      political impact politically for Biden for the negative. Third would be on Trump. I think it’s a
      combination of what happens in the legal process, if anything. And the polling does show he is
      convicted of a crime before the election, it does have an impact in the outcome. And secondly, it’s
      just Trump himself personally. Actually, he’s not out very much, by the way. The very little secret
      is he’s got his own 2020 basement strategy. Again, the tectonic plates were so strong that the
      traditional, you go in 99 counties and campaign in Iowa, DeSantis did that, and didn’t carry a
      single county. Trump barely went to Iowa and Trump barely campaigned in New Hampshire. But when he
      is out there is an erratic nature to his performance. And so I think we’ll have to see that. And
      then lastly, in the case of Biden, I think a lot of it’s going to have to do with how he manages or
      isn’t able to manage the issue. And he’s going to have the pressures of at 81 years old, of not only
      running a country but running a campaign. And so you’ll see a lot of that played out through proxy
      things like debates. When you have debates and Trump wants debates, he wants to engage Biden as much
      as possible in spontaneous events. And you can see the Biden White House is very concerned to put
      him out in non-controlled environments. They didn’t do the Super Bowl interview. So I think a lot of
      it for Biden, I can tell you stories you want about the Reagan White House, but I think for Biden, a
      lot of it is going to be just turn the sound off and watch him on TV and see how he looks. And if
      you got a problem with how he looks, that’s going to be a big problem in terms of trying to manage
      his age problem.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The Super Bowl interview thing kind of freaked me out a little, and I wrote this little piece on
      Monday which suggested he might still step aside, it’s a little late, quite late, but that the
      primary process would still be better produced, likely a stronger candidate. I obviously could be
      wrong, and this may most likely will never be tested, I suppose, but the Super Bowl interview you
      mentioned earlier, people— you know, fragmented viewing, people less engaged in politics and
      fragmented political obviously universe. The one thing, Super Bowl did have the highest ratings
      ever, and that was predictable that it was going to have very high ratings. And people are happy
      when they’re watching the Super Bowl generally, I think, and maybe they’re worried about their own
      team if they’re in San Francisco or Kansas City, but otherwise it’s a spectacle, you get together.
      And that’s always been such a gimme for the incumbent president to have a pleasant interview with
      two sports announcers, in this case on CBS, who presumably are going to ask totally nice questions
      to Biden and let him talk a little bit about how much he likes sports and reminiscing about playing
      football with his kids, whatever he wants, who he’s rooting for, did he grow up rooting for the
      Eagles? I mean, whatever. And the fact that they didn’t do that, I feel is now maybe he just didn’t
      want to do it and he’s busy. I mean, there are a million things, right? But maybe I’m wrong that
      it’s always such an easy interview, but I feel like, geez, can you really go through— have a
      strategy for nine months where you’re not… They couldn’t stop him from going, the staff couldn’t
      persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel
      report. And that was not great. And then he chose not to do the Super Bowl interview. And again, I
      don’t want to make a mountain out of a molehill, obviously in the big picture, no one’s going to
      remember Super Bowl interview in 2024, but I don’t know if that’s sustainable for eight, nine
      months. Trump isn’t exactly Mr. Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get… He’s good at
      giving the impression that he’s doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at
      least, and therefore people kind of feel like he’s on top of things.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press
      compared to Biden. So let me just say this quickly on the interview. These interviews have become
      staples of Super Bowl Sunday. They have changed over time and have become less soft interviews and
      harder interviews and more aggressive interviews. So that’s changed. They had over 10 million people
      watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that’s a
      lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people
      didn’t want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were
      probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the
      interview. And so I do think the Biden guys might say on his Thursday night appearance last week
      that if he took out a couple of bad snippets confusing the president of Mexico and Egypt, he took
      out a couple of those bites and it was largely a positive interview, but they only cherry-pick the
      worst parts. And I think there is probably was a concern that for the vast majority of people who
      aren’t going to watch the interview but are going to see the coverage of it, that they’re going to
      pick out a couple of these kinds of stumbles that Biden has sort of made a trademark of interviews,
      and that would define it. The last thing I’ll say, though, is Biden should be running like he’s
      behind, and the reason that he should run that way is because he is behind. And that doesn’t mean
      you have to do the 60 Minute[s] interview, but you better figure out, if you’re not going to do it,
      what you are going to do to break through to people.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. That’s well said. I mean, the polarization, I guess, just trumps so much. That’s one message
      you’ve—implicit or sometimes explicit—point you’ve been making. I mean, that is the tectonic shape
      of American politics today, more polarization, than, God, than we’ve seen, certainly. I mean, the
      idea that you’d move up 15 points after a good convention, like Bush in ’88, or things would hinge
      on a debate in the last week, and, what, Carter-Reagan probably moved 10 points or something
      conceivably in that last week, it just seems inconceivable today. Things move two points and
      everyone’s going crazy, right?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, you have a world now—you’re right—of what I call, “high floors, low ceilings,” which is
      because these tectonic plates are so baked in, it’s hard to go below a certain number of support,
      and it’s hard to get above a certain number. Now, that’s where the problem right now is, is that
      Trump, as I said earlier, is kind of bumping up to the high end of his ceiling, and Biden is at
      least bumping up to the bottom of his floor. And if you have, all of a sudden, with a relatively
      evenly divided country, one of the guys is at that high part of their floor and the other’s at the
      low part, or towards their ceiling, that gap becomes real and meaningful, and that’s what you’re
      seeing in the polling. But I think that in many ways we have two Americas, and we use education as
      the sort of proxy for defining these tribal differences in our country, but it’s really cultural as
      much as it is economic, and there are economic impacts that affect the culture, and that’s why it’s
      so much more deep-seated. I’ll just tell you a quick story. So when Trump was president, I used to
      go to speak to Democratic groups, and in the questions and answers they’d say, “I don’t understand
      why these non-college voters are voting for Trump. The economic policies of Trump favor the rich.
      Why are these idiots supporting him?” Then I’d go to a Republican group and they would say, “I don’t
      understand these young college graduates—then name a color. The economic opportunities have never
      been greater for them since Trump became president. Why aren’t they supporting Trump?” And the
      answer for both groups is the same, which is that this is much more deep-seated about who you are as
      a person, what your values are. That does correlate to education but it’s much deeper than that. And
      so as a result of that, if you believe that, it shows you why it’s so difficult to get out of this
      relatively evenly divided country.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So in our previous conversation you thought this will eventually break open. It’s kind of not really
      sustainable, ultimately, and I very much agree with that. That’s a 2028 or 2032 thing or something
      like that. I gotta say, part of me thinks… not most of me, most of me thinks we’re going to have a
      polarized election that’ll be very much as you described, either it’ll look like 2016 or 2020 and
      that’ll be the kind of range of outcomes in those six states. But a little bit of me thinks, I don’t
      know, if two thirds of the country doesn’t want these guys, and they’re going to both clinch, let’s
      assume, their party’s nomination. I mean, Biden already has, but… On March 5th, on Super Tuesday.
      The headlines on March 6th will be, okay, it’s over. Primaries are over. Let’s assume Trump wins
      almost every state against Haley. And voters look up. Sarah Longwell finds in her focus groups
      voters don’t quite understand. They haven’t quite internalized that this is the choice. There’s
      still a little bit of, “I don’t know, this is February. Something will happen. The Democrats could
      switch candidates. Maybe Trump, something could even happen with him.” …A little less of that, I’d
      say. I just feel like voters look up on March 6th and think, “Oh my God.” And then it’s April 6th,
      and then it’s May 6th, and then it’s June 6th. We’re not even at the conventions yet, right? Biden’s
      not getting any younger. Trump’s not getting less extreme in some ways, I don’t think. I don’t know.
      Is a third party thing possible, independent candidacy possible even this year? Could the tectonic
      plates be totally powerful and strong until something really happens? I don’t know. I just feel a
      little bit like that’s more possible than I would’ve thought a few months ago.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, I think it’s more possible. Look, going back to your first point, young voters think quite
      differently about issues and institutions and politics than baby boomers and the Greatest
      Generation, and the largest population groups in America now are millennials and Gen Z, and they’ll
      be the largest voting group by the end of the decade. And if you look at the polling and the
      research that’s been done, Harvard’s done a lot of this, where the young Republicans think quite
      differently than older Republicans on issues they care about, and the same with young Democrats. So
      I do think we’ll get out of this cul-de-sac when the younger generations take over, and they’re not
      going to be fighting the same fights we’ve had for the last 50 years. And over the long term, I
      think third party candidates can be much more viable, because when you think about all institutions
      that the young people have dismissed and no longer believe in, and now we put the political parties
      right at the top of that list. But getting back in real time to now, back to your question, I think
      one thing that’s different for a lot of people is, I think people learned a lesson, Democrats
      learned a lesson in 2016 that when you don’t vote, or you vote for a third party or fourth party or
      fifth party, it’s not free, and there are real political implications or policy implications by a
      protest vote and all that. That’s not to say that in February, March, April, and May or June that
      people aren’t going to maybe support third and fourth parties, fifth parties, but I do think for
      some people the 2016 experience will ultimately impact when they have to get to a decision point, as
      most of the time you look at the history of third party candidacies, the numbers go down as you get
      closer to the election, but eight, nine months out, two candidates you don’t like, I mean, why not
      as a proxy say you’re for a third and fourth party? And I think particularly for Democrats, the
      third party option is also a reflection that they could have the satisfaction enough, while they
      don’t go out and vote third or fourth or fifth party, they just may not vote. And the other thing
      I’ll just mention, I alluded to it earlier, back with Reagan and took control of the race in the
      last 10 days in 1980 after the first debate, I think it was October 28th, if you have a debate this
      October 28th, over half the country would have already voted. So in terms of when is when, it starts
      right after Labor Day. People are going to be voting around America, across a number of states, all
      throughout September and well in October, and by election day in 2020 I think 68% of the people, I
      think, had already voted. So as you’re thinking about, quote-unquote, nine months into the election,
      you really need to back it up, because you’re really going to feel the deadline encroaching, because
      if you live in Michigan and some of these early voting states, they’re actually going to be voting
      in September. And then if you look a few weeks before that is the Democratic Convention in Chicago,
      and so I think in August is going to be the real truth test for people about what they’re going to
      do.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. Yeah, you’re right. I hadn’t really focused on the… I’ve thought a lot about the
      current calendar and the primary. I want to ask you about it briefly as we wrap up. The primary.
      What would happen if Biden steps aside? I’ve thought of a fair amount about the primary calendar. I
      thought a fair amount about the ballot access challenges for independent candidates and third
      parties, which are not actually as prohibitive as people think, and I’m not a big fan of the third
      party option. God knows after 2016, I just think people here in DC underestimated a little how much
      sentiment there would be out there, but maybe it would dissipate. It would be a lot of excitement in
      April, and then by June [inaudible].
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, I think a lot of it would depend on who it is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Yeah.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      And the third party candidacies historically that had an impact were kind of like movement
      candidacies. Wallace in ’68, which is the last time a third party candidate carried states, I mean,
      regardless of what you thought of his politics, he had clear politics. And if you look at the
      McCarthy in the ’68 primary, you look at Perot in ’92, I mean, he actually stood for something. So
      it’s easier said than done when you get real about who is a third party candidate going to be, and
      who’s the vice president, but I don’t think it’s going to be enough to just say, “I’m not the other
      guys.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. But the pushing back of the calendar on the back end does make that
      Democratic Convention weirdly important, perhaps. I mean, those of us who’ve been intrigued by the
      notion of Biden stepping aside have also been intrigued by the notion of the excitement of the open
      write-ins in the primaries, and a lot of uncommitted delegates, and an open convention, and everyone
      I know is like-
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, the problem is… I think it’s true for Republicans, I know it’s true for Democrats, which the
      last time that the convention served that purpose of nominating someone based on who’s on the
      convention floor was ’68.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s an unfortunate memory for Democrats.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Yeah, and so that was such a disastrous-
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But let me make this, can I just— So I read this little piece, and I said, it’s funny that the
      convention was in Chicago, because you know what? The convention was in Chicago, Roosevelt in 1932,
      and I believe Roosevelt was nominated on the third ballot, and it was a very much of a weeding out
      of candidates, some of whom… They weren’t really primaries then, but who were favorite sons and so
      forth. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago at 1860 on the fourth ballot, so maybe multi-ballot
      conventions in Chicago were good. Then [inaudible] 19,000 people wrote in and said, “Are you
      kidding? What about ’68?” But I would make this point about ’68, just not to obsess too much on the
      replacing Biden thing. It was a horrible mass. Robert Kennedy was tragically assassinated, McCarthy,
      Humphrey, the violence in Chicago, Dick Daley, the whole nightmare, right? Still, at the end of the
      day, Humphrey almost won in ’68, and I believe Humphrey would’ve ran better in ’68 than Lyndon
      Johnson would have…
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Sure.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … as the incumbent.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Sure.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Now, Biden’s not Johnson. We don’t have the Vietnam war going on. I understand all that, but I think
      it’s so much easier, of course, to see the risk of the unknown, and then to say, “Look, let’s just
      stick with the known, and we’re going to make it through,” and Democrats may well do it and I
      frankly would hope they would do it if that’s the path they stick on. But I don’t know. I’m struck.
      Maybe just more broadly to let you talk about it. I mean, the convention with Biden and Harris, it’s
      kind of a boring… I mean, how do they make that exciting in August? At least Trump gets to pick a VP
      in July, right?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, I’ll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let’s assume
      nothing changes and then I’ll talk about if something does change.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      All right.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden’s going to have to clear at the convention is one
      of reassurance and that he’s up to it. He’s not going to be exciting. He doesn’t need to be
      exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something
      happened for a moment, the big point about ’68, though, and what happened after was, they changed
      the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They
      actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he’d
      broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would’ve won. But let’s just
      take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If
      something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So
      those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact
      that despite the fact there’s still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates
      haven’t been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC. So if something were to happen at a
      Republican convention, I don’t know what they would do except I do know that the MAGA forces are
      going to decide what happens. I think it’s quite different on the Democratic side. As a party
      coalescing behind Biden, the organizing principle about being for Biden is to stop Trump, and as I
      think I’ve mentioned before to you, he’s the first person elected president since 1988, when George
      H. W. Bush got elected for essentially a Reagan third term, which I’m sure you remember quite well…
      Biden is the first guy since Bush to get elected without a political base. And so his base of
      support, if there is one, is an anti-Trump support. So if you take these people that have coalesced
      as a party, and the party’s more of a federation of interests really than it is a party that’s got a
      narrow focus like Republicans now, it’s unclear what those delegates would do at the convention if
      it got to that, because of the motivation of how they got there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      So interesting. And maybe we’ll close on this, but you think a lot about the parties as institutions
      as well as who’s the candidate this year. The parties seem so different now. A, each different from
      what they were, but, B, I mean, you have a Democratic Party which really is a coalition of interest
      groups and views and governors, and so if Biden just steps aside, there’d be people who prefer
      Newsom, people who prefer Whitmer, Shapiro, Vice President Harris. There are teachers unions
      delegates, and there’d be various kinds of ideological groups, and moderates versus AOC fans, and
      people like me would say, “Hey, look how Suozzi won in Long Island by being a moderate,” and other
      people would say, “No, you need the energy of a Bernie Sanders.” Whatever. I feel like that’s more
      like a traditional American political party, though, in some ways. The Republican Party really is… I
      mean, when people say cult of personality, they’re sort of missing, I think, the key. It is a
      movement, though, of a kind that you don’t see that often in America. I mean, the degree to which it
      is based around one person, Trump, but then by now it’s got a pretty big associated bunch of not
      just issues but attitudes, and stances towards institutions and towards the past, and repudiation of
      the recent past of that party in a really dramatic way, right? I mean, the Trump people hate the
      Bush and McCain and [inaudible] people more than they hate Democrats, to some degree. I don’t know.
      It’s to say a little bit about these two parties, right?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Yeah, I think you’re absolutely right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I don’t quite know how that all works out, but…
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      You’re absolutely right, and they are completely in different places. And if you take Yogi Berra’s
      old saying, “If there’s a fork in the road, take it.” The Republicans have taken their fork in the
      road, and they’re now more of a working class party, more of a nationalist party, more of a MAGA
      party. They are. And so in a sense they’re, it’s kind of a narrow base of support, but quite deep. I
      think on the Democratic side, back to the Yogi Berra quote, they haven’t taken the fork in the road,
      and, in fact, this is something I’ve written on and I haven’t published it yet, there’s going to be
      an enormous reckoning for the Democratic Party that’s going to happen the day after the election,
      regardless of whether Trump is elected or not. And you’ve got a combination of forces that are
      really going to explode the day after the election. What is the nature, as you said earlier about
      the nature of the Democratic Party, which is really, I call it almost a federation of interest,
      whether you’re motivated by gun control, or pro-choice, or Black lives matter, or unions, or the
      environment. But what you’ve got is a party that’s got really stunted growth. And the reason it’s
      been stunted is, the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, and the Obama-Biden administration have now
      controlled and dominated American politics for over 30 years. So there’s an entire generation of
      Democratic elected officials had never had an opportunity to rise. Secondly, Obama, who got elected,
      is essentially challenging the Democratic establishment. When he got elected president, he didn’t
      care about the Democratic party. He didn’t care about democratic candidates. He never took all his
      data file of millions of supporters and went to the DNC. The Democrats made historic losses in 2010
      due to the negligence, and over the course of eight years of Obama, Democrats lost almost 1,000
      state legislative candidates, got eviscerated in the house and the Senate, controls of these
      legislatures, and so really the 2010s was a lost generation, a lost decade for Democratic elected
      officials across the country, and as I said earlier, fed this lost generation. Now, since, I would
      say, lastly, since 2016, so we’re clocking in now eight years, the organizing principle of the
      Democratic Party has not been what you’re for, but what you’re against, and it’s been a party that’s
      been organized singularly to deal and beat with Donald Trump. And so, you’ve got this sort of
      mishmash of forces that have been building, that are going to explode the day after the election,
      about what does it mean to be a Democrat?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean my slight—maybe caveat, I don’t know what you think of this—of that count, which is very,
      very interesting. I mean particularly I want to say how important it is what you say about the sort
      of Clintons and then Obama/Biden dominating for so long, that they did probably suppress a whole
      generation of people who we know even who’ve left office by now, they rose and fell. On the other
      hand, of course as you say anti-Trump was key for the last six to eight years. On the other hand,
      the Democrats have produced… I mean, just came down from Mars and looked at, okay, they got Shapiro
      in Pennsylvania, they got Whitmer in Michigan, they got Polis in Colorado, and Newsom in California.
      They’ve got very impressive younger members of the house. Some of them not quite in the Senate yet,
      but they will get there. Abigail Spanberger will probably be governor of Virginia in 2025. They have
      actually what looks more like a normal bench, somewhat diverse actually and somewhat… Then there are
      people on the left, I probably mentioned a little more of the moderates. I don’t know. But that
      Biden running for reelection again, I won’t obsess on this, is sort of putting a cork over that. I
      do feel like, yeah, there’s a real kind of… And the question would be, is removing that cork
      healthier now or not? And obviously it’s unlikely to happen, so we’re going to have to wait. But I
      don’t know. That’s an interesting question of how much… Is there a healthy democratic party beneath
      the surface? But there still will be fights as you say, on a whole bunch of issues. I mean for me as
      a foreign policy hawk, it’s encouraging to see how many Hubert Humphrey or even Scoop Jackson
      Democrats there are floating around in Congress apparently. They’re all voting for aid to Ukraine,
      and the Republicans are opposing it. On the other hand, a lot of my friends think, “oh, the Left’s
      got all the momentum and the energy among young people. So I think you’re right, the Democrats have
      to resolve their future, but also the Trump side is kind of unstable, right? I mean, ultimately
      Trumpism is not, it’s not clear that it’s a stable movement. It’s more of a movement and less of a
      coalition. So I guess both parties could be… I mean, 2025 could be a very interesting year no matter
      who wins on both sides.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well look, I think it’s going to be a new era no matter what. I think that Trumpism without Trump is
      not the same as Trumpism with Trump. But I think the basic contours of the Republican Party will be
      the same with or without Trump, which is working class nationalist, we consider it more xenophobic.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, you think they don’t go back?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      I don’t think they go back.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I’m not that way. But some of my Republican friends who still want to hang on to hope, that’s not
      coming back.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      So let me address what you just said in two things. First of all, there’s been in this eight year
      period, kind of an unspoken bargain. Which is, the left gets to drive the policy direction of the
      Democratic Party, but the Democrats get to nominate moderate candidates. And if you look at the
      impact of Bernie Sanders on the 2016 election, and the change of policy positions that Hillary took
      to get nominated, you look at Biden’s 2020 primary, you look at positions he took as President of
      the United States. The United States senator that served for 35 years is a completely different guy
      on issues than what he did as president. And if you compare the Biden presidency on policy, compared
      to the Obama presidency on policy, it’s way far to the left. And the reason why was—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Not on foreign policy though, I’d say the opposite on foreign policy.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, it depends on what your definition of foreign policy is. I think on trade—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, trade, no, you’re right, not on trade, fair enough, fair enough.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      …in the international agenda economically. So, they’ve had this bargain. And you look at the impact
      that Elizabeth Warren had on all the appointments in the Biden administration on all the regulators.
      So they’ve had this sort of bargain which hasn’t been… Is going to need to be litigated going
      forward, which is about progressivism versus the moderation. But the last thing I’ll say is, I do
      agree with what you said about Whitmer and Newsom and all these people. But just to understand how
      it got there. It was 15 years of being at a political wilderness for Democrats following the 2010
      midterm elections, to get to a point that you could to restock a bench. Now, part of the bench got
      restocked in part because of what the crazy Republican right wingers did in power. So, you take a
      place like Michigan that is now controlled by Democrats in the governorship and the state
      legislature, for the first time since the mid 1980s. That’s the first time Democrats have had
      control of the state legislature. Look what’s going on in Wisconsin. So you’re right about what’s
      happening now for the Democrats. But they’re coming out of a 15 year valley. And then the question
      of course becomes, well, let’s see what they got right? It’s going to start happening the day after
      the election, whether Biden wins or loses. And that’s where you find out who people are made of. But
      part of the problem Democrats have had is, this whole generation of elected officials have never had
      the opportunity to step forward and see what they got. I mean, Bill Clinton ran in ’91 for president
      because no one was going to run, because everyone knew Bush was going to get reelected. So Clinton
      ran. Well, Clinton was able to demonstrate, because of that opportunity, that he had the right
      stuff. But you look at the 2016 field that was primary in Trump, and all these people were strong on
      paper, and they just didn’t have the right stuff. But you can’t find this stuff out without an
      opportunity. And this is a party that has not given people an opportunity now for over two decades.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It does mean that we have this incredibly polar both… It’s funny, we have both polarization in
      terms of the two World War I trench warfare sort of situation, and status quo or a static situation
      at the top. Where we’re literally seeing the renomination of one 80-year-old president, and the
      renomination of the preceding previous president from the other party who’s 77. So has there ever
      been a kind of more, I don’t know what you’d call it, a backward looking situation? To have two
      massive phalanxes each being led by people more than 75. And then beneath the surface, one has the
      impression, and in the real country, in the real world, massive instability and fluidity in terms of
      where we might be going? It seems to be… It’s an untenable situation, right, don’t you think?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Well, I’ll be brief here. I don’t want to go on too long.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Just two things I’d say. First is, 100 years from now, when people look back at Trump and what’s
      going on here, they’re not going to be talking about Trump. What they’re going to be talking about
      is, what was going on in America that enabled someone like Donald Trump to become president. So I
      think Trump is more the symptom of what’s going on in the country, than the cause. And in terms of
      trying to explain where we are and what’s going on, I’ll just really quickly. We’re going through
      the biggest transition in our country since the late 1800s, when we went from an agrarian society to
      an industrial society. It’s a 30 or 40 year transition. In the short term you have a few winners and
      a lot of losers. We’re going through the same kind of transition now, from a 20th century top-down
      manufacturing industrial society, to a 21st century digital and global one. It’s the biggest
      transition over 100 years. We’re in a transitionary moment in our history right now. 10 out of the
      last 12 election cycles, the country’s voted to either change control of the house, senate, and/or
      president. And so, they’re voting against who’s in power now, who’s forward in power. And we are in
      this transition period that we’re going to break out of this transition period. As we settle into
      this 21st century digital global world, you see all kinds of things that are happening that are
      going to open up opportunities for people they haven’t had. And the turn of this last century, we
      created high schools in America to train people to work on these machines. You’re seeing as an
      example now, companies and state governments all across America, that are now waiving the
      requirement that someone’s a college graduate to get a job. Because that’s the only way they could
      in the past figure out if someone’s qualified. But being a college graduate has nothing to do with
      filling these jobs now. So we’re transitioning. And so, this has been a 20 year transition due to
      the economic changes, the technological changes, the demographic changes, all coming together at the
      same time. But in the wide swath of history, 20 years is nothing. But when you’re living in the
      middle of it, you feel it’s like unbelievable chaos. So the point is, we are going to push through
      this, and we are going to come to the other side. And a lot of it’s going to have to do with the
      baby boomers, and the remnants of the Greatest Generation dying off. And these emerging generations
      are going to take power, and we’re going to change and we’re going to get out of this. But we’re
      still going to be in this barrel for several more cycles. And that’s what Trump and Biden
      represents, which is our transitionary figures that as a country, politics are lagging indicators.
      We will never get to the other side politically until we get to the other side in terms of who we
      are as a country and what people care about. Once we do that, the politics will change. And that’s
      why early the beginning of the next decade, the issues that poll well right now that don’t matter in
      elections like climate control, gun control, abortion, all these social libertarian issues, they’re
      going to be driving the outcome of elections next decade. Because the people that are going to be
      running this country care about that. And these are the emerging younger generations, but they’re
      not quite at the tipping point yet of taking over.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s really well said. And I’m more hopeful, we just have to assume we make it through this
      rather rocky period.
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      Bill, I’ll tell you, I know we’re wrapping up here. What do you say we give a speech there are three
      roles, that I’m sure your familiar. One is, you got to show up on time. Two is, you don’t want to
      offend your host. And three is, you want to have them feeling better after the speech than before.
      And I’ve had a really hard time on that third one. I’m not so great on the second one either, by the
      way. I’ve had a really hard time with trying to figure out how you leave people feel a little better
      after the speech than before. And there are two ways that I do that. One’s the positive way that I
      just described, in terms of where we’re headed as a country. And people joke about millennials and
      generations here, they’re actually way more aligned with the greatest generation and sense of
      communitarianism, and about caring more about community and what their values are. So that’s a very
      positive way, I think, to feel good about the long-term future of the country. And then there’s a
      negative way to feel positive. Which is, despite all our problems, I’d rather have America with our
      problems, compared to any other country in the world by far. I mean, we have a lot of problems. But,
      my God, we have strengths which is largely built around our people, and at least up until now around
      a legal system that’s independent. And also the entrepreneurial spirit that made America to what it
      is, is still the DNA of our country. So I’m quite optimistic if we can get to the other side, that
      we’re going to be able to turn the corner and reach our potential again. But we are in this three-
      decade trough right now of going from one era to another, and getting new institutions that are
      responsive to people, what they care about, so that we can rebuild trust in our country and all of
      our institutions, but particularly our governmental and political goals.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s good. No, I’m going to think a lot about this somewhat hopeful vista and vision over the next
      eight months as I look at the actual candidates and choices we face, and debates and everything
      else, conventions we’re going to have. But no, look, it’s a very important point and a good point
      that you make. And it’s not just for leaving people happy after one gives a speech, though I agree
      with that. I’m falling short on that too. They always do want you to leave the audience. “These
      people didn’t come to hear you just get them… Leave them depressed. They’re going out to play golf
      after your lunch speech, and they want to be in a good mood.” It’s like, “I’ll do my best.” But you
      did your best, and it’s a very serious point, it’s a good point. But meanwhile, we’ll need to get
      together maybe what, midsummer, to see where we are. What would be the time where we’ll really know
      much more about the shape of things to come before the conventions, I guess?
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      So, I remember when I was in the White House, you always want to be strategic and not tactical. And
      a big part of that is, planning, going from election day and working backwards. And then looking at
      to the extent you can, what are the phases that we’re dealing with, and how are we going to win the
      phases? Now, this was over 30 years ago, I wrote a speech in the summer of ’95 about the phases of
      the election that, I gave that same speech for 15 months. Because the phases were the phases, they
      never change. It’s a little harder in this environment to do that. I haven’t thought a great deal
      about this. But, the way I would look at this in terms of tranches or phases that I would want to
      try to control if I were in the White House is, we’ll have the… You mentioned Super Tuesday. I don’t
      know what the date will be, but sometime probably in early to mid-March, there’ll be the consensus
      that the election, general election is starting. It’s the formality, there’s no Nikki Haley, there’s
      whatever. So, we’re going to have a… This is the beginning of the election early morning, that’s one
      phase. I guess I would probably make a second phase maybe to early June or something like that,
      roughly, mid-June. And that’s really, I think, we’ll know where the court stuff is with Trump. I
      think we’re going to have a pretty good idea where the economy is headed towards September and
      election day at that point. And so, we’ll move into the summer with the Republican Convention and
      the Democratic Convention. It’s sort of a second phase. And then I think the third phase will be
      late August immediately following the Democratic Convention in Chicago. That third tranche will be
      the general, the final lap for the general election, as I mentioned earlier, when you’ll see people
      voting. A lot of people voting in September, and certainly by mid-October. So that’s how I would
      look at the cycle in those three phases.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, it’s very, very helpful, really. And we’ll get together maybe in June, I think, and let’s see
      where we are in the economy, the-
  - speaker: Doug Sosnik
    text: |
      A lifetime from now.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …and it will be. God knows, as you say, last time we talked October 7th hadn’t happened, and all
      kinds of other things since Trump was in question, and Biden might not run. So, Doug Sosnik, thank
      you very much for joining me today. Really a fascinating conversation.
