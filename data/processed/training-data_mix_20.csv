kqH4oM8uhqI,2025,Ryan Goodman," We're seeing things that I would never have imagined, masked, militarized forces on American streets, snagging people and putting it in the back of vans. And we know that at a minimum, two things, one, they're not going after hardened criminals because they're trying to meet their quotas and two, they're at a minimum making a bunch of mistakes. So we even have multiple justice department, filings in court, emitting to administrative errors of getting the wrong people and in fact sending them to like C cut prison in El Salvador and elsewhere. And that is not only the country that we're living in today, which is to me like this internal security force. I started some of my academic career and practice on human rights. I mean, that's the kind of stuff we were seeing in the Americas with when you talked about the military it was actually the internal military. And the ICE is, and not only are we seeing that, but we're on the cusp of tens of billions of dollars being infused into ICE right at the moment that this is all happening, just to ramp up that force. And once you do that, I'm not quite sure why you need the Marines because they seem so pumped up in a very militaristic way and both in their fatigues and their heavy arms and including in instances in which they're going to a home depot or whatnot to arrest just very ordinary people."
LheEa0iNiI0,1232,Ryan Goodman," the unitary executive, the idea that the president controls vertically everything within the executive branch and therefore the court is going to in all likelihood they've already signaled this through their decisions, give the president the power to remove people from multi-member independent agencies at will whenever he wants to without cause. That's one building block that they've been building for a long time now. And then I guess the other one is the Casa Decision, which is just a few days old while we're talking and that's the decision that says that court should not intrude on the executive branch through issuing nationwide or universal injunctions. And my view of that one is it's not trying to hand something to Trump. It's just the way that they were going to go. At some point they were going to go in that direction they've been signaling it for years and it's one of the cases in which I thought if you actually get down deep into the case surely to goodness, even if that's what they want. And there's reasonable minds definitely can come out with the idea that nationwide injunctions are bad. They could have also said, well in this particular instance of birthright citizenship we're going to still find against the Trump administration. There are a couple ways they could have easily done that and they didn't do it. And so I think Trump is supercharged after that opinion. That's where I think it's like not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House."
P9ylrEMLAOA,3110,Ray Takeyh," It has paid a huge price for his great power allies, China and Russia. It sells oil at discount to the Chinese. The Chinese are very exploitative in their relationship with Iran, and that doesn't sit well with Iranian people, because they're limited to Chinese products which they don't like, and they're selling their oil at the discount rate to the Chinese multinationals. And in terms of the Russian Federation, Iran was involved in a war in Central Europe, for which it had no particular interest at stake, ideological or practical. What happened to those great power allies that were supposed to come together? What happened to this access that was supposed to be so regenerating? And the Russians have offered to mediate. The Chinese have issued the ritualistic statement by their foreign ministry saying that conflict should stop and cooler history prevail. So that's another alliance that Iran had invested a great deal in. It saw itself as part of this new anti-American access. They came to the Russians aid. They shipped a lot of drone technology to China, which they could have used today. And the Russians all they did was offer to mediate this dispute and call for comms. So that's another angle that hasn't worked out for the regime at such."
Lzq5409v0zw,5340,Ray Takeyh," In the past two or three years, Israelis have turned all the assumptions on their head. In the past three years, Israelis have essentially proven that force and power can work. In the past years, Israelis have proven that everything you taught in your American university about the release is not true. Once they demolish his Bola, it made this attack possible. I do think, frankly, Israelis are probably surprised at their own tactical success, because I think all of us Israelis included had discounted, had deep deraught wars in the Islamic Republic, had institutions had decayed so much. So, yes, it would not have happened, I think, without the Israeli daring attacking against his Bola."
SgcLmozMpY8,3979,Eric Edelman," Susan Glasser of the New Yorker captured it very well in her letter from Washington this week in which she said, the trip that demonstrated that Trump really has no particular foreign policy doctrine. I mean, he was very critical of the Gulf Petro state monarchies that he traveled to in 2016 when he was running president. He criticized Hillary Clinton for taking money from some of these states, including Qatar. He obviously has no problem with it now, including this gift. But as Susan Glasser wrote, it's the perfect symbol for the trip because he has no doctrine. He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this cuttery, you know, luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trump as a material the substance of Trump."
tI85IxhxDSY,2028,Eric Edelman," Now in the meeting with El Shara, the president did ask for some of the things we would want from a new Syria, or instance normalization. With Israel, have Syria join the Abraham Accords and become another neighbor of Israel it has made peace with it. It would be like Egypt and Jordan and the UAE, Bahrain, other states surrounding Israel in the region. That would be a good thing. He asked for El Shara to expel some of the foreign jihadis who helped El Shara come to power, but who have since been engaged in intercommunal violence in Syria that has troubled observers who would like to see a stable Syria. He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias that with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations to reintegrate them into the Syrian armed forces and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who if left untended could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria. He asked for all of those very important things."
QScoIOT1QRA,5022,John Bolton," What Trump has done when you add all this together, when you add in his policies on Ukraine, when you look at the things he said about NATO and our alliance structures, and the things he said about making Canada the 51st state, the way he's completely messed up the whole Greenland issue, which is of importance to American national security, threatening to invade Panama, saying he was gonna take the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera, the Mediterranean. He is burning through decades of effort to build up goodwill, trust, faith, reliance on America. Our friends all over the world are saying, you've taken leave of your senses. I think some have overreacted, and I think that's a mistake. It's Trump that's the problem. It's not the American people. Much of what Trump is doing, they didn't vote for in November and they don't like now. We'll get through Trump. There is a life after Trump. We will then try and repair the damage he's done. People shouldn't overreact to this, but in the tariffs and all these many other things, it's not just the economic consequences for the US. It's the loss of what makes America exceptional. Again, very few people have talked about this. Ken Griffin has stood up and said, Trump is damaging brand USA. That's how a business guy would think about it, and it's an aspect of it. But it's just the faith in us as a country that we've accumulated since 1945. You can just see it disappearing in front of your eyes."
5gvHhCPUxK8,10148,John Bolton," As Vladimir Putin has shown, he's still a master manipulator of Trump. Xi Jinping hasn't made his play yet, but we may not be far from seeing that given the potential for a tariff war between the US and China. And there are a lot of other players out there that are seeing this chaos, and they see chaos in the four of the administration too. They know that affects decision-making and increases the chance that they will do something they think we may not even notice let alone respond to."
TR_XSOHfW7c,16880,John Bolton," I think Hague Seth's performance has been so far below expectations that despite some initial moves like removing the chairman of the joint chiefs and taking pictures off the walls and things like that, or former secretaries and defense, which is just silly, and I think regarded as silly. There hasn't been as much disruption as there might have been. Now there are things that are coming that are not good. I don't think the military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, which coincidentally is the anniversary of the formation of the army is a good idea. It didn't happen in the first term, although Trump talked about it a lot, and I think that was a good thing for the country. It will not be a good thing to have this parade. And there are people in the defense department in policy-making positions in civilian ranks who are as bad as JD Vance and Tulsi Gabbard on a lot of our national security issues."
ANlH4VHJXYI,6645,Larry Summers, nearly a month since Liberation Day is that there is no evidence zero of markets accommodating themselves to these policies. All the good news when there has been good news has come from a sense that there's going to be a policy reversal. None of it has come from a sense that well we really are going to impose the tariffs. There really is going to be some kind of American Renaissance. Zero of it has that character. All of it is well maybe they won't go through with this crazy stuff. Maybe they'll back off here. Look they backdoor there. Look they're sending signals that they're just going to declare victory and not do anything real. So that is the disturbing thing.
lOjcEGL4Oqo,5453,Jason Furman," The conceptual error is that every time the United States has a trade deficit with a country, that is evidence that the other country is doing something wrong and hurting us and taking advantage of us. That is the core idea here and the core thing the president is trying to solve. I don't think he'll solve it by the way. And just to give an example of this, take Madagascar. We run a trade deficit with Madagascar right now. They sell us vanilla beans. They don't buy very much from us, mostly because they're really poor. We're not going to make America great again by selling more to Madagascar. We've now put a huge tariff on Madagascar. What will that mean? Probably won't mean that they buy more of our stuff and make America rich. It means we're going to buy less vanilla beans and have less of that in our country. And so a lot of these trade patterns just have to do with what country has what? What country is able to do what? What country has comparative vantage, resource endowment, and instead Donald Trump thinks it's unfair and we can make ourselves rich by doing something about it. Everyone makes different things. Everyone buys and sells different things. Now, there's the aggregate trade deficit. You could argue that that's too high, but that's too high, mostly because we're borrowing too much from the rest of the world. And the main thing driving that borrowing is our budget deficit. So if you wanted to worry about the overall trade deficit, you actually want to look to underlying macroeconomic drivers. But that, of course, is the opposite of what they're doing."
SC7Uug1Wq8I,2715,Jason Furman," I don't think it's the end of days or Armageddon, but that's not to say that our Turkey is a good idea. You know, not starving to death is a pretty low bar. You know, not having Armageddon is a pretty low bar. So what we're talking about here is, you know, some meaningful short run pain. If you're in the markets, that might be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars lost. If it's just your income and purchasing power, I'm you're talking about a couple thousand dollars lost. Then it's not just short term pain, long term, there's also more pain. This might be just a couple tenths off of our economic growth rate per year because we have less globalization. Well, a couple tenths really accumulates over time. I mean, the way I think about it is the United States and Argentina were quite similar in the year 1900. They're very different now. Why? Because the United States grew 0.7% percentage point per year faster than Argentina, year in and year out. And so if this moves us sort of one-third of the way to Argentina, that wouldn't be a good thing."
qYn8_N1yDZI,9807,A.B. Stoddard," I do find among my friends and peers and family people who are not following this closely, they believe that there's like this 100-day sprint and then it will end and that I think that they believe there's some guardrails that are going to magically appear like airbags in a car accident. And 2ZWiles, the Chief of Staff, will have a conversation with a very high ranking person of the CIA and all this nonsense will be stopped. That's not what happens. It accelerates and it grows because the more power you give and the more it'll take and the less pushback he gets, the freer he is. And so I think what we've seen in the last couple of months is that he's been given permission and he will take it. That's where Trump is. And he believes his pathologies create a story for him that this is what the people want. Now they adore everything he does."
CUHJXnlKohI,4951,A.B. Stoddard," This talk of the third term, and whether or not your vote is going to count, I think, alongside to kitchen table issues is absolutely essential to try to educate the public on what's coming. The Trump in the end intends to control the rule of law, the courts, you know, everything, but he wants to control elections and he wants to find a way to a third term. I don't care for publicans and say, of course he's saying that he doesn't want to be in lame ducks, so he doesn't really need it. And the 22nd Amendment, no, Democrats have to push this into the debate. Okay, Republican, Congressman, or Senator, are you really opposed to him running a third time? Do you want him when he's 82 to run again when you said Biden couldn't? Where are you? We need you on the record. What will you do to stop it? I'm with Liz Cheney. He never intends to leave. He intends to die there. That's my belief. You'll have other guests on this show that disagree and you don't have to agree with me. That's my 100% opinion. I don't waver on that."
FrdJxgUjpcA,2519,Steve Vladeck," This is not business as usual and it's not close to business as usual. And if you look for business as usual, you'd have real trouble finding business as usual. The overarching problem is not any one particular thing that Trump and the executive branch have done over the last 50 days. It's all of it. It's the aggregation. We've seen individual flashpoints for some of these legal controversies before Bill. We've seen presidents claim the power to not spend at least certain money Congress has appropriated, we've seen firings that have been controversial, if not unlawful. But we've never seen it at this scale and we've never seen such a wholesale attempt on the part of a president, basically to clear out and hollow out the executive branch. We've never seen, I think, such a wholesale effort to install loyalists in all of the relevant positions of government. Not to sort of put this all on the executive branch, we've never seen Congress, I think so completely abandoned its own institutional interest, even though we may have been sliding toward that for years."
4jTP4hKE0pY,8075,Steve Vladeck," No matter how things go from here, even on the optimistic account, we're going to look back at this period with a lot of regret and a lot of woe. But, right, the critical point, and I think this is a point that is underscored by history, is the time to sort of lay down the marker and stand up, is earlier rather than the later. You fight the war not when it's best for you to fight it. You fight the war when you can minimize the damage. Minimizing the damage isn't going to make everybody whole, but we should be all invested in minimizing the damage at this point, as opposed to any scenario where Trump has given more of an opportunity to make it worse."
yiG4oMsgULM,16199,Anne Applebaum," In terms of whether the Europeans can help Ukraine, and the answer is yes, their help has been really key so far. Missing peace is that Europeans are part of NATO and the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO is an American. So all of the decision-making processes all run through the United States, the assumption that the US would lead has been part of the NATO structure. Rethinking that structure or rethinking how Europe could act together differently outside of that structure is not something you can do in five minutes. I mean, there is something like a coalition of the willing emerging, and it certainly includes Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Poland, now Germany, UK, France, maybe Italy, maybe Spain, they're a little farther away from the war and they don't feel it is sharply. There's clearly a group of countries who feel directly that Russia is a threat to them, economically, as I said, in cyber, in sabotage in many other ways, and you'll see them working together. They will be making heavy defense investments. I mean, the big argument in Germany is gonna be how much money can we finally borrow money? Germans have weird rules about debt. You're not allowed to have debt in Germany. Maybe it attempt to create a defense bank. I mean, basically, they need a lot more defense spending right now."
0Z3btxMQjGc,16043,Anne Applebaum," This is not a conservative movement. This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are skeptical of science. They are skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. There's a quality of difference. You see online, people saying, oh well, you know, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement. No, this is not. This is a break from the conservative movement. It's a break from 80 years of foreign policy. It's a break from more than 100 years of having an independent civil servant."
GaY7PuSd8jg,1292,Renée DiResta," Elon Musk, when he bought Twitter, significantly changed how content was weighted in the feed. Blue checks, all of a sudden were for sale, and their content would be ranked higher, their replies would be ranked higher. People could monetize influencers who wanted to make money, wanted to be more sensational, and then the algorithm would curate that because people would engage with it. And so you would see a very different style, like your feed, when people say my feed on X is totally different now, that's because the incentives are different, and the way that it's ranked is different. And the person who controls that is X, which is now owned by one person. So what's the alternative? It's to move to platforms where you have better control over your own feed. Blue Sky is really the only thing that's doing that. It's new. I think it's still kind of red as like, live Twitter because of the sort of early adopters. I think threads is starting to get at, again, this like here are different ways that you can view your feed. Maybe other platforms will start to move into that mode."
S31giVAfZpk,881,Renée DiResta," I had an anti-vaccine account so I could follow anti-vaccine news without it polluting my main feed. A mad account would get recommended flat-earth content. It would get recommended chemtrails content. And then I would join the flat-earth and the chemtrails groups. And this account never posted. It just joined. After the chemtrails, I started getting pizza gate, right? This was around the election around 2015, 2016 timeframe. The Hillary Clinton emails and all that stuff. And so I wind up with pizza gate. I locked back in thing I wanted to get some screenshots related to some chemtrails stuff that I was paying attention to. I wound up seeing QAnon content. And this was before QAnon was really in the news. It's this progression. So if you like one conspiracy, the algorithm thinks you'll like other conspiracies. Exactly. QAnon wouldn't have existed to the extent that it does today without the recommendation engines pushing all of those people into those groups. There were many of them by that point because the algorithms were bringing them together. Well, conspiracy theorists will talk all day long because they're in there digesting the Q-drop figure out where the pedophiles are, where the children are, whatever."
2qJcH4Sh35A,5810,Ryan Goodman," from a legal perspective, the most important element is the executive authority that the Trump administration is claiming. And what I mean by that is what constitutional power are they asserting behind all of these executive orders that is different in character than anything that's proceeded at including the first Trump administration? We had a piece published at Jess Security. I thought it was one of the most important pieces we published since January 20th, which is by the former dean of NYU Law Trevor Morrison and Adam Cox, two of the most level-headed legal scholars. And their entire piece is actually looking at these executive orders across the board and then saying, actually, there's an assertion here of what they call a quote unquote dictatorial theory of executive authority, meaning that the Trump team is claiming that just as president, he can completely override congressional statute. The first branch of government doesn't matter."
1wb8pTEGTD8,2080,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick," when you look at the National Guard, which is many of them proposed, National Guard troops don't wanna do this. I think it's pretty easy to say you don't join the National Guard because you wanna go around rounding up grandmas. That is a major challenge for the United States if they go down that path of trying to co-opt the military for this. You know, National Guard recruiting is already difficult. Military recruiting is down significantly. Military recruiting is in many ways the highest among immigrant communities. And there are very high numbers of people with green cards and others coming from, you know, immigrant backgrounds joining the military by comparison to people who've been here for a few generations. So if they actually start using the military to go into immigrant communities, you could be ordering a National Guard troop to go arrest their own family member. I mean, I don't think that's particularly likely scenario, but it's the kind of thing that would, you know, hurt the US, I think a lot more than people are really thinking about."
YjaPyQIshwc,8924,John Bolton," President got elected, he runs the executive branch. You might or might not like some policy, a subordinate or a cabinet member is advocated, but if the president advocated, he's entitled to a person who agrees with him in the position. The role of the Senate, and I think is envisioned by the framers, was to look at competence and moral fitness for the job, where a lot of these nominees had trouble. Part, this was Trump induced because his people were saying, he's totally in charge, he's invincible, he's gonna get whatever he wants, these 53 Republican senators, just a bunch of wicks, spittles, and they'll acquiesce very quickly, and then they did so difference between, at the high bar of expectations, what happens was pretty dramatic. That's why I think a gathered in particular is vulnerable, and that may bring some people back down to earth, and he'll get better advice on the politics of navigating the Senate than he's gotten so far."
7B8svXBm8CY,23073,John Bolton," He does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy. He thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc, transactional, episodic, inconsistent, and there's been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, well, he's gotten worse over time. He got worse during the first four years. He got worse during the intervening four years. I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term. He now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. His focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good. That's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years, because that's always got."
OjJ-m5icwIg,4049,Ron Brownstein," I take it as performancely will influence both. Even the most spirited campaign couldn't overcome a negative verdict on Biden's performance. If Trump is a success, Republicans will be in a very strong position in 2028. If in fact he goes ahead with massive tariffs and mass deportation that cause inflation to spike again, and if he pursues a series of these policies that people continue to express reservations about, but kind of hope wouldn't happen. Or, you know, the cultural gains among Latino men are probably real. The decline was so uniform. Says to me that it was bigger than anything targeted at any one group, right? It was essentially a shared national verdict on the past four years. If that's the cause, if that's the driving factor, then the shared national verdict on the next four years is gonna be the most important factor in 2028."
YgCjoJWg1Ak,5274,Ron Brownstein," The magnitude of it was startling. Everyone expected in states that weren't being fought. Trump would improve whether they were blue states or red states because you can't have 75% wrong track, 60% disapproval of the president and not have an erosion of his party's position. But the idea that you could hive off or put the swing states under a dome and in those states you could counteract the underlying trend by spending money to focus people on what they didn't like about Trump. That worked in 2022. It worked to a slight extent in 2024, but not nearly to the extent they needed. And essentially we saw a nationwide uniform verdict. Voters were dissatisfied with what they got over the past four years. And whatever doubts they had about the alternative, that seemed to them less risky than continuing on the course that we are on. As we have seen in elections like Carter, HW Bush stability is risk."
ztqRX-WTHQg,3136,Ron Brownstein," Harris is winning the campaign, the candidate war, and the campaign, better campaign. Trump's winning the paid media or the other judge. Like the week before the first debate, a Republican strategist said to me, if we win this election, it won't be because of the interactions between Trump and Harris, either at the debates or in the day-to-day driving of the news cycles. If we win the election, it will be because we basically run the campaign against her that we've run against Democrats for Senator and Governor forever in these swing states, basically portraying them as an extreme cultural liberal who are soft on prime immigration and won't keep you safe. It's basically like whatever craziness is happening around Trump. You know what he's talking about? You know, Arnold Palmer's junk or animal lector, whatever is happening with Trump himself. That campaign, that ad campaign is like motoring forwards. It's the terminator."
dnMGLuU29LM,1799,Ron Brownstein," The exception of John Kerry in 2004, Democrats in this century have won women voters by somewhere between 11 to 13 points, pretty consistently Biden pushed that up a little higher, maybe to 15 points. Harris might push it up a little more than that, and it is possible that Trump will run a little better with men than he did last time because you are seeing improvements certainly among Latino men. He is gonna run better with Latino men than he did last time. Maybe a little bit better with black men and probably somewhat better among young white men. You know, younger white men that he's put a lot of effort into courting, I would not be surprised if Harris wins women by more than Biden did and loses men by more than Biden did."
a4Lm5LW4Rfk,1960,Jason Furman," We're in a place in the United States right now where if all we had was our native born workforce, we would have shrinking employment. Every month you would wake up and you would get the jobs number and it would be a negative number. I mean, that wouldn't even be because you're in recession. That would just be because some people were getting older and retiring and the fertility rate is below two. So you're below the replacement rate you need. So the only reason that we're not Japan that we have a growing workforce is because of immigrants. I don't think it's great that we've created an economic system that basically can't function without undocumented immigrants. I would much rather that we have a lawful system that expands legal immigration. As part of that expansion, you could weight it more heavily towards a point type system based on on skill-based immigration, but I think there's a lot of room for a lot of different types. And then at the same time, you can tighten up the border. It's not something Harris seems to want to go near. And then Donald Trump, he wants to expel a lot of people in this country, which I think would be inhumane."
5YfICpVlFKE,18546,James Carville," What I think she has license to do is I think the point is whatever we consider it's a base will allow her greatly way in appealing to more online voters. And that's that it in Trump doesn't have in abortion. He's caught. He doesn't have very much strategic space at all. Because if he goes one way, the pro-life people get furious, he goes another way in the people that he needs to supplement his base get furious. He sees he's caught in a pretty, pretty bad place there. And I can't think of an issue where she doesn't have space to operate."
QIa9noVgK1E,10998,James Carville," actually think that the demographic that may have the most elasticity in this cycle might be white college nails. A, that they are tended to be much more pro-choice than non-college white males. B, they're probably doing because of the markets and other stuff of them. I don't have figured in front of them, but I'm pretty safe in saying that more college white males and stock market than other demographics. And then we are the least fashionable demographic in America. But you could listen to NPR for two weeks and not even know that we exist. All right, but I do think there's some elasticity and upward movement for her among college white males."
p4Xj_pNilJI,2864,Doug Sosnik," There are seven states that are considered the most competitive. She's clearly much more competitive in the Sunbelt States. There's were all kind of loss for Biden by the time the debate was happening, certainly after the debate. And these are safe, disproportionately younger voters and non-wife voters. And those are the groups that left Biden compared to how they voted in 2020. She's largely gotten most of those back. The question is, oh, in those states, is she able now to make them much more competitive, but fall short? And then you go to the Midwestern states, where there's some evidence that she's running behind the Biden was with these nine-college whites. She could end up in the worst of both worlds, where she does well enough in the Sunbelt to make it really close, but not win. And then in the West Belt States, the margins work against her."
q_pTEUy6o7g,1079,Doug Sosnik," Harris is currently winning the fight to define what this campaign is about. So far, she is winning the battle about the campaign being about change and as she is the change candidate and making the campaign about the future and not about the past. I think she's also done an excellent job of defining who she is on her terms. Prior to the convention, I think there was a stellar rollout and I think the convention was was hitting on all the points that she was attempting to make before it. And so I think while not complete, she's off to a very good start and the polling reflects the significant uptick and favorable views towards Harris although it's not solidified."
1_m2f9kJkhw,13161,James Carville," something is going on at Marlago. I'm not sure what it is, you know, that was that Black journalist thing. You know, some people actually think that was planned. If it disguised Las Sivitas, Susie Walsh, they're not stupid. I mean, if one elections before, all right? And what's coming out of there? They don't know where to go. They let it get away from them. I mean, if you and I were running that campaign, we looked at, I'd say, Bill, but there are three things can happen. Biden dropped out its Harris. Biden drops out its open thing, but you would have a plan that you would pull off the shelf. From what little bit I can read, they were just standing there feeling good about themselves and then they got hit in the mouth and then there was no concerted, organized, thought out reaction, which is pretty amazing."
DuuilC1-e00,9287,James Carville," parts of the Democratic Party, not Joe Biden, not Democratic primary voters, lost their minds. And everybody thought this was the wave of the future. The identity politics had been essential to any discussion of politics. And of course, it was a giant mistake. She bought into that. And you know, to a guy like me, you could see this coming. So I went back and looked in April 27th, 2021. I did an interview on box and I said, this stuff is killing us. This is the dumbest thing that you can imagine. And I, you know, I'll give myself credit. I was right. You know, I called defund the police to three stupidest words in the history of English language. And of course, no one's talking about it now."
pwbii06y9hg,3370,Doug Sosnik," Let's say Trump wins. If you said to me, when was the defining moment in this election? I would say was in the summer of 2021. Trump, never for a day had a job approval of over 50 percent. Biden had job approval from the mid to high fifties from January 20th taking office until beginning of July 2021. There was a confluence of events that really sort of defined the Biden presidency politically. Substitutely, I think he's going to be in great shape 40 years from now. People look back at what he accomplished, but we're talking about the politics of getting reelected. Starting with the 4th of July, where essentially Biden declared victory over COVID and told the country we'd be back to normal Labor Day. August, you had the withdrawal of Afghanistan. September was the first month that we had over 6 percent inflation. And then at the end of September, early October was the beginning of supply chain problems. I went under water in those 90 days and essentially never recovered."
L3nMbqv3Aao,1232,Doug Sosnik," She's got to consolidate the base first. She's got to pull together the parties and reassure people that she's up to the task. To me, if I'm looking at this from the Harris standpoint, I want to create a really positive first impression for the country, because most people don't know her, and also for kind of lapsed Democrats. But I view the target here is to neutralize the inherent advantages Trump has in the short term. It works as quickly as possible to secure the de facto nomination. I want to be out there as fast as I can to try to define her. But the tipping point for me about how to win this election is how the party leaves Chicago at the end of the convention. And leaves Chicago as sort of a normal candidate who's been running for president for a while, which I think is doable, but damn hard, that to me would be the goal of our running the Harris operation."
eqrdSzSM3zs,1338,John DiIulio," What was it called with my guy? We said that wars the continuation of politics by other means they see administration public administration as the continuation of politics by other means. And for 46 years now, the civil service reform act of 78, that's been the battleground. That's been, you know, the ground zero in partisan and ideological battles over the extent to which the president can and should control the federal bureaucracy and its workforce and the concomitant battle over unionization public employee unionization. Schedule F, however, is not just the latest salvo in this battle. It is really the first use of nuclear, rather than conventional weapons. I can go through and talk about what I think it purports to accomplish, how it purports to accomplishment and accomplish it and why the key underlying understanding or the background facts really don't support it."
o_-ANM_9k2A,5422,James Carville," The age issue is going to be huge. All right, and up to it out there. Nancy Pelosi, Stenyoria, Jim Clyburn, Al Ruzzi, and Epoch. All of them are younger than Biden would be at the end of the second term. As of this moment, there's 33 million, 361,000, four-hundred and eleven people that live in the United States. Could we please find somebody under 75 to be our president, Harris? She should obviously be a top-tier candidate, As Wood Gavin Newsom, you know, Jay-Enzli, Jared Pugas, Amy Klogechar. I'll give you one that I would look at real close, JB Prescott. All right, Gretchen Whitman, not Big Gretchen. I mean, probably the most successful Democratic state anywhere in the country. I mean, she has a hell of a story to tell."
lr_87GS9KjE,6972,Anne Applebaum," Part of the difficulty is that it's not like there are these two geographic blocks, you know, and there's a Berlin wall that divides them. In fact, there are different actors on both sides, and we have autocratic actors inside the United States, and there are democratic actors inside Russia. And you have to think of it more. It's not a cold war. I actually very much dislike this cold war 2.0 language. You know, it's not about just lining up all our ducks on one side and shooting at the other side. It's not going to be like that. A lot of fighting the war is going to be about internal reform, making our system more resilient, and doing so together with other allies in Europe and Asia, and even working with democratic movements in other places in Russia, in Iran, in China, and so on. And so beginning to think like that, and I think we're still really just at the beginning."
SDP3hr8dIvs,1647,Jason Furman," The one place that former President Trump has been completely explicit is on tariffs. He's spelled out exactly what he do, which is 10% tariffs on every single country in the world and every single thing that we buy from them. So what would this do? It would raise consumer prices, which would obviously show up as inflation. It would lead to reactions. There's not like other countries are going to sit there standing still and just let us put tariffs on. They're going to put tariffs on us. The net effect on things like American manufacturing are completely ambiguous and could easily be negative for a number of different reasons. You raise the price of steel and it makes it harder to make cars. The tariffs that we get on our exports will hurt American manufacturing. And overall, you look at the totality of his policies and for a variety of reasons, they would probably strengthen the dollar, which will make it harder for exports. And for manufacturing."
AWCVLqL63es,1056,Jason Furman," I just came back from a meeting with economic policy makers and economists in Europe, and they are just to a person incredibly jealous of the United States. They would love to have our short-term economic recovery. They'd love to have our longer-term productivity. They'd love to have our stock market. They would love to have our technology companies. We are just, we really, really are right now economically the envy of the world. I think it makes a lot of sense that we worry about our problems and figure out what we can do to make it even better. I don't think when voters go to the ballot box telling them you're in better shape than Germany means a whole lot, but we should be able to at least step back and say, well, we talk about all these problems and all these worries. The big picture is a really quite extraordinary American economy."
9gDYRFhwU-0,15137,Anne Applebaum," Instead of one war, there are now three wars. There is the Land War, which is the thing you read about the most. And in the Land War, Ukraine is very much still on the defensive. There is a second war, which is taking place in the Black Sea. And this is mostly Ukrainians using long-range missiles drones to attack Crimea and targets in and around Crimea. And then there's a third thing happening, which is very hard to understand, because we don't really have any good reporting on it. And this is almost like a long-range duel. So there's the Russians trying to hit Ukrainian power plants, Ukrainian infrastructure, and basically the Ukrainians trying to hit Russian infrastructure, and especially Russian oil refining capacity. So it's almost like there are these three spheres of the war, and Ukraine is doing not so well in the first, much better in the second, and the third is a kind of ongoing duel."
lCzRJPSRKeE,11455,Anne Applebaum," The interesting thing is we're talking about countries that do not share ideology. So communist China, nationalist Russia, theocratic Iran, but they do share a common interest and the common interest is undermining us and us, I mean America, Europe, the liberal world, the democratic world, because both because their own oppositions are inspired by and use democratic language and because chaos and uncertainty offer them business opportunities in the western world and increasingly they've concluded that what benefits them is the rise of illiberal and radical parties. When that happens, the western world or the democratic world loses its sense of community and solidarity, it loses its ability to make group decisions."
aznRJaopeKeE,6113,James Carville," the president's campaign, I think the economic messages, things are better than you think they are, which if left alone, maybe some consumer confidence numbers might look a little bit better, but you got to let people come to that conclusion, because if you come to the conclusion for them, and they don't think it's a good economy, they said, well, how can this guy fix something that he doesn't even think it's broke? There's no no message in that says, you're going to be happy with what you're going to see. He could say, we have unfinished work, I have a record to build on, not to sit on, but we've created a foundation by chips and new green energy projects and you know, they create anything like that, but have the some future conclusion that it's all going to get, it's all going to get better."
SSd86JwBTRc,2895,James Carville," They should run against MAGA and not Trump. MAGA is less popular than Trump. And what I would think that Biden's gonna say is you've been overtaken by this MAGA movement. We need a lot of people who voted for Trump. They're just not all of them are MAGA. And if we can drive a stake between MAGA and them, and them, we could get some of some could stay home because they're not comfortable with it. I think that's a potential to tie him to the movement because the movement is called NBC Poe is a 24% approved piece, 42. I think you have an opportunity there, but you gotta take opportunities at every point. And I think there's only so much Biden can do."
GNGzXKl-MzQ,20937,James Carville," The Democratic problem is, I don't see how we can replicate the 2020 coalition. In other words, 70 out of 100 people who voted in 2020 will under 30 and up that President Biden got 62%. Black was 12% share. So, about every 100 people had voted black, Biden got 90%. I don't think you're going to hit those numbers this year so you have to make it up somewhere else. Now, the good news is we do seem to be doing somewhat better with older whites, which is good because they vote, you know, higher than other people."
eihcQa6TUL0,19090,James Carville," The question it can it have an effect? The answer is yes. If he's acquitted or even to hang a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much don't know an acquittal would be very good for him, but if there's a guilty burden, that matters to people. And so people say well the hardcore Trump pickback probably not gonna affect the hardcore, but as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just Maga. And so a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat, they're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote."
_t6LDeGM6dE,10934,Robert Kagan," This is where Donald Trump, I think, is important. There were certainly other anti-liberal candidates available. But Trump is the one who has been able to capture this force because I think of his own peculiar personality. This guy introduced himself to the American public as a presidential candidate in 2011, as a white supremacist. And when he comes out on the birth of conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. They see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the liberal, the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America. That he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large."
27e77KuatmA,4865,Robert Kagan," Accepted in the 1920s, I think that the anti-liberal forces basically won and they did control the President's seat. And the 1924 Immigration Act is the most restrictive immigration act in American history and it very specifically not only focuses on only allowing white people in but only a certain kind. And so, you know, we've completely forgotten about this period, but it's an example of the fact that you can go backwards. And what undid that sort of triumph of white anti-liberalism were events. The Depression discredited the Republican and conservative movement followed by World War II, which discredited racism and really led to a huge flowering of liberalism in the wake of what had been a very dominant anti-liberal 1920s."
jtuWU_md-rE,2137,Frederick W. Kagan," The later we get into the year, the more possible it is to think about Ukrainians conducting counterattacks into stalling Russian offensive operations and starting to regain a little bit of of the initiative on the battlefield. There's a lot of variables there. militarily in terms of how a military operations work, it's very plausible. So it's, you know, so option number one is that we get into the fall, into the early fall and the Ukrainians actually are able to begin conducting some limited counterattacks, maybe very small counteroffenses to take advantage of failing Russian attacks. That would be optimistic. I can see other scenarios, possibly more realistic in which the Ukrainians focus on a spring counteroffensive. As bad as things look at the moment, it's still very conceivable to see how the Ukrainians could launch a counteroffensive and begin to take back territory, either, you know, late this year or into next year."
Mes-7RcVqWI,3663,Frederick W. Kagan," Odds are sometime in mid-delayed May, June. We'll see the start of another major Russian offensive operation. And the Ukrainians will have to weather that. The Russians are building a group of forces in the Algarod oblast, which is the Russian area directly north of Harki. And Ukrainians are talking about Russians preparing to drive on Harki city again, which they have not done since 2022. I personally skeptical that the Russians are going to be able to put together a large enough force really to threaten to take the city against equipped Ukrainian defenders. But that will draw Ukrainian forces away from other parts of the front and make defending against the whole thing challenging. Really pretty confident the Ukrainians are not going to lose the Harki or any major city and the front is not going to collapse. And we'll see what kind of ground and troops they lose."
B1fMutEVtGw,10545,Mark Esper," I think you have to take President Trump and any leader for that matter at their word. And Trump has been explicit with regard to what he would do. You know, with Ukraine, he said he cut off funding, cut off support. But he's also attacked NATO. Said it's not a good deal for the United States. I think he would pursue those things in the second term because he's unbound by the need to kind of play to a re-election. And so then the other big question becomes, who does he put in his cabinet? You know, myself and Mike Pompeo and John Bolton would talk him out of these things. Or times when it came to funding Ukraine trying to talk him into providing funding for Ukraine. So you know, keep part here is one him, but the opposite side of the coin or who are the people he brings around him, those are unknowns that we should be concerned about as this election unfolds."
wGWMGl_iP5I,3972,Defense Secretary," And as the election denialism continued, there was a growing concern that would the military get involved. And we all know now that there was a meeting in late December with Mike Flynn and others who said, yeah, maybe we should send the military to seize ballot boxes or to conduct another election. I can't recall the details, but it was quite alarming that the military would be putting that context. I was concerned going into the fall that the military would be used at the time of the election when the results were revealed to put down protests, to do other things. And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did. I mean, in my lifetime, if you had told me five, 10, 15, 20 years ago that there would be an insurrection on Capitol Hill and people would storm the Capitol and try and seize ballot boxes and threaten to hang Mike Pence the vice president, it would be like a bad Hollywood movie, right? But it was real and it should be a wake up call for all of us."
kTCmIXYLMBc,3218,Defense Secretary," I think one of the things that the Trump administration did well was approved providing javelins, for example, javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine. That came in very effective when the Russians invaded a few years later. But beyond that, we did a lot of training trying to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards. We had US forces, NATO forces there. I actually went to the city of Laviv in Western Ukraine where we were training them, spent a couple of days on the ground, talking to Ukrainians, talking to our people. So it was a great effort. And I believe as much as the weapons, training the Ukrainians to NATO standards, NATO tactics and techniques, when they would eventually go against a Russian army still using Soviet block tactics really made a big difference in the initial days of the war."
QkbrjeIS77g,4111,David Axelrod," You need to make this a very comparative campaign. You cannot allow this to be a referendum in an environment in which 65% of the country feels like things are on the wrong track. People need to understand this is a choice now. It's not a choice between him and the Almighty, it's him and the alternative, and the alternative is deeply, deeply flawed. I mean, Donald Trump is consumed by his past. His program for the future, he'd like people to feel that it's about the economy and immigration, but it's really about retribution and revenge. He has no sense of empathy. He views everything through the prism of Donald Trump. And that should be a real advantage for Joe Biden."
LDZr-3aFgb0,2754,David Axelrod," I suspect that if you're sitting around the kitchen table talking about the future of democracy, you're not worried about the cost of the food you're eating. You're not worried about your rent and your gas. I think ultimately the voters who care deeply about democracy and about Trump's sundering of it are going to vote for Joe Biden. I think that the real challenge for the Biden campaign is to reach people for whom that might not be the primary concern for whom I think principally economic issues are the concern, but also they have concerns about personal safety and many have concerns about the viability of their children's future and a lot of young people who are dissolution, you know, we talk about abortion rights, which is a motivator for young people."
A8b61KgROGs,6051,James Carville," How worried are you about? You mentioned to fund the police. You mentioned identity politics, cancel culture, whatever you want to call these things. The Democrats, parts of the Democratic Party coalition giving enough oxygen to that stuff that allows Republicans to just scream and yell about it for two years or four years and really have an effect. You think it didn't have an effect in 2020, down, certainly down ballot, right? It is the thing that I'm most familiar about. I had Ed Ruben-Guyego, who's a Democratic partisan Arizona, and we did much better in Arizona than we did in Texas Florida. He said, I've never heard about you. He's a word of T-next. And I think it's just not to wait. People talk. I mean, it's not what they, the English faculty at Amherst has too much power in this party. All right, they really do. And they come up with all of these different things. And when people see that, they don't like it."
4sTOW6dycDw,17706,James Carville," The thing that I really deeply disagree with is when people say, well, if it's not by an only alternative, we have this harsh. Oh, no, please. There is more the most skill presidential feel of our lifetime, I think, was clear to the 1980 Republicans. All right. I think the potential democratic 2024 skill feel could even be better. Not that they had the same kind of experience with the skill. Josh Shapiro is such a skill politician. It's like ridiculous. Andy Poshir is so freaking skilled. You at Westmore, Warnock, Gina Ramau, I hate to start naming nice because somebody called you and you said, well, you didn't mention me."
UVjX1ALdHzc,5522,James Carville," Once you vote two times of political party, that's it. You're done. I mean, it's meant so much research on that. And that's the point that you stick with 90 huge percentage. You could vote there for somebody when you were 22 and you voted again for that party when you're 26 and 66 you're going to be voting for the same party. I don't know, but I'm not going to have to you. Well, OK, you're not. But that's a that's a studied, settled thing in political science. It's not that hard to pick out. And then you're starting to see some of the commentators are starting to figure this out."
rqkn4-_YX0c,11920,Joe Klein," Well, I think Trump is probably, well, first of all, I've known the guy for 40 years. I covered real estate in New York back in the 80s and I can tell you that he was a joke to all of his fellow developers. He was not considered a major player. He was considered a major marketer. And we are living through the golden age of marketing. If this is the golden age of anything. And I think that it was inevitable that the American people would begin to mistake reality TV for reality."
J81Cp5G-eH0,13521,Timothy Snyder," And the last two years, the Ukrainians have done a lot for us. You know, they, they've, they've defended the international order. You know, the basic principle of national order is that countries shouldn't be invading other countries and, and, and changing territory. They have held off in large measure of genocide, where the Russians occupy. They have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people, holding off a genocide. It's not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. You know, it's, there won't be a war in Europe so long as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army because there's no way the Russian army can fight another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course it can. In my view, anyway, they've made a war with China much less likely because they're showing how offensive operations are complicated, unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist party that doesn't want to be embarrassed is going to pay attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who are willing to take risks for democracy."
2x0-ffRSA78,8345,Timothy Snyder," That's the only way to really think about a war is how do you finish it victoriously. And then where we are now, of course, is that we're not supplying anything. One German company is out producing us in terms of our Chillery shells. The North Koreans are out supplying the entire West. And we for our own political reasons, which are unfortunately connected to Russia's political reasons are at the moment not doing anything at all for Ukraine. What I want to stress is that we're like we're the weak link. America is the weak link. The Russians see us as the weak link and unfortunately they're correct. On the battlefield, the Ukrainians are doing, I would say, surprisingly well, they've cleared out a huge swath of the Russia's Black Sea fleet, which is allowing them to supply the Near East and Africa with food. They've destroyed a huge number of Russian aircraft in the last few weeks, largely if not entirely freeing the sky. The Russians are on the offensive now, but it's slow and it's it's costing them. So this is still a war that Ukraine can win, but whether or not they win it depends upon whether they have allies who are capable of seeing the political stakes."
v_NaFn7vx5c,4759,Garry Kasparov," I'm tempted to offer this kind of moral equivalence. Yes, yes, this will all wrong, so we also made mistakes. Yes, but Putin did that. But remember, Vietnam Americans did... Well, Trump, right, Trump. We've got the same colors too. But exactly. And that's the essence of fake news. That's an essence of Putin's propaganda machine because he's no longer selling you one right ideology. It's not like he's preaching communism or any other ideology. He's selling chaos. I call them merchant of doubts. Maybe we're lying. Everybody's lying. So this... Truth is unknown. You cannot find the truth because there's so many versions of that. And that's what brings the free world down because that gives a huge advantage to the other side that doesn't care about the rule of law and just about international treaties. Yes, we did that. But you know, somebody else did that. No, Crimea, but cost of..."
nPcTDh9EuPU,2004,Garry Kasparov," There is no common ground with people who do not share our values, period. Because it's the free world succeeded because we all had the same values. We could have differences between America and France or England or Germany after World War II. But the values were the same. So we relied on a free market, on rule of law, on democracy, on free and fair elections. And looking at others, we should recognize that it could be a temperous solution. But the temperous solution lasts only as long as we are strong. And if we show any sign of weakness, they will go after us. Because that's the way they can gain political capital. And democratic regimes need confrontation to justify their existence, especially if we deal with countries like Russia or North Korea, when they have one dear leader, leader who just must project strengths. And he cannot afford even the slightest moment of hesitations and vulnerable."
SYNNukAWA_o,11083,Doug Sosnik," something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you know the convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely mega Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been Trump has already taken over the RNC. So if something were to happen in a Republican convention, I don't know what they would do except I do know that the magnet forces are going to decide what happens."
_McbAySKmJo,2664,Doug Sosnik," I think it's quite different on the Democratic side. When you're, as a party coalescing behind Biden, it's largely a vote for Biden as largely organizing principle about being for Biden is the stop Trump. And as I think I've mentioned before you, it's the first person elected president since 1988, George H.W. Bush got elected for essentially a Reagan III term, which I'm sure you remember quite well. Biden is the first guy since Bush to get elected without a political base. And so his base of support, if it is one, is an anti-Trump support. So if we take these people that have coalesced as a party, and the party's more of a federation of interests, really, than it is a party that's not a narrow focus on Republicans now, it's unclear what these delegates would do at the convention, if it got to that, because of the motivation of how they're acting."
OgBsuOVeDLl,28017,Anne Applebaum,"I think back on that and think where we are now and we now have this enormous Ukrainian army, and Ukraine has links and contacts all over the world and allies all over the planet and friends inside the United States and Europe. It's an amazing achievement. Let's take a step back and think where we were and where we are. The Russians did not win. They cannot win, actually. I don't think they can win without Trump. They could not win on the battlefield. Supposedly the second- largest army in Europe has been blocked by what was supposedly what they thought and what they described as a bunch of peasants. And it's just a reminder to us all of the hubris of great powers, which has hit us at times in our history, and also the weakness of the autocratic message. The Ukrainians believe in grassroots democracy, in an open society. They have created networks of civil society who help the army and who work in defense. The army itself is, mostly at this point, a civilian army. People were doing different kinds of jobs three years ago, and yet they have put up this extraordinary defense. I mean, I think whatever happens next, the example Ukraine has set other societies for how you resist autocracy and how you stand up to violence and brutality."
Of4KIJFU9a1,27756,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
nUkI9eUmTDx,27626,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
GR8v7f5SAsp,26782,Anne Applebaum,"I don't actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all this stuff. I'm not saying he's doing this purposely and it's a brilliant four-dimensional chess thing, but it sort of conceals the true, as you say, the really sustained and pretty systematic threat to the rule of law, the institutions, the norms that he's perfectly happy to carry out and pretty conscious that he's carrying out. Right? He's pretty conscious. And a really telling thing was said to me recently by a Russian journalist I know who's now in exile, who said to me that in the Kremlin ... And this will take a minute to explain, okay? In the Kremlin, they talk about Trump as the American Gorbachev, by which they don't mean leader of the free democracy and blah. Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore."
EbMhKIczbMM,26372,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
JFKDGHlobsL,24059,Anne Applebaum,"But Ukraine has recovered from the very low point of three or so months ago when they didn't have the prospects of war aid and they were really beginning to lose ground. So I would say on the ground, that's where we are. I suppose for all these reasons, including the new uses of technology or the new technologies, it's a little unpredictable actually, if things might break in one direction or another, but I guess, am I right that the safer prediction or assumption is not huge changes in the balance of power or balance of forces on the ground over the next several months? So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian."
rEfoygkk_qF,16057,John Bolton,"Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist."
q3X1QE2pVVm,13868,John Bolton,"It's not inevitable that a defeat on a nominee hurts an incoming president. When George HW Bush nominated John Tower for defense Secretary and Tower went down, he nominated Cheney. Life moved on. For Trump, I think it's different because he's trying to portray the image of invincibility, that he won by a tremendous margin, which he didn't. He got a plurality of the votes and he won. This time, there's no dispute who won, but this is not a huge victory. This was not a landslide. And when the bubble of invincibility gets pierced, I think Trump could find himself moving very quickly from being a newly inaugurated president to the other reality, which is he's a lame duck the day he takes office. So I think good political advice would be don't fight fights you're bound to lose over somebody like Tulsi Gabbard. I mean, if you really want Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary, I don't think he'll have much opposition. You fight for that. You don't fight for the ones that are basically collateral. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly."
MOjqQdhzFsN,13831,John Bolton,"I just hope it's not as bad as it looks right now, and I hope we are able to repair it when Trump is gone. But this is purely gratuitous. It is a completely self-inflicted wound. That's really eloquent and powerful and a little chilling, honestly. I mean, I hope we can repair it also, but it's also how much damage he's done at 100 and whatever we're now at, 10 days or something, less than that, I guess. With 1,300 days or something left, I mean, one assumes that this was the shock and awe period and there's some version almost to the mean or some checking or some rethinking or some mugged-by-reality moments here where he comes back but can also spiral a little out of control, right? And that's what I guess alarms me the most. You just don't know how much strain... We're putting a lot of strain on allies and structures and arrangements that one hopes can... They've been around a long time, they can hold up some, but can they hold up throughout? That's the question, I suppose. Well, it is, and we're not acting alone here. If you're in Beijing looking at this, you're sitting around saying, ""How are we going to take advantage of what Trump is doing on Taiwan, on the South China Sea, on a range of other issues?"" And other rogue states like North Korea are thinking the same, which is why how Trump handles the Iranian nuclear weapons program could be so important."
AJzEGOZM_kt,13442,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
ntNbT9cNsvO,8705,A.B. Stoddard,"And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you're a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new liberal friends are, ""well, he can't get away with this. This lie is even worse,"" but I think they underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it... The open mic night is a great line of Mike's, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn't that bad last time. Then you say, ""Well, the reason he wasn't that bad if he wasn't was because he had 19 different constraints, both individuals and institutional constraints that won't exist in a second term,"" but no one of course is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn't stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think? I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary?"
TpyIn3eHfL3,13323,John Bolton,"Well, I think we will have crises because I think some of them are just incapable of showing good sense. Again, this fellow who's the acting US attorney in the district has been sending letters to medical journals, questioning what they're writing about the various diseases. The argument being this could be fraud or corruption of some kind. This isn't going to go very far. Trump's executive orders against the law firms where they have been challenged, where law firms haven't given in, have uniformly been struck down. And I think we'll see whether a number of the other executive orders he's trying to float don't find the same fate. Again, it looks like Trump is succeeding in a wide variety of areas. The litigation is slow to catch up because that's the way the courts operate, but I think it's justice itself that's going to find it harder and harder to do the kinds of things Trump pushed his lawyers in private practice to do. And you think the administration ultimately more or less yields to these court decisions? Well, if they don't, then we will have a constitutional crisis. There's no doubt about it. I think the courts have been pretty restrained, frankly, in the way they've approached this. There are plenty of places where you could see contempt citations being administered, but the courts are building a record because they know every time they do it, it will be appealed."
425U85hfj-e,7023,Aaron Friedberg,"That doesn't seem to have happened directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we're going to see this problem grow and take different forms, but it isn't going to go away. There will continue to be terrorism, terrorist attacks on targets in the region and outside the region, conceivably. Yuck. Meanwhile, the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years is going ahead. It's not ceased or even diminished in intensity, really. Yes. And I gather the Russians are slowly, slowly making progress. Ukraine has conducted this counteroffensive, which continues into Russian territory. But there's no sign there of any kind of decisive outcome in either direction. I guess there was hope some time ago that the Ukrainian forces might be able to roll back the Russians. And I think, for the most part, people have given up on this thought, at least for the foreseeable future. So is this headed for some kind of a stalemate? What might break the stalemate? To what extent would the United States and others support Ukraine in taking action that could conceivably have that effect, even at the risk of escalation with Russia? So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons."
cDYzqjIjszq,6314,Tim Snyder,"He doesn't pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He's kind of a link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it's ultimately about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in Ukraine, there's so much bloodshed, is clarifying. It's because that is in fact what people like. It's not just that they're tolerating it, it's what they like. Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not literally necessarily '20s, '30s European fascism, but that's something... I don't know. I had the more conventional, I was an anti-communist. And then the Cold War ended and then we had various... I was on the interventionist side, liberal interventionists, conservative interventionists side, depending on the Balkans and Middle East. But I don't know, I somehow put that out my mind. You didn't because you studied, I think, that part of the world. So that's infinitely more than I had. But I think it's a real... that's not a happy revelation, but it's one that one should've of course known all along, I guess. Yeah. It's interesting that we dropped it in the US because the whole anti..."
4m2nHMabhKU,10672,James Carville,"We had terrible disaster in Lebanon and the fall of '83 with the Marines being killed. But one got the sense... I mean, he acknowledged it and then he pivoted very quickly. And I'm not using that as an example. And Reagan, of course, everyone cites, is too much. He's too high a standard, I suppose, on a political scale, but it feels like they could be more decisive, whichever course he chooses to take. Or even if he chooses to change course. Yeah, I remember '83, the [inaudible] you know? I actually think he was too willing to move on. I think some people really screwed that up. I agree totally. Yeah. But he got beyond it. That's undeniable. But there was some... look, there's no more massive act of negligence on a part of any nation since World War II than there was about Israeli government on October 7th. That's just staggeringly... and so much of that was a result of hubris, of thinking we had everything under control, it was all done. And boy, when you look back at how arrogant they were, you could see how something like this would happen. And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have?"
qwq4q3RmpZ9,2430,Jason Furman,"This really puts the Fed in a bind. It gives them a worse set of choices than they had before. They can accept higher inflation in order to combat unemployment, or they can accept higher unemployment in order to combat inflation. Most likely they're actually going to do a combination of somewhat higher inflation and somewhat higher unemployment. And all of this is a bigger problem now because we went into this with an inflation rate of about 2.8%. And so inflation was already... hadn't come all the way back down to the landing we had wanted. That means the fear that this gets built into expectations built into the economy going forward is much more real than it might otherwise have been. And how quickly, just assume, again, oh, this policy sticks now for a couple of months at least, how quickly do we see the effects, do you think, on inflation and on unemployment or the inflationary side effects and the recessionary side effects, so to speak? Once again, unfortunately don't have enough historical experience to trace out what an economist would call the impulse response function- how the economy responds at every moment in time. My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are."
R0HjQQfSpfy,6737,Bill Galston,"It's almost hard to believe that that could be quite correct, but it is what it is, a real poll, and it ends up with Whitmer winning by 12 or 13, or something like that. And abortion, when asked, then is a big concern to a lot, especially of the Whitmer voters. And I'd be curious about thoughts on this while we're... And in the breakouts, I was talking with Ron Brownstein about this, who looked down at the cross tabs and so forth. It was penetrating, it was helping Whitmer a lot among working class white women, not just among college educated. I wonder if you think there's some potential for Democrats to ameliorate the damage that's been done to them among white working class in general, but especially women, perhaps if those women may not be so much on board. The Republican in Michigan has a pretty, I think, no exceptions stance on abortion. There are some women who are willing to accept a no exceptions stance, but not very many. That's hard turf to defend. Look, I think experience has taught both of us that a single state poll is not something you can put in the bank, but if it's confirmed by others, it will be more than suggestive. And I do think... Let me step back."
6H7nCygAbJF,5005,Steve Vladeck,"I don't know, presumably- Crimes. What? I mean, he's accused, right? He accused Representative Ocasio-Cortez of breaking the law, right? Yeah. He's accusing of breaking the law for their Congressional... for giving speeches. And so all this kind of craziness, the domestic terrorism on Tesla is kind of... One could see it being more extreme 18 months from now. A lot would depend on the courts and the Congress. I mean everything would depend I suppose, on the courts and Congress. Courts, of course, are a bit of a changing thing because Trump gets to make appointments, maybe not at the Supreme Court, depending on whether people retire but at the appellate and district court level. So I'm just curious, I mean, A, what do you think about the next, let's say this term of the court? I think that's an obvious moment to think about. And then more broadly the next year and a half in terms of sort of risks, what worries you the most? What kind of encourages you a bit, et cetera? So just one note on the courts. I mean, it's interesting Bill, that we're 50 days into the administration and we have not seen a rash of judicial retirements. Usually, when you have a political turnover, a partisan turnover, a whole bunch of judges who were waiting for the next president from their side of the aisle to be elected come right to the front the line and say, ""I'm stepping down."" We haven't seen that, which I think is an interesting data point."
YktGqiPv3z4,18272,Anne Applebaum,"I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress? And I'm the last person to put any hopes in them at this point, but half of them did vote for aide for Ukraine less than a year ago. Are they literally going to, just because Trump decides he's... Not decides. Trump has been a friend of Putin's and remains a friend of Putin's so to speak, or an ally Putin's almost. Are they simply going to give up on that? It wouldn't take that many Republicans to join the Democrats to conceivably stop Trump from doing a [aid] package, even? I guess I'm slightly more hopeful than some people that... I mean, generally presidents have a huge amount of power on foreign policy, very hard to override them when they're going at a certain direction. And sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time, it's very bad, I think. But I don't know. So for whatever it's worth my sense of if it could snowball in a very bad direction, or the opposite could happen. If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful."
UNwE8cZ6snd,6321,Tim Snyder,"That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that's very explicitly in their mind, that if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia? Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this- No, no. ...forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own... We have bubbles within a bubble, but there's one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often... I just put it very bluntly. We often just don't recognize that there's a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people and say rah-rah when there's not a vote for Ukraine aid."
bhQsIfvkU4m,17565,Anne Applebaum,"And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia? And we have analyzed this many times back and forth, and we've heard all the possible explanations, and none of them has ever really made any sense. I mean, none of it really adds up. As for Europeans, the first part of your question... So yes, Europe now-actually this has been true for a while, this has been true for more than a year-Europe in total gives more money to Ukraine than the United States does. And that's both money... Ukrainians now have their own industries. And so Europe funds a lot of the drone production, for example, inside Ukraine, or some of it takes place outside of Ukraine in neighboring countries. So, the European money, both producing weapons and giving them weapons, is now much larger than the US. Plus there's other kinds of economic support and so on. I think European, there was a kind of Czech-led project to collect ammunition from around the world, that's had an impact. And so there's no question that Europe is now the more important source of aid, military aid and economic aid for Ukraine than the United States."
g6gB7kUJ4sm,4208,David Axelrod,"He's doing stuff. I mean, the Justice Department just went after some real estate interests for price fixing on rents. The FTC just issued a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain issues from the pandemic. It turns out that they're jacking it up way beyond what their costs increases were. They're fighting these fights, but not really highlighting them to the degree I would in a campaign like this. Bottom line, be more like Joe from Scranton and less like President Biden from Washington. Put yourself on the side- because those are the voters, Bill, who are going to decide this election; working class people, Black, white, and Hispanic, who are very much scuffling still in an economy that's improved, but in which cost of living has aggregated and continues to be an obstacle. It's just so hard when you're the incumbent president and incumbent president's team to get them not to defend their record. Let's put it this way, not to have them ... They want to spend 80% of their time defending their record and explaining why they're doing better than anyone realizes, and 20% of the time talking about what they still want to do in the second term and so forth. Of course, what you're saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this- I don't even.."

But I also think people underestimated the importance of the fact that it was a five to four decision. Again, not that most voters are analyzing Supreme Court decisions super closely or whatever, but this was clear... A five four decision. Most of these big decisions are... Roe v. Wade was seven two. A little broader spectrum, you might say, of justices, and it was entirely a court... Well, there of the five were put on the court by Donald Trump in the last four years, so it was sort of not like the court has been moving in this direction for quite a while, and there were some appointees of Obama and some of Bush, who were kind of on board, and this is... You can dislike the decision, or you can say, as people do to other decisions, ""This was an overreach,"" but it would sort of have a certain kind of grudging legitimacy, you might say. Whereas here, it just... If you were already inclined to distrust the court, distrust the way some of these judges got on, distrust then, as you say, the attempt to impose this as an overturn of a 49-year-old precedent by a five four decision with three judges who were appointed in the last four years, I think that just compound..."
5AKCgbT2Oke,7208,Jack Goldsmith,"So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter. And so, again, one can be optimistic or pessimistic about what they're going to do. And I suppose whether it's one as optimistic or pessimistic is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah, Trump was amazing on just this past Sunday to ""Meet the Press."" He had, I'd say, half the time, was being pretty careful to, ""I'm not going to order anyone to do anything. It's their call."" On other issues too, mass deportations, while the Dreamers. ""Well, we try to work that out with Democrats."" And then, the other half of the time, it was, ""Well, Liz Cheney deserves to be in jail."" Right. And that, I found a little astonishing from the president elect to say about a member or former members of Congress, all the members of that committee deserve to go to prison. And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime."
F0ue4k5den8,7478,Tom Tugendhat,"It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia. And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people."
