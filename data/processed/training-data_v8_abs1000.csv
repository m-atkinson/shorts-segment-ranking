kqH4oM8uhqI,2025,Ryan Goodman," We're seeing things that I would never have imagined, masked, militarized forces on American streets, snagging people and putting it in the back of vans. And we know that at a minimum, two things, one, they're not going after hardened criminals because they're trying to meet their quotas and two, they're at a minimum making a bunch of mistakes. So we even have multiple justice department, filings in court, emitting to administrative errors of getting the wrong people and in fact sending them to like C cut prison in El Salvador and elsewhere. And that is not only the country that we're living in today, which is to me like this internal security force. I started some of my academic career and practice on human rights. I mean, that's the kind of stuff we were seeing in the Americas with when you talked about the military it was actually the internal military. And the ICE is, and not only are we seeing that, but we're on the cusp of tens of billions of dollars being infused into ICE right at the moment that this is all happening, just to ramp up that force. And once you do that, I'm not quite sure why you need the Marines because they seem so pumped up in a very militaristic way and both in their fatigues and their heavy arms and including in instances in which they're going to a home depot or whatnot to arrest just very ordinary people."
LheEa0iNiI0,1232,Ryan Goodman," the unitary executive, the idea that the president controls vertically everything within the executive branch and therefore the court is going to in all likelihood they've already signaled this through their decisions, give the president the power to remove people from multi-member independent agencies at will whenever he wants to without cause. That's one building block that they've been building for a long time now. And then I guess the other one is the Casa Decision, which is just a few days old while we're talking and that's the decision that says that court should not intrude on the executive branch through issuing nationwide or universal injunctions. And my view of that one is it's not trying to hand something to Trump. It's just the way that they were going to go. At some point they were going to go in that direction they've been signaling it for years and it's one of the cases in which I thought if you actually get down deep into the case surely to goodness, even if that's what they want. And there's reasonable minds definitely can come out with the idea that nationwide injunctions are bad. They could have also said, well in this particular instance of birthright citizenship we're going to still find against the Trump administration. There are a couple ways they could have easily done that and they didn't do it. And so I think Trump is supercharged after that opinion. That's where I think it's like not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House."
P9ylrEMLAOA,3110,Ray Takeyh," It has paid a huge price for his great power allies, China and Russia. It sells oil at discount to the Chinese. The Chinese are very exploitative in their relationship with Iran, and that doesn't sit well with Iranian people, because they're limited to Chinese products which they don't like, and they're selling their oil at the discount rate to the Chinese multinationals. And in terms of the Russian Federation, Iran was involved in a war in Central Europe, for which it had no particular interest at stake, ideological or practical. What happened to those great power allies that were supposed to come together? What happened to this access that was supposed to be so regenerating? And the Russians have offered to mediate. The Chinese have issued the ritualistic statement by their foreign ministry saying that conflict should stop and cooler history prevail. So that's another alliance that Iran had invested a great deal in. It saw itself as part of this new anti-American access. They came to the Russians aid. They shipped a lot of drone technology to China, which they could have used today. And the Russians all they did was offer to mediate this dispute and call for comms. So that's another angle that hasn't worked out for the regime at such."
Lzq5409v0zw,5340,Ray Takeyh," In the past two or three years, Israelis have turned all the assumptions on their head. In the past three years, Israelis have essentially proven that force and power can work. In the past years, Israelis have proven that everything you taught in your American university about the release is not true. Once they demolish his Bola, it made this attack possible. I do think, frankly, Israelis are probably surprised at their own tactical success, because I think all of us Israelis included had discounted, had deep deraught wars in the Islamic Republic, had institutions had decayed so much. So, yes, it would not have happened, I think, without the Israeli daring attacking against his Bola."
SgcLmozMpY8,3979,Eric Edelman," Susan Glasser of the New Yorker captured it very well in her letter from Washington this week in which she said, the trip that demonstrated that Trump really has no particular foreign policy doctrine. I mean, he was very critical of the Gulf Petro state monarchies that he traveled to in 2016 when he was running president. He criticized Hillary Clinton for taking money from some of these states, including Qatar. He obviously has no problem with it now, including this gift. But as Susan Glasser wrote, it's the perfect symbol for the trip because he has no doctrine. He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this cuttery, you know, luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trump as a material the substance of Trump."
tI85IxhxDSY,2028,Eric Edelman," Now in the meeting with El Shara, the president did ask for some of the things we would want from a new Syria, or instance normalization. With Israel, have Syria join the Abraham Accords and become another neighbor of Israel it has made peace with it. It would be like Egypt and Jordan and the UAE, Bahrain, other states surrounding Israel in the region. That would be a good thing. He asked for El Shara to expel some of the foreign jihadis who helped El Shara come to power, but who have since been engaged in intercommunal violence in Syria that has troubled observers who would like to see a stable Syria. He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias that with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations to reintegrate them into the Syrian armed forces and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who if left untended could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria. He asked for all of those very important things."
QScoIOT1QRA,5022,John Bolton," What Trump has done when you add all this together, when you add in his policies on Ukraine, when you look at the things he said about NATO and our alliance structures, and the things he said about making Canada the 51st state, the way he's completely messed up the whole Greenland issue, which is of importance to American national security, threatening to invade Panama, saying he was gonna take the Gaza Strip and turn it into the Riviera, the Mediterranean. He is burning through decades of effort to build up goodwill, trust, faith, reliance on America. Our friends all over the world are saying, you've taken leave of your senses. I think some have overreacted, and I think that's a mistake. It's Trump that's the problem. It's not the American people. Much of what Trump is doing, they didn't vote for in November and they don't like now. We'll get through Trump. There is a life after Trump. We will then try and repair the damage he's done. People shouldn't overreact to this, but in the tariffs and all these many other things, it's not just the economic consequences for the US. It's the loss of what makes America exceptional. Again, very few people have talked about this. Ken Griffin has stood up and said, Trump is damaging brand USA. That's how a business guy would think about it, and it's an aspect of it. But it's just the faith in us as a country that we've accumulated since 1945. You can just see it disappearing in front of your eyes."
5gvHhCPUxK8,10148,John Bolton," As Vladimir Putin has shown, he's still a master manipulator of Trump. Xi Jinping hasn't made his play yet, but we may not be far from seeing that given the potential for a tariff war between the US and China. And there are a lot of other players out there that are seeing this chaos, and they see chaos in the four of the administration too. They know that affects decision-making and increases the chance that they will do something they think we may not even notice let alone respond to."
TR_XSOHfW7c,16880,John Bolton," I think Hague Seth's performance has been so far below expectations that despite some initial moves like removing the chairman of the joint chiefs and taking pictures off the walls and things like that, or former secretaries and defense, which is just silly, and I think regarded as silly. There hasn't been as much disruption as there might have been. Now there are things that are coming that are not good. I don't think the military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, which coincidentally is the anniversary of the formation of the army is a good idea. It didn't happen in the first term, although Trump talked about it a lot, and I think that was a good thing for the country. It will not be a good thing to have this parade. And there are people in the defense department in policy-making positions in civilian ranks who are as bad as JD Vance and Tulsi Gabbard on a lot of our national security issues."
ANlH4VHJXYI,6645,Larry Summers, nearly a month since Liberation Day is that there is no evidence zero of markets accommodating themselves to these policies. All the good news when there has been good news has come from a sense that there's going to be a policy reversal. None of it has come from a sense that well we really are going to impose the tariffs. There really is going to be some kind of American Renaissance. Zero of it has that character. All of it is well maybe they won't go through with this crazy stuff. Maybe they'll back off here. Look they backdoor there. Look they're sending signals that they're just going to declare victory and not do anything real. So that is the disturbing thing.
lOjcEGL4Oqo,5453,Jason Furman," The conceptual error is that every time the United States has a trade deficit with a country, that is evidence that the other country is doing something wrong and hurting us and taking advantage of us. That is the core idea here and the core thing the president is trying to solve. I don't think he'll solve it by the way. And just to give an example of this, take Madagascar. We run a trade deficit with Madagascar right now. They sell us vanilla beans. They don't buy very much from us, mostly because they're really poor. We're not going to make America great again by selling more to Madagascar. We've now put a huge tariff on Madagascar. What will that mean? Probably won't mean that they buy more of our stuff and make America rich. It means we're going to buy less vanilla beans and have less of that in our country. And so a lot of these trade patterns just have to do with what country has what? What country is able to do what? What country has comparative vantage, resource endowment, and instead Donald Trump thinks it's unfair and we can make ourselves rich by doing something about it. Everyone makes different things. Everyone buys and sells different things. Now, there's the aggregate trade deficit. You could argue that that's too high, but that's too high, mostly because we're borrowing too much from the rest of the world. And the main thing driving that borrowing is our budget deficit. So if you wanted to worry about the overall trade deficit, you actually want to look to underlying macroeconomic drivers. But that, of course, is the opposite of what they're doing."
SC7Uug1Wq8I,2715,Jason Furman," I don't think it's the end of days or Armageddon, but that's not to say that our Turkey is a good idea. You know, not starving to death is a pretty low bar. You know, not having Armageddon is a pretty low bar. So what we're talking about here is, you know, some meaningful short run pain. If you're in the markets, that might be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars lost. If it's just your income and purchasing power, I'm you're talking about a couple thousand dollars lost. Then it's not just short term pain, long term, there's also more pain. This might be just a couple tenths off of our economic growth rate per year because we have less globalization. Well, a couple tenths really accumulates over time. I mean, the way I think about it is the United States and Argentina were quite similar in the year 1900. They're very different now. Why? Because the United States grew 0.7% percentage point per year faster than Argentina, year in and year out. And so if this moves us sort of one-third of the way to Argentina, that wouldn't be a good thing."
qYn8_N1yDZI,9807,A.B. Stoddard," I do find among my friends and peers and family people who are not following this closely, they believe that there's like this 100-day sprint and then it will end and that I think that they believe there's some guardrails that are going to magically appear like airbags in a car accident. And 2ZWiles, the Chief of Staff, will have a conversation with a very high ranking person of the CIA and all this nonsense will be stopped. That's not what happens. It accelerates and it grows because the more power you give and the more it'll take and the less pushback he gets, the freer he is. And so I think what we've seen in the last couple of months is that he's been given permission and he will take it. That's where Trump is. And he believes his pathologies create a story for him that this is what the people want. Now they adore everything he does."
CUHJXnlKohI,4951,A.B. Stoddard," This talk of the third term, and whether or not your vote is going to count, I think, alongside to kitchen table issues is absolutely essential to try to educate the public on what's coming. The Trump in the end intends to control the rule of law, the courts, you know, everything, but he wants to control elections and he wants to find a way to a third term. I don't care for publicans and say, of course he's saying that he doesn't want to be in lame ducks, so he doesn't really need it. And the 22nd Amendment, no, Democrats have to push this into the debate. Okay, Republican, Congressman, or Senator, are you really opposed to him running a third time? Do you want him when he's 82 to run again when you said Biden couldn't? Where are you? We need you on the record. What will you do to stop it? I'm with Liz Cheney. He never intends to leave. He intends to die there. That's my belief. You'll have other guests on this show that disagree and you don't have to agree with me. That's my 100% opinion. I don't waver on that."
FrdJxgUjpcA,2519,Steve Vladeck," This is not business as usual and it's not close to business as usual. And if you look for business as usual, you'd have real trouble finding business as usual. The overarching problem is not any one particular thing that Trump and the executive branch have done over the last 50 days. It's all of it. It's the aggregation. We've seen individual flashpoints for some of these legal controversies before Bill. We've seen presidents claim the power to not spend at least certain money Congress has appropriated, we've seen firings that have been controversial, if not unlawful. But we've never seen it at this scale and we've never seen such a wholesale attempt on the part of a president, basically to clear out and hollow out the executive branch. We've never seen, I think, such a wholesale effort to install loyalists in all of the relevant positions of government. Not to sort of put this all on the executive branch, we've never seen Congress, I think so completely abandoned its own institutional interest, even though we may have been sliding toward that for years."
4jTP4hKE0pY,8075,Steve Vladeck," No matter how things go from here, even on the optimistic account, we're going to look back at this period with a lot of regret and a lot of woe. But, right, the critical point, and I think this is a point that is underscored by history, is the time to sort of lay down the marker and stand up, is earlier rather than the later. You fight the war not when it's best for you to fight it. You fight the war when you can minimize the damage. Minimizing the damage isn't going to make everybody whole, but we should be all invested in minimizing the damage at this point, as opposed to any scenario where Trump has given more of an opportunity to make it worse."
yiG4oMsgULM,16199,Anne Applebaum," In terms of whether the Europeans can help Ukraine, and the answer is yes, their help has been really key so far. Missing peace is that Europeans are part of NATO and the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO is an American. So all of the decision-making processes all run through the United States, the assumption that the US would lead has been part of the NATO structure. Rethinking that structure or rethinking how Europe could act together differently outside of that structure is not something you can do in five minutes. I mean, there is something like a coalition of the willing emerging, and it certainly includes Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Poland, now Germany, UK, France, maybe Italy, maybe Spain, they're a little farther away from the war and they don't feel it is sharply. There's clearly a group of countries who feel directly that Russia is a threat to them, economically, as I said, in cyber, in sabotage in many other ways, and you'll see them working together. They will be making heavy defense investments. I mean, the big argument in Germany is gonna be how much money can we finally borrow money? Germans have weird rules about debt. You're not allowed to have debt in Germany. Maybe it attempt to create a defense bank. I mean, basically, they need a lot more defense spending right now."
0Z3btxMQjGc,16043,Anne Applebaum," This is not a conservative movement. This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are skeptical of science. They are skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. There's a quality of difference. You see online, people saying, oh well, you know, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement. No, this is not. This is a break from the conservative movement. It's a break from 80 years of foreign policy. It's a break from more than 100 years of having an independent civil servant."
GaY7PuSd8jg,1292,Renée DiResta," Elon Musk, when he bought Twitter, significantly changed how content was weighted in the feed. Blue checks, all of a sudden were for sale, and their content would be ranked higher, their replies would be ranked higher. People could monetize influencers who wanted to make money, wanted to be more sensational, and then the algorithm would curate that because people would engage with it. And so you would see a very different style, like your feed, when people say my feed on X is totally different now, that's because the incentives are different, and the way that it's ranked is different. And the person who controls that is X, which is now owned by one person. So what's the alternative? It's to move to platforms where you have better control over your own feed. Blue Sky is really the only thing that's doing that. It's new. I think it's still kind of red as like, live Twitter because of the sort of early adopters. I think threads is starting to get at, again, this like here are different ways that you can view your feed. Maybe other platforms will start to move into that mode."
S31giVAfZpk,881,Renée DiResta," I had an anti-vaccine account so I could follow anti-vaccine news without it polluting my main feed. A mad account would get recommended flat-earth content. It would get recommended chemtrails content. And then I would join the flat-earth and the chemtrails groups. And this account never posted. It just joined. After the chemtrails, I started getting pizza gate, right? This was around the election around 2015, 2016 timeframe. The Hillary Clinton emails and all that stuff. And so I wind up with pizza gate. I locked back in thing I wanted to get some screenshots related to some chemtrails stuff that I was paying attention to. I wound up seeing QAnon content. And this was before QAnon was really in the news. It's this progression. So if you like one conspiracy, the algorithm thinks you'll like other conspiracies. Exactly. QAnon wouldn't have existed to the extent that it does today without the recommendation engines pushing all of those people into those groups. There were many of them by that point because the algorithms were bringing them together. Well, conspiracy theorists will talk all day long because they're in there digesting the Q-drop figure out where the pedophiles are, where the children are, whatever."
2qJcH4Sh35A,5810,Ryan Goodman," from a legal perspective, the most important element is the executive authority that the Trump administration is claiming. And what I mean by that is what constitutional power are they asserting behind all of these executive orders that is different in character than anything that's proceeded at including the first Trump administration? We had a piece published at Jess Security. I thought it was one of the most important pieces we published since January 20th, which is by the former dean of NYU Law Trevor Morrison and Adam Cox, two of the most level-headed legal scholars. And their entire piece is actually looking at these executive orders across the board and then saying, actually, there's an assertion here of what they call a quote unquote dictatorial theory of executive authority, meaning that the Trump team is claiming that just as president, he can completely override congressional statute. The first branch of government doesn't matter."
1wb8pTEGTD8,2080,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick," when you look at the National Guard, which is many of them proposed, National Guard troops don't wanna do this. I think it's pretty easy to say you don't join the National Guard because you wanna go around rounding up grandmas. That is a major challenge for the United States if they go down that path of trying to co-opt the military for this. You know, National Guard recruiting is already difficult. Military recruiting is down significantly. Military recruiting is in many ways the highest among immigrant communities. And there are very high numbers of people with green cards and others coming from, you know, immigrant backgrounds joining the military by comparison to people who've been here for a few generations. So if they actually start using the military to go into immigrant communities, you could be ordering a National Guard troop to go arrest their own family member. I mean, I don't think that's particularly likely scenario, but it's the kind of thing that would, you know, hurt the US, I think a lot more than people are really thinking about."
YjaPyQIshwc,8924,John Bolton," President got elected, he runs the executive branch. You might or might not like some policy, a subordinate or a cabinet member is advocated, but if the president advocated, he's entitled to a person who agrees with him in the position. The role of the Senate, and I think is envisioned by the framers, was to look at competence and moral fitness for the job, where a lot of these nominees had trouble. Part, this was Trump induced because his people were saying, he's totally in charge, he's invincible, he's gonna get whatever he wants, these 53 Republican senators, just a bunch of wicks, spittles, and they'll acquiesce very quickly, and then they did so difference between, at the high bar of expectations, what happens was pretty dramatic. That's why I think a gathered in particular is vulnerable, and that may bring some people back down to earth, and he'll get better advice on the politics of navigating the Senate than he's gotten so far."
7B8svXBm8CY,23073,John Bolton," He does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy. He thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc, transactional, episodic, inconsistent, and there's been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, well, he's gotten worse over time. He got worse during the first four years. He got worse during the intervening four years. I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term. He now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. His focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good. That's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years, because that's always got."
OjJ-m5icwIg,4049,Ron Brownstein," I take it as performancely will influence both. Even the most spirited campaign couldn't overcome a negative verdict on Biden's performance. If Trump is a success, Republicans will be in a very strong position in 2028. If in fact he goes ahead with massive tariffs and mass deportation that cause inflation to spike again, and if he pursues a series of these policies that people continue to express reservations about, but kind of hope wouldn't happen. Or, you know, the cultural gains among Latino men are probably real. The decline was so uniform. Says to me that it was bigger than anything targeted at any one group, right? It was essentially a shared national verdict on the past four years. If that's the cause, if that's the driving factor, then the shared national verdict on the next four years is gonna be the most important factor in 2028."
YgCjoJWg1Ak,5274,Ron Brownstein," The magnitude of it was startling. Everyone expected in states that weren't being fought. Trump would improve whether they were blue states or red states because you can't have 75% wrong track, 60% disapproval of the president and not have an erosion of his party's position. But the idea that you could hive off or put the swing states under a dome and in those states you could counteract the underlying trend by spending money to focus people on what they didn't like about Trump. That worked in 2022. It worked to a slight extent in 2024, but not nearly to the extent they needed. And essentially we saw a nationwide uniform verdict. Voters were dissatisfied with what they got over the past four years. And whatever doubts they had about the alternative, that seemed to them less risky than continuing on the course that we are on. As we have seen in elections like Carter, HW Bush stability is risk."
ztqRX-WTHQg,3136,Ron Brownstein," Harris is winning the campaign, the candidate war, and the campaign, better campaign. Trump's winning the paid media or the other judge. Like the week before the first debate, a Republican strategist said to me, if we win this election, it won't be because of the interactions between Trump and Harris, either at the debates or in the day-to-day driving of the news cycles. If we win the election, it will be because we basically run the campaign against her that we've run against Democrats for Senator and Governor forever in these swing states, basically portraying them as an extreme cultural liberal who are soft on prime immigration and won't keep you safe. It's basically like whatever craziness is happening around Trump. You know what he's talking about? You know, Arnold Palmer's junk or animal lector, whatever is happening with Trump himself. That campaign, that ad campaign is like motoring forwards. It's the terminator."
dnMGLuU29LM,1799,Ron Brownstein," The exception of John Kerry in 2004, Democrats in this century have won women voters by somewhere between 11 to 13 points, pretty consistently Biden pushed that up a little higher, maybe to 15 points. Harris might push it up a little more than that, and it is possible that Trump will run a little better with men than he did last time because you are seeing improvements certainly among Latino men. He is gonna run better with Latino men than he did last time. Maybe a little bit better with black men and probably somewhat better among young white men. You know, younger white men that he's put a lot of effort into courting, I would not be surprised if Harris wins women by more than Biden did and loses men by more than Biden did."
a4Lm5LW4Rfk,1960,Jason Furman," We're in a place in the United States right now where if all we had was our native born workforce, we would have shrinking employment. Every month you would wake up and you would get the jobs number and it would be a negative number. I mean, that wouldn't even be because you're in recession. That would just be because some people were getting older and retiring and the fertility rate is below two. So you're below the replacement rate you need. So the only reason that we're not Japan that we have a growing workforce is because of immigrants. I don't think it's great that we've created an economic system that basically can't function without undocumented immigrants. I would much rather that we have a lawful system that expands legal immigration. As part of that expansion, you could weight it more heavily towards a point type system based on on skill-based immigration, but I think there's a lot of room for a lot of different types. And then at the same time, you can tighten up the border. It's not something Harris seems to want to go near. And then Donald Trump, he wants to expel a lot of people in this country, which I think would be inhumane."
5YfICpVlFKE,18546,James Carville," What I think she has license to do is I think the point is whatever we consider it's a base will allow her greatly way in appealing to more online voters. And that's that it in Trump doesn't have in abortion. He's caught. He doesn't have very much strategic space at all. Because if he goes one way, the pro-life people get furious, he goes another way in the people that he needs to supplement his base get furious. He sees he's caught in a pretty, pretty bad place there. And I can't think of an issue where she doesn't have space to operate."
QIa9noVgK1E,10998,James Carville," actually think that the demographic that may have the most elasticity in this cycle might be white college nails. A, that they are tended to be much more pro-choice than non-college white males. B, they're probably doing because of the markets and other stuff of them. I don't have figured in front of them, but I'm pretty safe in saying that more college white males and stock market than other demographics. And then we are the least fashionable demographic in America. But you could listen to NPR for two weeks and not even know that we exist. All right, but I do think there's some elasticity and upward movement for her among college white males."
p4Xj_pNilJI,2864,Doug Sosnik," There are seven states that are considered the most competitive. She's clearly much more competitive in the Sunbelt States. There's were all kind of loss for Biden by the time the debate was happening, certainly after the debate. And these are safe, disproportionately younger voters and non-wife voters. And those are the groups that left Biden compared to how they voted in 2020. She's largely gotten most of those back. The question is, oh, in those states, is she able now to make them much more competitive, but fall short? And then you go to the Midwestern states, where there's some evidence that she's running behind the Biden was with these nine-college whites. She could end up in the worst of both worlds, where she does well enough in the Sunbelt to make it really close, but not win. And then in the West Belt States, the margins work against her."
q_pTEUy6o7g,1079,Doug Sosnik," Harris is currently winning the fight to define what this campaign is about. So far, she is winning the battle about the campaign being about change and as she is the change candidate and making the campaign about the future and not about the past. I think she's also done an excellent job of defining who she is on her terms. Prior to the convention, I think there was a stellar rollout and I think the convention was was hitting on all the points that she was attempting to make before it. And so I think while not complete, she's off to a very good start and the polling reflects the significant uptick and favorable views towards Harris although it's not solidified."
1_m2f9kJkhw,13161,James Carville," something is going on at Marlago. I'm not sure what it is, you know, that was that Black journalist thing. You know, some people actually think that was planned. If it disguised Las Sivitas, Susie Walsh, they're not stupid. I mean, if one elections before, all right? And what's coming out of there? They don't know where to go. They let it get away from them. I mean, if you and I were running that campaign, we looked at, I'd say, Bill, but there are three things can happen. Biden dropped out its Harris. Biden drops out its open thing, but you would have a plan that you would pull off the shelf. From what little bit I can read, they were just standing there feeling good about themselves and then they got hit in the mouth and then there was no concerted, organized, thought out reaction, which is pretty amazing."
DuuilC1-e00,9287,James Carville," parts of the Democratic Party, not Joe Biden, not Democratic primary voters, lost their minds. And everybody thought this was the wave of the future. The identity politics had been essential to any discussion of politics. And of course, it was a giant mistake. She bought into that. And you know, to a guy like me, you could see this coming. So I went back and looked in April 27th, 2021. I did an interview on box and I said, this stuff is killing us. This is the dumbest thing that you can imagine. And I, you know, I'll give myself credit. I was right. You know, I called defund the police to three stupidest words in the history of English language. And of course, no one's talking about it now."
pwbii06y9hg,3370,Doug Sosnik," Let's say Trump wins. If you said to me, when was the defining moment in this election? I would say was in the summer of 2021. Trump, never for a day had a job approval of over 50 percent. Biden had job approval from the mid to high fifties from January 20th taking office until beginning of July 2021. There was a confluence of events that really sort of defined the Biden presidency politically. Substitutely, I think he's going to be in great shape 40 years from now. People look back at what he accomplished, but we're talking about the politics of getting reelected. Starting with the 4th of July, where essentially Biden declared victory over COVID and told the country we'd be back to normal Labor Day. August, you had the withdrawal of Afghanistan. September was the first month that we had over 6 percent inflation. And then at the end of September, early October was the beginning of supply chain problems. I went under water in those 90 days and essentially never recovered."
L3nMbqv3Aao,1232,Doug Sosnik," She's got to consolidate the base first. She's got to pull together the parties and reassure people that she's up to the task. To me, if I'm looking at this from the Harris standpoint, I want to create a really positive first impression for the country, because most people don't know her, and also for kind of lapsed Democrats. But I view the target here is to neutralize the inherent advantages Trump has in the short term. It works as quickly as possible to secure the de facto nomination. I want to be out there as fast as I can to try to define her. But the tipping point for me about how to win this election is how the party leaves Chicago at the end of the convention. And leaves Chicago as sort of a normal candidate who's been running for president for a while, which I think is doable, but damn hard, that to me would be the goal of our running the Harris operation."
eqrdSzSM3zs,1338,John DiIulio," What was it called with my guy? We said that wars the continuation of politics by other means they see administration public administration as the continuation of politics by other means. And for 46 years now, the civil service reform act of 78, that's been the battleground. That's been, you know, the ground zero in partisan and ideological battles over the extent to which the president can and should control the federal bureaucracy and its workforce and the concomitant battle over unionization public employee unionization. Schedule F, however, is not just the latest salvo in this battle. It is really the first use of nuclear, rather than conventional weapons. I can go through and talk about what I think it purports to accomplish, how it purports to accomplishment and accomplish it and why the key underlying understanding or the background facts really don't support it."
o_-ANM_9k2A,5422,James Carville," The age issue is going to be huge. All right, and up to it out there. Nancy Pelosi, Stenyoria, Jim Clyburn, Al Ruzzi, and Epoch. All of them are younger than Biden would be at the end of the second term. As of this moment, there's 33 million, 361,000, four-hundred and eleven people that live in the United States. Could we please find somebody under 75 to be our president, Harris? She should obviously be a top-tier candidate, As Wood Gavin Newsom, you know, Jay-Enzli, Jared Pugas, Amy Klogechar. I'll give you one that I would look at real close, JB Prescott. All right, Gretchen Whitman, not Big Gretchen. I mean, probably the most successful Democratic state anywhere in the country. I mean, she has a hell of a story to tell."
lr_87GS9KjE,6972,Anne Applebaum," Part of the difficulty is that it's not like there are these two geographic blocks, you know, and there's a Berlin wall that divides them. In fact, there are different actors on both sides, and we have autocratic actors inside the United States, and there are democratic actors inside Russia. And you have to think of it more. It's not a cold war. I actually very much dislike this cold war 2.0 language. You know, it's not about just lining up all our ducks on one side and shooting at the other side. It's not going to be like that. A lot of fighting the war is going to be about internal reform, making our system more resilient, and doing so together with other allies in Europe and Asia, and even working with democratic movements in other places in Russia, in Iran, in China, and so on. And so beginning to think like that, and I think we're still really just at the beginning."
SDP3hr8dIvs,1647,Jason Furman," The one place that former President Trump has been completely explicit is on tariffs. He's spelled out exactly what he do, which is 10% tariffs on every single country in the world and every single thing that we buy from them. So what would this do? It would raise consumer prices, which would obviously show up as inflation. It would lead to reactions. There's not like other countries are going to sit there standing still and just let us put tariffs on. They're going to put tariffs on us. The net effect on things like American manufacturing are completely ambiguous and could easily be negative for a number of different reasons. You raise the price of steel and it makes it harder to make cars. The tariffs that we get on our exports will hurt American manufacturing. And overall, you look at the totality of his policies and for a variety of reasons, they would probably strengthen the dollar, which will make it harder for exports. And for manufacturing."
AWCVLqL63es,1056,Jason Furman," I just came back from a meeting with economic policy makers and economists in Europe, and they are just to a person incredibly jealous of the United States. They would love to have our short-term economic recovery. They'd love to have our longer-term productivity. They'd love to have our stock market. They would love to have our technology companies. We are just, we really, really are right now economically the envy of the world. I think it makes a lot of sense that we worry about our problems and figure out what we can do to make it even better. I don't think when voters go to the ballot box telling them you're in better shape than Germany means a whole lot, but we should be able to at least step back and say, well, we talk about all these problems and all these worries. The big picture is a really quite extraordinary American economy."
9gDYRFhwU-0,15137,Anne Applebaum," Instead of one war, there are now three wars. There is the Land War, which is the thing you read about the most. And in the Land War, Ukraine is very much still on the defensive. There is a second war, which is taking place in the Black Sea. And this is mostly Ukrainians using long-range missiles drones to attack Crimea and targets in and around Crimea. And then there's a third thing happening, which is very hard to understand, because we don't really have any good reporting on it. And this is almost like a long-range duel. So there's the Russians trying to hit Ukrainian power plants, Ukrainian infrastructure, and basically the Ukrainians trying to hit Russian infrastructure, and especially Russian oil refining capacity. So it's almost like there are these three spheres of the war, and Ukraine is doing not so well in the first, much better in the second, and the third is a kind of ongoing duel."
lCzRJPSRKeE,11455,Anne Applebaum," The interesting thing is we're talking about countries that do not share ideology. So communist China, nationalist Russia, theocratic Iran, but they do share a common interest and the common interest is undermining us and us, I mean America, Europe, the liberal world, the democratic world, because both because their own oppositions are inspired by and use democratic language and because chaos and uncertainty offer them business opportunities in the western world and increasingly they've concluded that what benefits them is the rise of illiberal and radical parties. When that happens, the western world or the democratic world loses its sense of community and solidarity, it loses its ability to make group decisions."
aznRJaopeKeE,6113,James Carville," the president's campaign, I think the economic messages, things are better than you think they are, which if left alone, maybe some consumer confidence numbers might look a little bit better, but you got to let people come to that conclusion, because if you come to the conclusion for them, and they don't think it's a good economy, they said, well, how can this guy fix something that he doesn't even think it's broke? There's no no message in that says, you're going to be happy with what you're going to see. He could say, we have unfinished work, I have a record to build on, not to sit on, but we've created a foundation by chips and new green energy projects and you know, they create anything like that, but have the some future conclusion that it's all going to get, it's all going to get better."
SSd86JwBTRc,2895,James Carville," They should run against MAGA and not Trump. MAGA is less popular than Trump. And what I would think that Biden's gonna say is you've been overtaken by this MAGA movement. We need a lot of people who voted for Trump. They're just not all of them are MAGA. And if we can drive a stake between MAGA and them, and them, we could get some of some could stay home because they're not comfortable with it. I think that's a potential to tie him to the movement because the movement is called NBC Poe is a 24% approved piece, 42. I think you have an opportunity there, but you gotta take opportunities at every point. And I think there's only so much Biden can do."
GNGzXKl-MzQ,20937,James Carville," The Democratic problem is, I don't see how we can replicate the 2020 coalition. In other words, 70 out of 100 people who voted in 2020 will under 30 and up that President Biden got 62%. Black was 12% share. So, about every 100 people had voted black, Biden got 90%. I don't think you're going to hit those numbers this year so you have to make it up somewhere else. Now, the good news is we do seem to be doing somewhat better with older whites, which is good because they vote, you know, higher than other people."
eihcQa6TUL0,19090,James Carville," The question it can it have an effect? The answer is yes. If he's acquitted or even to hang a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much don't know an acquittal would be very good for him, but if there's a guilty burden, that matters to people. And so people say well the hardcore Trump pickback probably not gonna affect the hardcore, but as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just Maga. And so a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat, they're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote."
_t6LDeGM6dE,10934,Robert Kagan," This is where Donald Trump, I think, is important. There were certainly other anti-liberal candidates available. But Trump is the one who has been able to capture this force because I think of his own peculiar personality. This guy introduced himself to the American public as a presidential candidate in 2011, as a white supremacist. And when he comes out on the birth of conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. They see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the liberal, the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America. That he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large."
27e77KuatmA,4865,Robert Kagan," Accepted in the 1920s, I think that the anti-liberal forces basically won and they did control the President's seat. And the 1924 Immigration Act is the most restrictive immigration act in American history and it very specifically not only focuses on only allowing white people in but only a certain kind. And so, you know, we've completely forgotten about this period, but it's an example of the fact that you can go backwards. And what undid that sort of triumph of white anti-liberalism were events. The Depression discredited the Republican and conservative movement followed by World War II, which discredited racism and really led to a huge flowering of liberalism in the wake of what had been a very dominant anti-liberal 1920s."
jtuWU_md-rE,2137,Frederick W. Kagan," The later we get into the year, the more possible it is to think about Ukrainians conducting counterattacks into stalling Russian offensive operations and starting to regain a little bit of of the initiative on the battlefield. There's a lot of variables there. militarily in terms of how a military operations work, it's very plausible. So it's, you know, so option number one is that we get into the fall, into the early fall and the Ukrainians actually are able to begin conducting some limited counterattacks, maybe very small counteroffenses to take advantage of failing Russian attacks. That would be optimistic. I can see other scenarios, possibly more realistic in which the Ukrainians focus on a spring counteroffensive. As bad as things look at the moment, it's still very conceivable to see how the Ukrainians could launch a counteroffensive and begin to take back territory, either, you know, late this year or into next year."
Mes-7RcVqWI,3663,Frederick W. Kagan," Odds are sometime in mid-delayed May, June. We'll see the start of another major Russian offensive operation. And the Ukrainians will have to weather that. The Russians are building a group of forces in the Algarod oblast, which is the Russian area directly north of Harki. And Ukrainians are talking about Russians preparing to drive on Harki city again, which they have not done since 2022. I personally skeptical that the Russians are going to be able to put together a large enough force really to threaten to take the city against equipped Ukrainian defenders. But that will draw Ukrainian forces away from other parts of the front and make defending against the whole thing challenging. Really pretty confident the Ukrainians are not going to lose the Harki or any major city and the front is not going to collapse. And we'll see what kind of ground and troops they lose."
B1fMutEVtGw,10545,Mark Esper," I think you have to take President Trump and any leader for that matter at their word. And Trump has been explicit with regard to what he would do. You know, with Ukraine, he said he cut off funding, cut off support. But he's also attacked NATO. Said it's not a good deal for the United States. I think he would pursue those things in the second term because he's unbound by the need to kind of play to a re-election. And so then the other big question becomes, who does he put in his cabinet? You know, myself and Mike Pompeo and John Bolton would talk him out of these things. Or times when it came to funding Ukraine trying to talk him into providing funding for Ukraine. So you know, keep part here is one him, but the opposite side of the coin or who are the people he brings around him, those are unknowns that we should be concerned about as this election unfolds."
wGWMGl_iP5I,3972,Defense Secretary," And as the election denialism continued, there was a growing concern that would the military get involved. And we all know now that there was a meeting in late December with Mike Flynn and others who said, yeah, maybe we should send the military to seize ballot boxes or to conduct another election. I can't recall the details, but it was quite alarming that the military would be putting that context. I was concerned going into the fall that the military would be used at the time of the election when the results were revealed to put down protests, to do other things. And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did. I mean, in my lifetime, if you had told me five, 10, 15, 20 years ago that there would be an insurrection on Capitol Hill and people would storm the Capitol and try and seize ballot boxes and threaten to hang Mike Pence the vice president, it would be like a bad Hollywood movie, right? But it was real and it should be a wake up call for all of us."
kTCmIXYLMBc,3218,Defense Secretary," I think one of the things that the Trump administration did well was approved providing javelins, for example, javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine. That came in very effective when the Russians invaded a few years later. But beyond that, we did a lot of training trying to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards. We had US forces, NATO forces there. I actually went to the city of Laviv in Western Ukraine where we were training them, spent a couple of days on the ground, talking to Ukrainians, talking to our people. So it was a great effort. And I believe as much as the weapons, training the Ukrainians to NATO standards, NATO tactics and techniques, when they would eventually go against a Russian army still using Soviet block tactics really made a big difference in the initial days of the war."
QkbrjeIS77g,4111,David Axelrod," You need to make this a very comparative campaign. You cannot allow this to be a referendum in an environment in which 65% of the country feels like things are on the wrong track. People need to understand this is a choice now. It's not a choice between him and the Almighty, it's him and the alternative, and the alternative is deeply, deeply flawed. I mean, Donald Trump is consumed by his past. His program for the future, he'd like people to feel that it's about the economy and immigration, but it's really about retribution and revenge. He has no sense of empathy. He views everything through the prism of Donald Trump. And that should be a real advantage for Joe Biden."
LDZr-3aFgb0,2754,David Axelrod," I suspect that if you're sitting around the kitchen table talking about the future of democracy, you're not worried about the cost of the food you're eating. You're not worried about your rent and your gas. I think ultimately the voters who care deeply about democracy and about Trump's sundering of it are going to vote for Joe Biden. I think that the real challenge for the Biden campaign is to reach people for whom that might not be the primary concern for whom I think principally economic issues are the concern, but also they have concerns about personal safety and many have concerns about the viability of their children's future and a lot of young people who are dissolution, you know, we talk about abortion rights, which is a motivator for young people."
A8b61KgROGs,6051,James Carville," How worried are you about? You mentioned to fund the police. You mentioned identity politics, cancel culture, whatever you want to call these things. The Democrats, parts of the Democratic Party coalition giving enough oxygen to that stuff that allows Republicans to just scream and yell about it for two years or four years and really have an effect. You think it didn't have an effect in 2020, down, certainly down ballot, right? It is the thing that I'm most familiar about. I had Ed Ruben-Guyego, who's a Democratic partisan Arizona, and we did much better in Arizona than we did in Texas Florida. He said, I've never heard about you. He's a word of T-next. And I think it's just not to wait. People talk. I mean, it's not what they, the English faculty at Amherst has too much power in this party. All right, they really do. And they come up with all of these different things. And when people see that, they don't like it."
4sTOW6dycDw,17706,James Carville," The thing that I really deeply disagree with is when people say, well, if it's not by an only alternative, we have this harsh. Oh, no, please. There is more the most skill presidential feel of our lifetime, I think, was clear to the 1980 Republicans. All right. I think the potential democratic 2024 skill feel could even be better. Not that they had the same kind of experience with the skill. Josh Shapiro is such a skill politician. It's like ridiculous. Andy Poshir is so freaking skilled. You at Westmore, Warnock, Gina Ramau, I hate to start naming nice because somebody called you and you said, well, you didn't mention me."
UVjX1ALdHzc,5522,James Carville," Once you vote two times of political party, that's it. You're done. I mean, it's meant so much research on that. And that's the point that you stick with 90 huge percentage. You could vote there for somebody when you were 22 and you voted again for that party when you're 26 and 66 you're going to be voting for the same party. I don't know, but I'm not going to have to you. Well, OK, you're not. But that's a that's a studied, settled thing in political science. It's not that hard to pick out. And then you're starting to see some of the commentators are starting to figure this out."
rqkn4-_YX0c,11920,Joe Klein," Well, I think Trump is probably, well, first of all, I've known the guy for 40 years. I covered real estate in New York back in the 80s and I can tell you that he was a joke to all of his fellow developers. He was not considered a major player. He was considered a major marketer. And we are living through the golden age of marketing. If this is the golden age of anything. And I think that it was inevitable that the American people would begin to mistake reality TV for reality."
J81Cp5G-eH0,13521,Timothy Snyder," And the last two years, the Ukrainians have done a lot for us. You know, they, they've, they've defended the international order. You know, the basic principle of national order is that countries shouldn't be invading other countries and, and, and changing territory. They have held off in large measure of genocide, where the Russians occupy. They have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people, holding off a genocide. It's not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. You know, it's, there won't be a war in Europe so long as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army because there's no way the Russian army can fight another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course it can. In my view, anyway, they've made a war with China much less likely because they're showing how offensive operations are complicated, unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist party that doesn't want to be embarrassed is going to pay attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who are willing to take risks for democracy."
2x0-ffRSA78,8345,Timothy Snyder," That's the only way to really think about a war is how do you finish it victoriously. And then where we are now, of course, is that we're not supplying anything. One German company is out producing us in terms of our Chillery shells. The North Koreans are out supplying the entire West. And we for our own political reasons, which are unfortunately connected to Russia's political reasons are at the moment not doing anything at all for Ukraine. What I want to stress is that we're like we're the weak link. America is the weak link. The Russians see us as the weak link and unfortunately they're correct. On the battlefield, the Ukrainians are doing, I would say, surprisingly well, they've cleared out a huge swath of the Russia's Black Sea fleet, which is allowing them to supply the Near East and Africa with food. They've destroyed a huge number of Russian aircraft in the last few weeks, largely if not entirely freeing the sky. The Russians are on the offensive now, but it's slow and it's it's costing them. So this is still a war that Ukraine can win, but whether or not they win it depends upon whether they have allies who are capable of seeing the political stakes."
v_NaFn7vx5c,4759,Garry Kasparov," I'm tempted to offer this kind of moral equivalence. Yes, yes, this will all wrong, so we also made mistakes. Yes, but Putin did that. But remember, Vietnam Americans did... Well, Trump, right, Trump. We've got the same colors too. But exactly. And that's the essence of fake news. That's an essence of Putin's propaganda machine because he's no longer selling you one right ideology. It's not like he's preaching communism or any other ideology. He's selling chaos. I call them merchant of doubts. Maybe we're lying. Everybody's lying. So this... Truth is unknown. You cannot find the truth because there's so many versions of that. And that's what brings the free world down because that gives a huge advantage to the other side that doesn't care about the rule of law and just about international treaties. Yes, we did that. But you know, somebody else did that. No, Crimea, but cost of..."
nPcTDh9EuPU,2004,Garry Kasparov," There is no common ground with people who do not share our values, period. Because it's the free world succeeded because we all had the same values. We could have differences between America and France or England or Germany after World War II. But the values were the same. So we relied on a free market, on rule of law, on democracy, on free and fair elections. And looking at others, we should recognize that it could be a temperous solution. But the temperous solution lasts only as long as we are strong. And if we show any sign of weakness, they will go after us. Because that's the way they can gain political capital. And democratic regimes need confrontation to justify their existence, especially if we deal with countries like Russia or North Korea, when they have one dear leader, leader who just must project strengths. And he cannot afford even the slightest moment of hesitations and vulnerable."
SYNNukAWA_o,11083,Doug Sosnik," something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you know the convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely mega Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been Trump has already taken over the RNC. So if something were to happen in a Republican convention, I don't know what they would do except I do know that the magnet forces are going to decide what happens."
_McbAySKmJo,2664,Doug Sosnik," I think it's quite different on the Democratic side. When you're, as a party coalescing behind Biden, it's largely a vote for Biden as largely organizing principle about being for Biden is the stop Trump. And as I think I've mentioned before you, it's the first person elected president since 1988, George H.W. Bush got elected for essentially a Reagan III term, which I'm sure you remember quite well. Biden is the first guy since Bush to get elected without a political base. And so his base of support, if it is one, is an anti-Trump support. So if we take these people that have coalesced as a party, and the party's more of a federation of interests, really, than it is a party that's not a narrow focus on Republicans now, it's unclear what these delegates would do at the convention, if it got to that, because of the motivation of how they're acting."
OgBsuOVeDLl,28017,Anne Applebaum,"I think back on that and think where we are now and we now have this enormous Ukrainian army, and Ukraine has links and contacts all over the world and allies all over the planet and friends inside the United States and Europe. It's an amazing achievement. Let's take a step back and think where we were and where we are. The Russians did not win. They cannot win, actually. I don't think they can win without Trump. They could not win on the battlefield. Supposedly the second- largest army in Europe has been blocked by what was supposedly what they thought and what they described as a bunch of peasants. And it's just a reminder to us all of the hubris of great powers, which has hit us at times in our history, and also the weakness of the autocratic message. The Ukrainians believe in grassroots democracy, in an open society. They have created networks of civil society who help the army and who work in defense. The army itself is, mostly at this point, a civilian army. People were doing different kinds of jobs three years ago, and yet they have put up this extraordinary defense. I mean, I think whatever happens next, the example Ukraine has set other societies for how you resist autocracy and how you stand up to violence and brutality."
Of4KIJFU9a1,27756,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
nUkI9eUmTDx,27626,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
GR8v7f5SAsp,26782,Anne Applebaum,"I don't actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all this stuff. I'm not saying he's doing this purposely and it's a brilliant four-dimensional chess thing, but it sort of conceals the true, as you say, the really sustained and pretty systematic threat to the rule of law, the institutions, the norms that he's perfectly happy to carry out and pretty conscious that he's carrying out. Right? He's pretty conscious. And a really telling thing was said to me recently by a Russian journalist I know who's now in exile, who said to me that in the Kremlin ... And this will take a minute to explain, okay? In the Kremlin, they talk about Trump as the American Gorbachev, by which they don't mean leader of the free democracy and blah. Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore."
EbMhKIczbMM,26372,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
JFKDGHlobsL,24059,Anne Applebaum,"But Ukraine has recovered from the very low point of three or so months ago when they didn't have the prospects of war aid and they were really beginning to lose ground. So I would say on the ground, that's where we are. I suppose for all these reasons, including the new uses of technology or the new technologies, it's a little unpredictable actually, if things might break in one direction or another, but I guess, am I right that the safer prediction or assumption is not huge changes in the balance of power or balance of forces on the ground over the next several months? So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian."
rEfoygkk_qF,16057,John Bolton,"Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist."
q3X1QE2pVVm,13868,John Bolton,"It's not inevitable that a defeat on a nominee hurts an incoming president. When George HW Bush nominated John Tower for defense Secretary and Tower went down, he nominated Cheney. Life moved on. For Trump, I think it's different because he's trying to portray the image of invincibility, that he won by a tremendous margin, which he didn't. He got a plurality of the votes and he won. This time, there's no dispute who won, but this is not a huge victory. This was not a landslide. And when the bubble of invincibility gets pierced, I think Trump could find himself moving very quickly from being a newly inaugurated president to the other reality, which is he's a lame duck the day he takes office. So I think good political advice would be don't fight fights you're bound to lose over somebody like Tulsi Gabbard. I mean, if you really want Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary, I don't think he'll have much opposition. You fight for that. You don't fight for the ones that are basically collateral. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly."
MOjqQdhzFsN,13831,John Bolton,"I just hope it's not as bad as it looks right now, and I hope we are able to repair it when Trump is gone. But this is purely gratuitous. It is a completely self-inflicted wound. That's really eloquent and powerful and a little chilling, honestly. I mean, I hope we can repair it also, but it's also how much damage he's done at 100 and whatever we're now at, 10 days or something, less than that, I guess. With 1,300 days or something left, I mean, one assumes that this was the shock and awe period and there's some version almost to the mean or some checking or some rethinking or some mugged-by-reality moments here where he comes back but can also spiral a little out of control, right? And that's what I guess alarms me the most. You just don't know how much strain... We're putting a lot of strain on allies and structures and arrangements that one hopes can... They've been around a long time, they can hold up some, but can they hold up throughout? That's the question, I suppose. Well, it is, and we're not acting alone here. If you're in Beijing looking at this, you're sitting around saying, ""How are we going to take advantage of what Trump is doing on Taiwan, on the South China Sea, on a range of other issues?"" And other rogue states like North Korea are thinking the same, which is why how Trump handles the Iranian nuclear weapons program could be so important."
AJzEGOZM_kt,13442,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
tjQ2JghwUz6,3584,Eric Edelman,"Syria is probably not quite as attractive a place as UAE or Saudi for the American companies, but I suppose there are issues there too. Trump's always very sensitive to what minerals and oilncountries have that we're supposed to be able to exploit. But another country that came into the fray-it was kind of an interesting trip in that there were these outside countries that became quite central to it, at least in some of the conversations, Syria, as you've just said, explained very well -b ut also Iran, which suddenly Trump, in some, I guess offhand comments, you should explain, suddenly seems to have cast our Iran policy in a pretty... Not exactly a different light, but he was already going in that direction. But anyway, he made some news on Iran and what do you make of all that? Yeah, so he suggested that the Iranians have agreed in principle to a US proposal for resolving the nuclear issues with Iran. To remind everybody, President Trump, in his first term, withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was agreed to in 2015 by the Obama administration to put some limits, albeit limits that were set to expire in 10, 15 year's time, for the most part. In other words, a deal that kind of kicked the can down the road for dealing with the Iran nuclear problem, as President Obama himself admitted."
pyZkpR5Zl2z,8532,A.B. Stoddard,"So you just said, they could say he's going to govern erratically. Not one of them when they compliment Tim Scott, when they say that E. Jean Carroll verdict bothers them, they always say he can't win. They never say he shouldn't win. And I'm just waiting for one of them to tell the American electorate that he should not win and he should not have power again, and put it in the terms at least halfway as stark as Liz Cheney does when she says he cannot hold any office again, it's indefensible. Not one of them will say that. I don't expect them to go that far, but they've got to start with he can't win and he shouldn't win. And until that, like you said, they can come back with the random Rasmussen poll that they've got that shows that he's always going to beat Biden nine out of 12 times, blah, blah, blah. Speaking of Liz Cheney, final Republican question, and get to President Biden, the Democrats, I don't know, would it be better for her, would it be better for the Republican Party, such as hopes for a saner Republican Party would be better for the country, if she actually ran for president? She'll make her up her own mind and she's got all a million considerations obviously, but are you rooting for her to run or think that would be crazy and imprudent and she should do other things?"
GmxYtG3WvFb,7144,A.B. Stoddard,"Yes. I think that the serious-minded Democrats know that the age issue alone could decide it. That's just a fact. We have close elections, and Trump, he has survived and come back and looks like he's going to be the nominee. So some of them will definitely tell you, ""Oh, he's going to lose. He's totally going to lose. We're going to take the House back."" But a lot of them are very worried. And then universally, no one wanted Biden to run again. On the Republican side, they're having trouble picking a candidate. That's interesting. Some of the Democrats ...Wait a minute. I'm so struck by what you said. So I talked maybe a little more, I talked some of them, but I talk to a lot of the not-for-profit world, the Democratic democracy activists, and they're much more confident that Trump will lose again. And MAGA is clearly a minority view, and they say these outrageous things, and they're struck with these outrageous positions, all of which is sort of true. But I am struck, if I can extrapolate just a bit from what you're saying, that the elected politicians who actually are in touch with voters, unlike democracy activists, as much as I love them, who don't even have to be and aren't in touch with voters because they're not running for anything, that the elected Democrats are more nervous about the general election in 2024 than the Democratic good government types."
_g0nrTEp0Ai,3455,Doug Sosnik,"So that's changed. They had over 10 million people watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that's a lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people didn't want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the interview. And so I do think the Biden guys might say on his Thursday night appearance last week that if he took out a couple of bad snippets confusing the president of Mexico and Egypt, he took out a couple of those bites and it was largely a positive interview, but they only cherry-pick the worst parts. And I think there is probably was a concern that for the vast majority of people who aren't going to watch the interview but are going to see the coverage of it, that they're going to pick out a couple of these kinds of stumbles that Biden has sort of made a trademark of interviews, and that would define it. The last thing I'll say, though, is Biden should be running like he's behind, and the reason that he should run that way is because he is behind."
PsIF19n5rw8,8749,James Carville,"They release it over the week. It is good. ""The reasons to vote for Harris,"" you have to look at it. Protect Social Security, Medicare, 32. Will fight for reproductive rights, 32. Represents the future, 66. So just take the obvious, which is he is yesterday, he wants to go back. I want to push forward. Don't get distracted from what the public really thinks about this. Yeah, no, I actually talked about that UMass poll, I guess, in the newsletter yesterday or something, because I thought it's more helpful than a lot of others. It just seems to ask the questions intelligently about issues and stuff. And it shows Harris up three now, which seems to be about where things may be, which I guess- That gives you some confidence. It's certainly not outside of any... It's right in... But the questions are really worth taking a look at because it gives you a little bit more... It's deeper... I think these are, sounds like an oxymoron, but really talented political scientists. There you go. So this is your version of change of...? What was the '92 slogan? ""Change versus more of the same."" And you think that-? I would say change versus going, but yesterday versus tomorrow because he's not in, but you want to project him as stale, part of the same thing that keeps not producing..."
oMjYCqoVuBz,4017,Doug Sosnik,"They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report. And that was not great. And then he chose not to do the Super Bowl interview. And again, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, obviously in the big picture, no one's going to remember Super Bowl interview in 2024, but I don't know if that's sustainable for eight, nine months. Trump isn't exactly Mr. Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get... He's good at giving the impression that he's doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at least, and therefore people kind of feel like he's on top of things. Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press compared to Biden. So let me just say this quickly on the interview. These interviews have become staples of Super Bowl Sunday. They have changed over time and have become less soft interviews and harder interviews and more aggressive interviews. So that's changed. They had over 10 million people watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that's a lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people didn't want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the interview."
4oFdHhgCtFe,3096,David Axelrod,"It's separated communities that might otherwise be aligned. Hispanic communities, Black communities. And the same is true in New York and Denver, and- It could add to the chaos perception- Yes- ...on Gaza plus border, which are totally different things, of course, in the sense that Biden can't quite control either. Yes, that is it. I would not rely, if I were Biden's people, too much on the fact that Trump killed the most significant border bill. I think he's going to have to do something by executive order. Even if it's challenged in the courts, he has to look like he's seizing control of this situation. And then I think it makes the Republican obstructionism more effective, but that has to happen. The time is growing short. We've got a large migrant population, buses coming, many buses coming weekly from Texas, exacerbating it. And so I think the combination of protests over the war and tumult over migration and visible evidence of migrants, the diabolical mind would suggest that there'll be migrant tents set up, and not necessarily by the city in visible places just to underscore the issue. Where that issue is by the convention is important. Where the war is by the convention is important. There's been a tussle in the city about where these protesters can protest and that'll be I think significant, but yeah, I'm worried about it."
r3TzfEPey-m,3248,Eric Edelman,"I guess Vance, Vice President Vance, just seems to have canceled a, not officially announced but planned, trip to Israel out of unhappiness with what Israel is doing in Gaza. Maybe also general tensions with the Israeli government. I'm pretty struck that for a guy, for a ticket that campaigned a's very much in sync with pro-Israel hawks, and people like me, if I could say, who were traditionally pretty pro-Israel, getting beat up by all of our various friends or ex-friends and acquaintances about, ""How could he possibly support Biden and Harris, and that Trump's so much better on Israel."" He doesn't seem like... I mean, these negotiations with Iran... I mean, that was one of the major beefs about the JCPOA back in Obama years and I think Israel was kind of cut out and it was just as if Israel had no interest here, they were worth... I mean, occasionally we talked to them of course, and then they made their views known, but they weren't part of it. And suddenly Trump and Witkoff seemed to be going along their merry way and Israel's reading about things online a few hours later. I don't know, tell me about what's your general take on the US/Israel relations? What's your take on the impact of the trip on US/Israel relations?"
xKpO6IsUaLC,7306,Jack Goldsmith,"He thought the way people were being promoted was wrong. He thought some of the top people were bad, and he tried to put his footprint or fingerprints or vision on the department and I can't say that that's not sometimes healthy. I don't know. I can't assess... I just never studied enough to know whether Rumsfeld did more good than bad there. But so I'm not opposed, I don't think it's necessarily bad to... And the DOD is such a sprawling bureaucracy and a traditionally wasteful bureaucracy and a traditionally over-bureaucratized bureaucracy. I wouldn't say that there's not important reforms that can be done there and spending savings to be made. I definitely wouldn't say that. I don't think you would say that. How it's done is important. Who does it is important, whether it's seen as political and whether there are clear winners and losers that have a political valence, all that is bad. And this is where I want to move to the intelligence community. It could have impact on the ability of DOD as a fighting force. Now, the Trump people are saying they're going to come back in and get rid of the PC stuff and make it focused as a fighting force. And that's their theory of the case, is that DOD has gotten too far away of being a fighting force and they're going to restore it to that."
hx-8EWjzSzE,15214,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, I think that there's an understanding of that. But as I said, in every country you have the counterforce, sometimes directly supported by Russia, sometimes with direct links to the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. There are different configurations. And the big question in Europe over the next couple of years, four years is: will the advocates of European liberal democracy writ large, will they win the argument? Will they find a way to pool their resources and also become, I don't know, an AI power and a tech power as well? Or will they wind up being carved up by Americans and Russians and Chinese? And will these far-right parties play a role in that destruction? And as I said, I'm being very general because the tactics and the nuances are different in every country, but that's the big, that's actually now the central argument in European politics. No, that's very interesting and very helpful, actually, to put it in a way not in the weeds but in a bigger sense. But in a true bigger sense in the sense that they are, I think they themselves are thinking beyond the weeds, if I can fix metaphors here or say it awkwardly, you know what I mean? They've managed to pull themselves out. That sort of thing that's impressive about that meeting, pull themselves out of their own national and parochial, and issues with this and that, and suddenly they seem to be, more than I would have expected, honestly, presenting a kind of united front."

Might as well go for the guys who actually mean it, who'll stay, who will endure, who will stick by you, who may punish you, but who will at least be with you,"" you know? We could have done that, but instead, what happened was that the Ukrainian situation meant that people are now looking and saying, ""Actually, maybe these guys are serious."" So I think it's worth remembering that nothing succeeds like success and nothing fails like failure, right? I mean, and it's... Ukraine's success means that we're in a very different position today than we would have been had this not happened, and I think for countries around the world, countries we're not talking about, the erosion that that could have brought into the stability of a Western alliance, and I use that term very broadly. I include countries like South Korea and Japan in it, but you know, liberal alliance if you like, but it doesn't mean the same thing in American as it does in English. We're going to revitalize the word liberal here too. That's our next project here. Right, it doesn't mean communist, it doesn't mean socialist. It's to do with freedom, hence the word, hence the origins of the term."
sIlmUWucPZR,2461,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry. And these are people then who could be rapidly deported. So if you have an immigration offense on your record, that means you've been deported at least once and you can be deported very quickly. But part of the reason that that is true is because ICE's primary way of finding people is through fingerprint checks run by local law enforcement. ICE generally, and this is the history of immigration enforcement, has not in the last few decades, really since Congress 40 years ago told the agency to focus on people with criminal records, has used law enforcement connections as their main way of identifying new targets. So the people who are just garden-variety undocumented immigrants who have not ever had any interaction with the criminal justice system, which is the majority of them, those are the people that ICE doesn't necessarily know anything about. And if picked up, those people will have to go through a process, yes, and that process will take a long time. Whereas those with criminal records, they have fewer options for winning their cases. Congress has been very harsh on people with criminal records over the past few decades."

But when I was vice president cross chief of staff, and I'd been through this really before. I remember worrying a lot about some trip the next week somewhere. God knows what we were doing. Some senior person said to me, ""Calm down. You should do a good job. Make sure the trip's okay. But two things will matter for you as the vice president's chief of staff of the vice president: his convention speech and the debate."" That was good advice because it put things in perspective, and you could have a lot of little things be slightly suboptimal. This trip to Green Bay didn't go perfectly, whatever, but at the end of the day, the convention speech was drowned out by Buchanan so that was not so good. He did okay in the debate. But I'm curious about what you think about the convention. It seems to me those are the two known-what am I supposed to say-the two known unknowns we know are going to happen."

And so we had this bill that we were talking about where the only people who were posting about it were the vehement anti-vaxxers who didn't want it to pass. And then we were trying to say like, ""Oh, boy."" The legislators are saying, ""Well, all the people... When I poll my constituents, they're all in favor of it. When I go to my town halls, they're in favor of it. But then when I look at the internet, everybody's against it. What is happening here?"" And you start to see that dynamic of who are the communities that are active, and then beyond that, what is curated for you. And so the internet can really twist and shift your opinions depending on what bubble you wind up in. Yeah.

I didn't really expect Kash Patel and originally Matt Gaetz and then Pam Bondi and Pete Hegseth. I mean, that's just a level below lack of competence and lack of qualifications, which of course is not a bug, but a feature, right? You want people who are utterly and totally dependent on you personally, Donald Trump, not someone who has any independent standing. I was talking with someone who served a very high position in the military in the first Trump administration, and he made the point that it wasn't that easy to make these people do things they thought were really wrong. Not just because they legally could say, ""I'm sorry, I can't do that."" They had a whole network. They were well-established figures. They had many, many friends and colleagues across the military and across the US government. If General Milley to take an obvious example in 2020 had resigned, all the other chiefs would've resigned. A ton of three-star generals would've resigned. Maybe the Secretary of State would've felt he had to resign, Pompeo."
1kwxfh2Di5n,5954,Jack Goldsmith,"And so this is the thing that I very much worry about in the intelligence community, is not only hollowing out the intelligence community through the structural deregulation I was talking about. Again, acknowledging that there may be room for reform, but really just getting rid of some of our most important tools. I don't think when they get in there they'll do this. I just don't believe it because it's just too important and they're going to see that it's too important but we'll see. And you think, I suppose, I don't know if you've been looking at anything. We shouldn't discuss anything classified, but you've not been involved in the government for quite a while, but your impression from when you were in government and from following it subsequently, is what you said. I mean it really is important. I mean, this isn't just- There's no doubt. ... people talking about you know. It really makes a difference in our actual national security. A huge difference. And by the way, bipartisan panels have said this over and over again. The PCLOB has said this, intelligence committees have said this. There are problems with FISA that the Inspector General identified, and there was a debate about Section 702 and how it should be used. This is the broader forms of collection as opposed to the narrow traditional Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants."
GYl4ymk7V2l,6148,Aaron Friedberg,"I think from everything we know, Trump would go off in a very different direction that would I think scuttle the possibility of forming a tighter coalition of friendly countries economically to deal with China because I think he sees them all as unfair competitors and taking advantage of the United States and wants to impose tariffs on everybody. South Korea is as bad as China, or something, if you get on the wrong side of him. Right, and Taiwan, as he said in this interview with I think it was Businessweek back over the summer, Taiwan has stolen our semiconductor industry, and he raised this in the context of a question that asked him if he would be inclined to help defend Taiwan, which you would've thought from all of the tough talk from some of the people around him and from him would've been an easy answer to give. In fact, what he says is, ""We shouldn't be paying for their defense. They should be paying us, and they stole our semiconductor industry."" The attempt to make Trump out to be a consistent and coherent tough guy in dealing with China doesn't stand up to the facts. He did indeed impose or pursue or really permit people in his administration to pursue policies that were quite tough on China, and I suppose he or they deserve credit for that, but he also continues to express this personal affection for Xi Jinping."
TKtIeR8CEHi,6911,Jack Goldsmith,"Bill Clinton, when he did his pardons at the end of his term, he knew he was doing wrong, and he did it anyway, but there was this sense that you're not supposed to do that, and that kind of called norms or expectations of the office or self-constraint by presidents not to abuse the office, it's a really important constraint on the presidency. And Donald Trump came into office promising to explode those understandings. He tried to. In his first term, he did to some degree. He wasn't as successful as he hoped to be, but the problem is, as Bob and I wrote in our book, there were precursors to everything Trump did. Then Trump comes in and just takes a wrecking ball to all of these norms and understandings. Then we have the Biden administration where they too violate norms and understandings in some important ways and don't take steps to buck up the norms or to do the reforms that are needed to put the presidency on the right foot. Then Trump runs on an even bigger wrecking ball, pledging an even bigger wrecking ball. So we've had a downward spiral of these norms. The Biden pardon is definitely a big step in the downward spiral of the use of the pardon power, because as many people have pointed out, it's going to give Trump cover to do basically whatever he wants."
TzZT0o7fQ-o,6909,A.B. Stoddard,"So now I don't think that Ron DeSantis is the establishment, and I don't think he has to worry about that. He can say, ""Look, you've got your senators too, Tuberville and everyone else, you're running around with all your endorsements and you're a former president."" I think there's a way where he can also paint Trump as the establishment, or his allies can do that. So I don't think that he's really in that corner anymore. I don't think Ron DeSantis is running for vice president, they clearly can't stand each other, and they're both from Florida, so he has to say, ""I'm in this to win this. People are begging for an alternative. We have to have a president who does such and such. We can't support someone who does such and such."" He has to articulate that. And the most frustrating thing, Bill, about watching this primary, not only that they refuse to address January 6th, which is to me just such a dividing line in our whole American life in terms of what we expect from leaders, what we believe about our country, what our hopes are for the future, how we're seen in the world, none of them will say he shouldn't win. So you just said, they could say he's going to govern erratically."
EE9vO9KSj7K,5440,Aaron Friedberg,"But also what about the Trump tariffs? I mean, that's a big deal in foreign policy even though it's dealt within the economics departments more than in the political science departments, I guess. Right, right. Well, as far as what we should do, I've written this piece, it was in the last issue of Foreign Affairs , about how to respond to the so-called second China shock, which is this massive outpouring of manufactured goods and the possible damaging implications of that for new industries emerging in advanced industrial countries. Also, harmful consequences for the efforts of advanced democracies to de-risk by reducing their dependence on China for a whole array of so-called intermediate goods, everything almost down to nuts and bolts, but not quite critical minerals. That's one that's attracted a lot of attention. So if China is pushing out all this stuff at a very low price and the United States and countries in Asia and some countries in Europe are trying to build up their own domestic capacity, those efforts are going to be derailed because they will be undercut by, if they allow these goods to keep flooding into their markets, by these low-cost imports-and it'll also have damaging consequences-is for the prospects of developing countries that are trying to build up their own industrial capacity."
aXAUbB6hmcl,7539,AB Stoddard,"Also, and this was, I tried to make this clear as much as I could in 2024, whether in things I wrote or in speeches I gave, pre-pardoned so that they could carry out any illegal or unconstitutional order. So very, very dangerous who he would bring in the second time learning from the mistakes of the resistance he faced internally in the first term. Then those nominees, I agree with you, I think he thought that he wouldn't get them all through. It's kind of a wild card. In negotiations, you go crazy with your first offer expecting to lose it, and that gets you crazy light in your second choice. So that's really not what happened. Republicans folded. It empowered Trump, but now that I've listened to Anne Applebaum, who had recently described Victor Orbán's breaking down of all of the different components of Hungary that would help him concentrate and centralize power, you see that it is textbook, right? The speed surprised to me. I knew he would do all these things, but it really helps once he got those nominees in place, and that was a real victory to see the Republicans fold that quickly. Watching him go after universities, the free press, sort of everything at once, and then you combine Elon, this X factor we didn't expect."
jyrl5RR0mob,5845,Tim Snyder,"It's frozen."" So, it's an active hot war. It's a war of attrition in which you're right- But isn't it also, it's a Russian aim in some conflicts, whereas here, their aim isn't really a frozen conflict, is it? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, their aim as they make clear every day in the statements of their highest political authorities and their propaganda shows every evening, their aim is to destroy the Ukrainian state. I mean, for people who want to be fooled, there's still stories out there about the Russian language or NATO or whatever, but what they tell us every day is they're trying to destroy Ukrainian state and society. That's their war aim. And so long as they haven't done that, they're going to try, they're going to keep trying to do that on the Ukrainian side, yeah, they can sustain this for a long time, provided that they don't engage in ill thought through offensive operations or lose too many people. The main constraint that they have is that there are only so many Ukrainians and it's reasonable of them to be taking that constraint into account. Russia has more people, but also Russia, the Russian leadership doesn't care at all about losing its own people, whereas Ukrainian leadership to its great credit, does care. They have to balance preserving territory, winning the war and not losing too many people on the battlefield."
TGdXE8hU73O,7104,Robert Kagan,"And that's again often discussed as a tiny, weird footnote in American history, but obviously in the south, it was much more than a footnote, and even in certain aspects beyond the south. I feel like that's an aspect of today's authoritarian movement or anti-liberal movement. That comes back in a big way, right? Yeah. All these guardrails against, well, you can't really do that, that would be acting outside the law. You can't just trash the courts even when they're not giving you a decision. There has to be a certain modicum basis of respect. If we don't have the rules of the game, then there are no guardrails. That's eroded so much faster in the last 10 years than I guess I would've expected. Yeah. Yeah. And again, it is to some extent reverting to norm in America, as you were alluding to. Even during periods of liberal ascendancy from the 1940s and '50s, there were still lynchings going on in the south and there was a degree of tolerated racial violence in the United States for most of our history. We take for granted that we now have a federal government, which has been acutely sensitive to the violations of liberties including in the South. Again, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock in order to enforce desegregation rules."
hBTQSwiGvf1,3154,Eric Edelman,"I don't know, tell me about what's your general take on the US/Israel relations? What's your take on the impact of the trip on US/Israel relations? What happens over the next few months? So I think there are a lot of very nervous Israelis in the government and in the various attentive parts of the Israeli national security elite about all this. As you say, there has been a real pattern here of the administration doing things without any kind of coordination or consultation with Israel really. And when you add them all up, it's things that if Biden or Kamala Harris had done them, people's heads would be exploding all over Washington. They had direct talks with Hamas, which has never happened before. The President announced the contacts that the US had had with Iran and the opening of negotiations between the US and Iran without consulting with Bibi. This was a fait accompli that was announced to Bibi, he was informed of it, as I understand it, at Blair House shortly before he went across the street to meet in the Oval with the President. Similarly, the hostage deal for Etan Alexander, we can all be glad that the last living American hostage was brought out, but it was done without regard to the fact that there are still a lot of Israeli hostages, not to mention some dead Americans who are still being held by Hamas."
2Rg9dKk0gYA,5527,Tim Snyder,"So the people in the US, the political forces in the US who wanted us to stay out, which slid very quickly into sympathy with Nazi Germany, were more sympathetic after the brutality and after all the excuses about its German parts of Czechoslovakia or whatever had collapsed, and after it was perfectly clear what was happening. I don't know quite what... you've thought a lot about the psychology as it were of freedom and tyranny. I don't know. I was just so struck by this. I had sort of had a naive view, I think, that they kind of stumbled into an untenable position by late 1940. They chose that untenable position in late 1940. I appreciate your saying that because it's such an important point, and I'm going to answer it starting from somewhere completely different and then work my way back. If you look at far-left sympathy for Stalinism and for the Soviet Union, when does it start to splinter? This is a story you know better than me probably, but the left, the European left, the North American left starts to get uninterested in Stalinism when there's no longer mass violence. So, it's not that the far-left... I'm talking about the extreme left now, like the communist left. But it's not that people like the Soviet Union despite the violence."
87i4RW63ns9,9936,Mark Esper,"But anyway, so the bottom line is we talked him out of a rapid precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan only to see what, 7, 8, 9, 10 months later Biden do the exact same thing, a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan. The place falls apart. We have 13 brave U.S. service members killed. We have any number of Americans left behind. It was complete disaster. It will exceed in terms of a dismal moment in our foreign policy what we did in Saigon in what, '75? But we talked Trump out of that, and that was just one example of where I think this staff role is important. In the second term, the question gets back to will people be there to talk him out of bad ideas? His instincts weren't necessarily wrong to want to get out of Afghanistan. In many ways, I shared that view. I talk about it in the book, but how you get out of Afghanistan under what terms and conditions matters, and that's where the nuance often gets missing. Certainly in the campaign, as you said at the very beginning, we'll close with this, he says what he means usually, fairly for a politician who's candid in his own way. He certainly hasn't shown much instinct to go back towards, let's say, the Mark Esper, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence view of the world, and more of an instinct to double down on America First, and it's different, whatever that means, but it's different iterations."
2pLzMXR9pfA,5560,Larry Summers,"So when the Fed moved, that was bigger for Australian long-term interest rates than when the Australian Central Bank moved. So I think what happens here has very big effects, and if we make a mess of our economy, that will make a mess of other economies as well and that will be really quite unfortunate. That will be very serious because when those economies are in a mess, that will in turn reverberate onto ours. There's a classic analysis of the Depression by Charles Kindleberger that is summarized by saying that Britain was no longer able to lead and the United States was not yet willing, as the world spiraled down from 1929 to 1932. The United States is no longer willing and China is not yet able, might be an analysis of a global set of economic and financial problems going forward. On the other hand, I do think it's important and fair, Bill, to see a kind of silver lining in the moment, which is that when your problems are caused fundamentally by your own foolish acts, they are more solvable than if your problems are caused by some set of forces that are beyond your control. And it's the flip side of the fact that these problems are not in the stars but in ourselves that this is what one might call iatrogenic economic illness."
THgLjj-jbQO,5844,Invisible Rulers,"RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, this is where the TikTok conversation, which is a huge, whole other topic of conversation, but this is where the worries come about China controlling the algorithm. What could you do if you did have the capacity to manipulate a feed for explicit political ends? And TikTok's algorithm is very effective. People really like it. It's one of the few things that really blew up, even as there were other platforms where people spent a ton of their time. TikTok doesn't actually really care who you follow, that's not really the most important weight in the feed. Whereas most of the other platforms rely on what's called the social graph, TikTok cares a whole lot more about just showing you content topics that are interesting to you in each individual video, as opposed to stuff from your friends. And so that's where you start to see that question of who controls your feed. And right now, just to bring things back to the other question, the other half of your question, could we do better? I would argue that that same concern about what happens when China controls your feed, right? That was the topic around TikTok, is what happens when a CEO you don't trust controls your feed? What happens when Elon Musk controls your feed, right?"
Rhy9T4I2CIL,7104,Jack Goldsmith,"But it's an interesting question whether it will even work. It's not easy to reform these organizations. The contrast with Rumsfeld's important. I mean, he knew what he was doing. He knew where the dead bodies were. He knew what the channels of communication were. He knew how to reach down and do things. And there's always this problem that populist governments that put in non- experts to lead agencies fail because they don't know how to manipulate the bureaucracy. They don't know how to reform it. We'll see. I mean, we'll see. Again, depending on how, if Patel is confirmed, how he goes about it, depending on how Gabbard, if she's confirmed, how she goes about it, there are definitely right and wrong ways to go about reform and if there are wrecking balls that didn't work, it's never worked out before, frankly, and it didn't work for Stansfield Turner. He tried it, took that approach and he ended up doing the opposite by the end of his term as CIA director under Carter and other intelligence community leaders have had this. I'm not saying that reform is not a good idea and that certainly looking at reform isn't. And it's just a question of how they go about it and whether they're going to... This is another important point, so much of effective government is not just about the exercise of hard executive power to coerce people into doing things."
-6lLR-lxXJM,17397,Anne Applebaum,"He will be pro- defense. He will pro-Ukrainian. He will want to work with France and Britain and Poland and others to create some kind of new defense alliance within the various alliances. And so, I am going to be positive today and I'm going to say it's a good thing. Yeah. I want to get to the alliances and the rest of Europe in a second. Just one more note on Germany itself. I guess I'm struck that-we're speaking Monday morning right after the Sunday elections-they fell a little, well yeah 20.7% of vote or something like that, the AFD, Alliance for Deutschland. Incidentally, Vance's intervention was more direct. He supported the AFD. Certainly, on Twitter and said nice things about them repeatedly before coming to even to Munich. And of course, Musk was just all in including putting a heavy thumb on the scale in terms of X. Algorithms. Yeah... what was Twitter. There's a very interesting study that showed the degree to which it's not just, oh, the algorithms naturally lead to a certain kind of extremism, which is probably true incidentally as well. But that they actually, if you had a neutral test, so to speak, they push towards the, I guess we're not quite supposed to call it a neo-Nazi party, but I call it an anti- anti-Nazi party."
XCX_b7i3HZu,6944,Robert Kagan,"But you wrote a piece, and let me put the anti- liberalism thing this way: we've spoken, I think quite a lot, about the illiberalism of the current authoritarian movement on the right. You wrote a controversial piece. Was it 2016 I think?... where you said, ""It's worth calling it fascism of a distinctively American sort,"" but still use that term. And then there was big controversy about that, and has been for years. So tell me a little, why anti-liberalism as opposed to illiberalism on the one hand, which is very commonly used, or fascism, which I suppose is a little more provocative? Well, it's just a word, but what I'm trying to get to is that there is a real ideological opposition to liberalism, obviously in the world historically, and also in the United States. And the thing about illiberalism is it sounds like people are misbehaving potentially without realizing it, or they're not behaving in a liberal fashion but it doesn't suggest that they are hostile to liberalism. And that's the point I'm trying to get to, because I think this book was written backwards. When I write histories I write them forwards and try to understand, get into the... but this time I was trying to answer a question. And the question is, why are so many people supporting a guy who evidently wishes to overthrow the nature of our system?"
Y4b0-vHUInz,13246,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, I was in Denmark a few months ago, and it's already happened there. The idea of the United States as like our benign friend, I mean, I think the US was the biggest Danish market, and Denmark had this special relationship with the US partly about Greenland. There was a long history of sharing military exercise up there, and actually the US kept nuclear weapons in Greenland in the 1950s. And so there's a very long, complicated, benign, friendly relationship between Denmark and the United States, and it is shattered. People are shattered by it and shocked by it. And they now look at the United States as a country that may seek to undermine Denmark. And in a way, Denmark is the most dramatic example. But as you say, there's a version of that in Germany. There's a version of it in Poland. There's a version of it everywhere. No, the Danes, in my experience, I mean limited, but conferences and some stuff even in government were maybe the most unproblematically pro-American country in Europe. Certainly in Western Europe. They didn't have issues like France did. They weren't... Germany was complicated, unification and some trade economic rivalry. The Danes were happy. They were sort of unambiguously pro-American was my general feeling. Partly they probably wanted a little bit of barrier, bulwark against Germany."
Uw7eQBjjKfl,3428,David Axelrod,"Biden hangs out with Democratic donors who aren't that populist, if we could be honest, on economics. No, they're actually more like Republican donors used to be. Yeah. They're wealthy and comfortable. And then, he has activists in his party who care a lot about, let's say, the left's cultural issues, and in a weird way, who's telling him to actually focus on mainstream, let's call it, new deal-like- Bread and butter issue. ...New Deal-like semi-populist... Bread and butter issues. Yeah. Bread and butter issues. I think that Biden needs to embrace them, and they need to hammer them, they need to hammer them consistently. I really do believe Biden's problem isn't with suburban... Obviously, he wants to run up the score there, but he's doing pretty well there, he's doing pretty well with highly educated white voters. He's not doing all that badly. He's doing badly, as Democrats have for several cycles, with white non-college voters, but young people... Listen, the Biden Coalition in 2020 very much relied on, he got 87%, 88% among African-American voters, he got 65% among Hispanic voters, he won young voters by 20 or more. All of these constituencies are soft now. Trump's getting upwards of 20% in most polls of African-American voters, Hispanic voters are running even now, even young voters are running even."
CuFp4d-zKs2,3798,Eric Edelman,"We would never have done that. But one constant mistake I've seen in my experience in government is American intelligence analysts and government officials assuming that people will or won't do things because we would never do it that way. It's a good prescription for being surprised. So, Bibi's got a time window. I don't know exactly when it expires before he feels he's going to have to act. And does he act in the face of Trump saying, ""Don't do it,"" or while the negotiations are going on? I don't know. That's going to be a very difficult political calculus he's going to have to make. And a lot of it goes to his personal legacy. I think he knows that whenever the time comes for a reckoning over what happened on October 7th, which he has successfully postponed for going on two years now, he is going to bear a lot of the onus for what happened on October 7th, 2023. And I don't think he wants that to be his legacy. I think he wants his legacy to be, I'm the guy who destroyed Hamas. I destroyed Hezbollah and I destroyed the Iranian nuclear program. I think that's how he wants to go out. So we'll see how he calculates all that. But a pretty... I mean, this comes to a head probably during the summer, right?"
hho3Vo-T4GY,9268,Robert Kagan,"Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies. Right? Right. And the one thing that... Trump is able to amass a pretty broad coalition precisely because his policies have nothing to do with economics. So he's not threatening, for instance, to take money away from rich people, or even very well-to-do people in general, and give it to a working class movement. He doesn't really offer any economic answer to those in the working class. What he offers to them is revenge. What he offers to them is sympathy and support for what is effectively white anxiety. And whenever you say, ""It's the working class that supports Trump."" It's the white working class that supports Trump. The non-white working class does not support Trump, overwhelmingly in the other direction. And so I just think intellectuals in America are heavily influenced by economic and ultimately Marxist interpretations of how society works. And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that."
yclR7LyuBeV,5204,Tim Snyder,"They didn't actually treat their somewhat stooge-like fellow travelers here in the US or in Western Europe with great respect, right? It's a very funny mix I think in both cases. I'm sorry, part of my mind is now thinking about how to translate Nashatrampushka . Now thinking of ""Trumpkin Dumplin',"" something like that. Oh, that's good, yeah. But yeah. In both cases, there's this mixture of authentic fear of American power. And then... because this is one of the odd... Taking a big view, I don't know if you'll agree. But objectively, the comparison between US and Russia now is nothing like the Cold War. Right. Right. There's this discourse of multipolarity, which I accept is more valid with respect to China. But if it's just a US-Russia thing, there's no bipolarity anymore. The differences in power on every dimension except the nuclear, and the nuclears, for most purposes, are relevant, the difference is so extraordinary. And so it's a mixture where they are very afraid of the US, because they know if the US actually gets its act together, essentially we can win the war in... It sounds very condescending, but we could win the war on Ukraine without noticing. The amount of help we have to give to the Ukrainians, which would be very significant for Ukraine..."
pvwEpNtBU18,3368,Doug Sosnik,"We're going through the biggest transition in our country since the late 1800s, when we went from an agrarian society to an industrial society. It's a 30 or 40 year transition. In the short term you have a few winners and a lot of losers. We're going through the same kind of transition now, from a 20th century top-down manufacturing industrial society, to a 21st century digital and global one. It's the biggest transition over 100 years. We're in a transitionary moment in our history right now. 10 out of the last 12 election cycles, the country's voted to either change control of the house, senate, and/or president. And so, they're voting against who's in power now, who's forward in power. And we are in this transition period that we're going to break out of this transition period. As we settle into this 21st century digital global world, you see all kinds of things that are happening that are going to open up opportunities for people they haven't had. And the turn of this last century, we created high schools in America to train people to work on these machines. You're seeing as an example now, companies and state governments all across America, that are now waiving the requirement that someone's a college graduate to get a job. Because that's the only way they could in the past figure out if someone's qualified."
4RP-Fukz0Q4,6301,AB Stoddard,"That's really well said AB, and a very good note to end on, and we'll get back together maybe at the end of the fiscal, I don't know, September 30th, whatever would be a good time at the end of the year and really see where we are. But it's been, you deserve a lot of credit for, I think, seeing the essence of what Trump was up to very early and then trying to alert people. And I hope this conversation has been helpful to people as well. So thank you for joining me again. Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
f0jQAcizdF3,6171,Jack Goldsmith,"Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. So last topic. I'll let you go in a minute. I mean, Congress, so we barely mentioned it, which probably itself tells us something about some decline of Congressional oversight, and competence, and supervision of all these things, or maybe not. I mean, there's a partisan issue of Republican Congress will do less because we'll be oversight than the Democratic, but I don't know. A lot of the things you mentioned before suddenly were challenged and I know your own cases. I mean, there were Congressional committees that were also looking at this and they had some influence on the actual outcomes, right? They did, yep. Congress can't push back and especially in the intelligence side, but let me just back up. So first of all, Congress is still more involved in this stuff than you think. Every year, there's a National Defense Authorization Act. It's the only statute, maybe along with tax statutes that actually get through every year. In fact, it's become the Christmas tree of statutes where everyone tries to get something in the National Defense Authorization Act because it gets through. And so every year, Congress weighs in with about 2,000 pages of new law working with the DOD, sometimes working against DOD. It's a complicated process and at least continuing through the last 20 years, 30 years, both the Intelligence Committees and the Armed Services Committees have done pretty robust oversight of the DOD and the Intelligence Committee."
5S3Lc5sD1Gy,2342,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That's another program where there is still strong enough business support for the visa that it will probably remain in effect even if there're some minor changes. I should let you go soon. You've been very generous with your time, and this is such a complicated-but so interesting actually- to get at. So, what do you think...? I guess two questions. What are the ranges of things we could...? Where could we be in, I don't know, six months, where could we be in 18 months perhaps in terms of actual policy and actual effects of policy on the ground? I mean, does America look very different or is a lot of this pretty incremental and pretty...? Might be very terrible for certain people, individuals treated unfairly and I don't mean to minimize all that to 78 people in Bakersfield or whatever. Or if you want a different point of view, you could say, ""Good that we're getting rid of some people,"" but net-net, does it all look very different? And also the second related question I guess is do you see key inflection points where we'll know who's winning the debates within the administration, how willing Congress is to go along, and is there a moment when you'll be able to say, ""I think I know now what the next two or three years look like because these decisions were made on the Hill or in the administration,"" or I suppose on the courts for that matter?"
qiiMgy7eYrX,6431,Aaron Friedberg,"I mean, let's go back to what we started with. If we're faced with this rough alliance of authoritarian powers that now is behaving in a very aggressive way, and if you accept the proposition that in order to deal with that we can't simply rely on our own power and resources, but we have to cooperate with our friends and our friends are going to be the people with whom we share values as well as interests, it's going to require a coherent strategy, and it's going to require a strategy that can be sustained and justified and explained to the American people over a period of time. It's not just a case of periodically ordering a strike on this terrorist leader or that. And it certainly isn't something that's going to be possible if you have a leader who is constantly haranguing and in effect threatening our traditional allies because of some belief that they're taking advantage of us and not paying the proper price for our protection of them. And that too I think is missing from some of these efforts to make sense out of what Trump says or to recast his previous record and fit the pieces together into something that is more coherent than I think it actually was. You mentioned the thing about personality, just to take one example, some people who are making the case for Trump say, ""Well, he would be a consistent friend of Israel, and the Biden administration has put pressure on Israel,"" and there is truth in that."
GcdGM0q8MRA,5984,Larry Summers,"I absolutely avoid any analogies with Germany in the 1930s, but I don't think it's necessary to avoid analogies with Argentina in the '40s, '50s and '60s. Argentina was a country where its standard of living in the first half of the 20th century weree in the same broad range as that of the United States. People looking at the world after the Second World War put Argentina in a category of countries with Canada and Australia. Educated, mature populations with substantial natural resource wealth and bright prospects. And Argentina's path was very, very different. And the roots of that lie in populist political economy. They lie in authoritarians with appeal to the people of the soil, pursuing nationalist, protectionist, economic policies, engaging extensively in crony capitalism for their own benefit and that of their friends, disregarding intellectual expertise in any of its various forms, eventually seeking to intimidate opposition. And over time, those lead to the desecration and maybe ultimately the destruction of a national project. And that is what is at risk, it seems to me, here in the United States. I hope that there will be a sufficient uprising of concern that that will not be what takes place, and I think the most likely thing is that this will be remembered as one of the many unfortunate episodes in American history from which when events were unfortunate, but friends were favorable."
LbRAST5lx5Z,5872,Aaron Friedberg,"Because, well, just taking the defense spending as an example, we're headed towards 3% of GDP, far lower than the average over the course of the Cold War. If you believe, as I'm inclined to do, as this report suggests that we need to increase to say 5% of GDP or 6% of GDP, that's a huge political struggle there. And there are all kinds of consequences. Are you going to cut spending here, are you're going to increase taxes? If you believe it's necessary to make that change in strategy because of judgment about the character of the international environment, you're going to have to persuade people of that. You're going to have to start by portraying that external environment in a way that's accurate and is going to be frightening to people, but also coherent. And that makes clear why and how we can and need to respond in a coherent and stable and sober way. And on that score, again, I think Trump fails utterly because he doesn't see the world in that way. He doesn't speak that language, and I don't think he's going to pursue the kinds of policies that will make that possible over a period of time. So he's risky, but maybe there's something about the way people are viewing the world, which doesn't make it clear just how risky he is."
gQyXkN6gXHX,6234,Invisible Rulers,"But so much of it is related to activation, just getting people who already believe a thing to act on it. And when you have the capacity to sort people algorithmically and to show them content that is tailored to them and get them to... And when they begin to... I want to make really clear here also that the public is not passive. People who are on social media have a lot of agency. I think everybody thinks like, ""Well, I have agency when I'm on social media, but those other people over there don't."" No, that's not true. Everybody's experience is just like yours. And so when we say, I always think about the phrase, ""it went viral,"" like it just magically happened. No, people hit buttons, they did things. And I think we don't think in terms of collective behavior, but that is what social media is for. It's like assembling a murmuration of starlings or a school of fish, where all of the sudden, everybody spontaneously assembles in a particular direction. The cues, the social cues that bounce from person to person, that's what social media is for. And so, just like I said, so 2012, some governments realize it, and ISIS realizes it, to draw that example, and then Russia realizes it. Russia invests very heavily in online propaganda to justify its invasion of Crimea."
4D9TYr9npSM,6570,Aaron Friedberg,"Yes. And I don't think we're going to see the cycling through more traditional figures who will then get fired or quit after six months, 12 months, 18 months. It just doesn't seem like that's likely for one thing because most of those people have been eliminated. But there are, if you go down the list and think of people, Robert O'Brien or Pompeo or people have mentioned Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio... At least before Trump came on the scene, I would've said those people were all kind of traditional hardline, Reagan-type Republicans. And to varying degrees, when they've spoken on some of these issues, they've continued to take that kind of position, always being careful, of course, not to contradict Trump or not to be critical of him. So that's a cast of characters who could conceivably emerge or some of those people could emerge. We don't know what their views would be once they were in office. What we do know is that ultimately they would have to do what Trump wanted them to do or they would be out. But at least at the outset, it's possible that you could have a Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor, who again, at least based on their expressed views, might appear to be more, how to say it?"
UYcE0Bi0cZa,5687,Aaron Friedberg,"You think on China and I think on Ukraine, we both think on Ukraine and so forth, actually supporting Israel, but they certainly haven't made one of their centerpieces of their rhetoric that it's a very dangerous world out there and we need to do more than we've been doing. And these are real... It's a little bit more of a reassuring, we're doing, everything's fine. NATO is stronger than ever, and we don't have troops in harm's way. And that undercuts, of course, the argument that you're making here and that we're saying that Harris might make or that a responsible leader would make about alerting the American people to the danger. It's not totally... Obviously it's not... You can have some of both, obviously and Cold War leaders did that a lot. I was thinking about Bush in '88 who had, I think there was an actual debate in the Bush campaign in '88 about should they take credit for the improvement under Reagan and for the fact that Gorbachev was clearly leading the Soviet Union in a somewhat different direction than his predecessors had. And the fact that the world seemed safer by November '88 when George H.W. Bush was running to succeed Reagan, then it had probably in '80 or '84, maybe a little less concerned about things blowing up, literally."
k-K54yaflV-,17354,Anne Applebaum,"Never mind what the speech actually said. It was understood as an insult. Remember who's at the Munich Security Conference? It's defense ministers, generals, security analysts. I went to an event there where people were talking about, there's a big problem in the Baltic Sea of Russian ships cutting the fiber optic cables that do communication between countries. And this is a very serious sabotage problem. Almost everyone in the room is someone who thinks daily about Russian cyber attacks, Russian sabotage, the potential for Russian military attack, Russian propaganda. So they're focused on solving a particular problem. And Vance walked into the room and basically said, ""I don't care about your problem. I'm going to talk about something different, and I'm going to insult you while I'm doing it."" So everyone got that message. And then I also think that the last few days, Trump repeating Russian propaganda. Trump saying Zelensky is a dictator. Russia started the war. Making up statistics about how much money the US has spent. Ukraine. Ukraine started the war, excuse me, the Ukraine started the war. It's hard for you to make yourself say that, it's such an unbelievable Orwellian lie. It is. So, Ukraine started the war. But also making up numbers, acting as if Europe had no role in supporting Ukraine. Actually, if you total up the money, both economic and military, Europeans have given more to Ukraine than United States and paid a larger price in all kinds of other ways as well."
kihn1eA1EBD,7085,AB Stoddard,"But yeah, I do think it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing. I mean, the law firms collapse because they see Trump still at 45, 46% maybe in some of these polls, and they think he's got Republican Congress. And then when the law firms collapse, I think people think, ""Well, geez, if these big institutions, universities, law firms are going along with Trump, I guess there's some truth to what he's doing. It's not so dangerous. They wouldn't do it if it were really dangerous."" So I think it's a bit of a spiral there of lack of alarm. What do you think about- do you think the more practical effects, let's assume tariffs have some negative economic effects, either inflationary or recessionary or both, I suppose, and let's assume that people can't get their social security questions answered and that sort of thing. Republicans, I guess, are going to try to cut some spending, some pretty basic Medicare/Medicaid-type spending in the budget. I mean, do you think normal politics kicks in at that point and maybe Trump is less popular six months from now? I do. I do think that there's going to be a real erosion in essential services that you can fire the nuclear guys and rehire them, but what we're looking at particularly with just this week at HHS."
YQgt194XfRF,8750,James Carville,"So this is your version of change of...? What was the '92 slogan? ""Change versus more of the same."" And you think that-? I would say change versus going, but yesterday versus tomorrow because he's not in, but you want to project him as stale, part of the same thing that keeps not producing... Anything like that. But going back I think is a key. Yeah. Going back is the advantage. Going forward. We don't want to go back. We don't want to push forward. Yeah. Now for all the change and uncharted waters, we still have an electoral college. And I suppose... Well, tell me mean, do you have any controversial or not obvious views on which states matter or the Midwest versus the Sunbelt and all that kind of stuff? Nothing changes math. And the math is you got to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. I think Georgia has tightened up... Actually, I think North Carolina much bigger opportunity than people think because I think there could be some negative coattails with the governor's gubernatorial candidate there. Obviously Arizona is more competitive. Maybe the state that traditionally votes Republican I feel better about is North Carolina. The state that has traditionally voted democratic that I don't feel as good as I should is Nevada. Now I take the swab."
nLpl6NppZNb,6217,Tom Tugendhat,"So it was a hell of a thing to be there for their independence day this year, as you can imagine. And it was very moving to be with some very, very brave people. And what struck you about their mood, their sense of what they've done and their prospects? And also say a word, I want to look present forward mostly, but I think people forget how close run a thing it was shortly after February 24th, or maybe not. But I feel that everyone has of settled into a kind of, ""Well, of course they beat back to the Russians and now it's a kind of tough slog,"" but that was not an ""of course"" was it? No, not at all. And I have to say, I mean, I don't think I'm alone, in fact, I know I'm not alone, because I spoke to a lot of my military friends who are still serving, and we firmly expected the Russians to win in a matter of weeks. I know the American military did as well. So this was a pretty universal view. In fact, so much so that you may remember President Biden offered a helicopter to go and get President Zelensky out. And he very famously responded, ""I don't need a lift, I need ammunition."" And thank God he did because his courage solidified the defense of Kyiv."
GNJ9UDSuSKf,8108,AB Stoddard,"And watching Bill Cassidy, a serious man, senator from Louisiana, a doctor, struggle with that vote, knowing that RFK Jr has really promoted quack science and conspiracies for a long time. That he's anti-vaccine... Bill Cassidy's on the fence... was really, you could really see him turning himself into a pretzel and he ends up supporting him and now is going to call him before his committee to talk about all the firings and he's upset and concerned. That was all predictable. RFK Junior is a really troubled guy and really an unstable person who also just spews falsehoods. And so this was not something to take a chance on. All of this was predictable, and it's really quite enraging. Jonathan Rauch, who's a very well-known writer and will be known to people who listen to this, famously posted around 10 days ago that he had a friend who drove two hours for her breast cancer chemotherapy treatments that were part of an NIH trial only to arrive at the location to be told without any phone call or warning that it had been canceled. And there was no future plans for any new protocols or any new treatments for her. And this kind of thing is going to ripple out through people's lives, people who have kids with special needs, people who have diabetes, whatever it is."
5NfG7dqKGku,6496,Jack Goldsmith,"And that's never been tried before in an aggressive way. Trump started to do it in his first term. I think this is the big, underappreciated approach to deregulation here, not through using the Administrative Procedure Act, but just undermining the administrative state through manipulating the Vacancies Reform Act, which you and I have talked about offline, impoundment to try to not allow the agencies to spend appropriated monies. All of these things are very law heavy and will be litigated and are complicated issues, but they've got room to run. And this is the other big theme I just want to get out on the table. Trump doesn't need to break the law to accomplish a lot of his ends. The President of the United States has enormous authority under Article II and under various grants of authority from Congress to do a lot of these things. And some of them will be litigated and some, they'll be pushed back, and it's going to be an interesting to see how much they win and how much they lose and how well they are organized to defend their legal positions. They did a terrible job in the first term on that, but this is where the action is going to be, in my opinion. Does that make sense? Yeah, very much."
6tTRhufdgmL,8506,Mark Esper,"I'm always reminded of when our embassy was under siege, Mike Pompeo calling me up and saying, ""Look, I need help here and here."" I said, ""Mike, you got it. I'm sending in the Marines here. I'm going to send in the paratroopers there. Tell your ambassador to hold on, help is on the way."" We quickly deployed troops, and these were decisions he and I made together without going to the President, but knowing, of course, the President would fully support it. So having that type of trust and relationship made a big difference. It really brings home how important, though, those senior civilian positions are. Also, in terms of just DOD for a second, it's not like the military isn't affected in terms of internal promotions, internal rules and regulations. Of course, those are also ultimately in civilian control, so different kinds of secretary of defense responding to a president who's unleashed, so to speak, could change things within the military as well as the relations between the political officials in the military. Sure. Look, at the end of the day, for senior officers that have to go up for Senate confirmation, even for any officer, frankly, they're all subject to confirmation by the Senate. The president can put anybody on that list he wants or pull anybody from that list he wants."
nBtkyYoytQM,7749,AB Stoddard,"And that I think that they believe there's some guardrails that are going to magically appear like airbags in a car accident. And Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, will have a conversation with a very high-ranking person, the CIA, and all this nonsense will be stopped. That's not what happens. It accelerates and it grows because the more power you give him, the more he'll take and the less pushback he gets, the freer he is. And so, I think what we've seen in the last couple of months is that he's been given permission and he will take it. That's the way Trump is, and he believes... his pathologies create a story for him that this is what the people want, that they adore everything he does. And so when he doesn't have to take a lot of phone calls from senators over tariffs or crapping on Vlodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office or whatever he feels, that's permission from more destruction. So he's not acting like a man who is worried about reelection when he talks about a third term, he says that people are demanding it because everything he's doing is so popular. So I think people need to not underestimate the fact that things could be much, much worse in three months or a year."
pcI7m0ORFEm,2299,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Now, it's true that there are some recent arrivals who missed a court hearing and have already been deported and who they could attempt to focus on. But most of the recent arrivals aren't people who are needing to be newly arrested by ICE. The government doesn't have to go after them and find out who they are and put them in a deportation process because they're already in the process. So if they really went to- But it's a slow process, I think, the Trump administration would say, no? Yes, it's a slow process, and there's not that much they can do about that. The single biggest bottleneck in the removal system is the immigration courts right now. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, there were 735 immigration judges total nationwide, with about 5,000 cases on average, divided between each judge. And the cases can take, on average, if people are applying for some form of relief, anywhere from two years to six years, depending on where in the country they are. And there is not that much that the Trump administration can change about that. They cannot suddenly add hundreds of new immigration judges overnight. The hiring process takes a long time, and Congress has never funded the immigration court anywhere near the level that would be necessary to do that."
85uN5cFm6DH,2764,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And we do expect that this will be a major regulatory agenda. Speed up the timelines for every hearing, limit the number of opportunities people have to find a lawyer, and delay the case so that they can get legal representation, force people to submit applications even more quickly or else see them automatically denied, that's the kind of thing he tried the first time around and will likely attempt to do the second time around. But even that, of course, is going to have its limits, the bigger pool- And he has discretion on that. He doesn't need Congress to change the laws and the processes that much. It depends on what you'd say. So for example, a number of those regulations we argued were violations of the law. The law does allow... The people are required to have their own lawyers. And if the Trump administration puts a regulation in effect that says, ""You have two weeks to get a lawyer, if not, we're going to move forward without it,"" we argued it violated the right to get a lawyer because you have to give people a reasonable time to obtain counsel. So there will be legal challenges over those regulations. And if Congress doesn't pass any changes into law, they will be subject to being tied up in the courts, potentially."
46OC_EijxmK,3131,David Axelrod,"Can the campaigns arrange things, push things so that he takes votes more from the other candidate than from your own candidate? Yeah, I think first of all, general premise, Trump has always gotten around 46%, 47% of the vote. He's never gotten to 50%. My view is that anything that lowers the threshold, in 2016 the combined third party candidates really helped him. Jill Stein of the Green Party who's running again got more votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania than the margin by which Clinton beat Biden. I think in the main these third parties help Trump more than Biden. Kennedy is an interesting case because he's polling around 9% now nationally and in these states. Some of it is the name and nostalgia for the name and some of it is his anti-corporate populism that attracts some potential democratic voters, younger voters. Some of it is conspiracy theory, vaccination stuff that attracts Trump voters. I think that the goal for the Biden campaign and Democrats has to be to leave him only with that group of voters who share the conspiracy theories and who identify more readily with Trump than not. I would target voters on social and in direct communications who are more apt to be for Biden or potential for Biden, but who find Kennedy appealing."
xd0Fo8wxT_E,2444,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"We do targeted operations."" And so he has talked about really what ICE does already, like we saw this week in Bakersfield in California, which was actually a border patrol operation. But that operation, new numbers have come out in the last couple of days. I think that they ended up rounding up 78 people total, 78 arrests. That operation set a ton of fear across that community. It was reported on nationwide and really ended up with fewer than a hundred arrests. And so if enforcement looks more like- And what were they arrested for, overstaying their visas? Unclear from the ways that Border Patrol has talked about it. It seems like it was a targeted operation, but it also seems that they were doing the practice of what's known as collateral arrests at the same time, which is when your targeted operation is, you go to some place, you know where somebody's going to be, or you stake them out, and you grab them when they leave their house or whatever. With collateral arrests, you do that, you stake them out, you grab that person. And then you also ask every person who looks vaguely undocumented, which means every Latino standing around them, and you question them, you ask that person for their papers. And if they're undocumented too, you pick them up also."
9vo_j-XjycQ,8402,Mark Esper,"But a defense company's not going to do that unless they can see a steady stream of revenue coming in based on sales that stretches in the years, 'cause you got to pay that off. And we're just not giving corporate America that degree of predictability and clarity on funding. So we really got to get that fixed because look, if we get into a shooting war with China, we're going to expend a lot of ammunition, a lot of weapons, very, very quickly, and so will they. The difference is they have a very large manufacturing base, the Chinese Communist Party can move on a dime, it can pivot on a dime, and they'll be able to do things I'm afraid more quickly than we can. And then the question is, who can rebuild, refit, rearm real quick and go back at it again? And that's where I get very concerned. So I think we need to build a better, a quicker defense industrial base, we need to start stockpiling arms and ammunition, and we need our allies to do it the same, not just our European allies, but our Indo-Pacific allies as well. Yeah. And I guess the Ukraine war suggests that it's not just, even if we don't get directly into a shooting war, if we're supplying an ally who's fighting an adversary, there too the strains can show up pretty quickly."
69Hz_ezSBuA,5461,Tom Tugendhat,"It works. It just does. And it's perfectly clear to me that when we fight for economic cooperation, for free trade, for the kind of things that we embedded into the early days, very early days, we embedded in an embryonic state into the World Trade Organization. It's absolutely essential for growing freedom. We didn't grow the WTO in order to make Western Europe and the United States and Canada rich. We did it in order to guard our freedom against Soviet encroachment. It was a national security project, the WTO. Initially, I mean, and then it became something else. But in those early days, that's what it was. And I think that we should be looking at economic cooperation in the same way, as ways of extending the bounds of freedom, extending economic liberty as part of personal liberty. And so I think when we look at things like CPTPP or when we look at different forms of ways in which I hope that we are going to be doing trade deals between the United States and the United Kingdom, we shouldn't be looking at it as a sort of zero-sum game. It's not. If we get it right, not only do we both prosper in economic terms, but we both prosper in the sense that we defend our own liberty more deeply."
CaqtITjDrwV,5565,Aaron Friedberg,"I think we know what we're in for on those counts. And all of that would, in my view, would dramatically weaken the United States, both in practical terms and in moral terms. I mean we're already in a bit of trouble on that score. We used to be able to think of ourselves as a beacon of democracy. And we still are in my view, and we're still viewed in that way to some degree by many people around the world, but it's a lot easier for people to say, ""You're in no position to lecture us. Look at how your system is dysfunctional,"" and none of that is going to get better under Trump. It's going to get worse. You haven't said anything about international economic policy, which you've actually have written on very interestingly in terms of dealing with China. Maybe say a word both about what you think we could or should be doing. Do you think the Harris and a Harris administration would go in the direction, which you should explain, that you would like? But also what about the Trump tariffs? I mean, that's a big deal in foreign policy even though it's dealt within the economics departments more than in the political science departments, I guess. Right, right. Well, as far as what we should do, I've written this piece, it was in the last issue of Foreign Affairs , about how to respond to the so-called second China shock, which is this massive outpouring of manufactured goods and the possible damaging implications of that for new industries emerging in advanced industrial countries."
uCunXbr-YcR,2451,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"I've been here for 30 years. This is my home. I own my house. There's many undocumented homeowners. I've been living here. My family is here, my children are here. Their children may be US citizens, or their spouses may be US citizens. And they may say, look, what's going to happen is I'm going to retreat from public life to the extent I can. And we've seen some interviews of undocumented immigrants suggest that's what they're going to do. One person said, ""After he takes office, I'm going to go to work, go to the grocery store, go home, do nothing else."" And you may see a lot of people essentially retreat into their private lives and stop going, or maybe they'll still go to church on Sunday, but really stop going out in the community out of fear. And fear itself, as we've seen with these Bakersfield raids where there was a lot of talk of people not showing up to work, farmers not showing up to their jobs, people not going to school, and the actual numbers, if these reporting is right, was only 78 people. That's a significant number of people, maybe for one particular community, but as a scale that they were not rounding up everybody. But nevertheless, the implications of enforcement operations being carried out in the area made everybody retreat home."
foGXFAGpbk8,7716,AB Stoddard,"So until and unless people stop threatening them in their driveway and on the phone and online, I mean these are real threats to their security if they go against Trump and then they to win their next primary and hold their seats. There's no reason for Susan Collins not to retire. She didn't have to vote for RFK junior. She is going to be in cycle again in '26, and she's going to be 74 and she wants to run until she's 80. She's had a wonderful career of standing up for the right things and bucking her party. She could just retire now and continue to oppose what she thinks is wrong. So that concerns me that they're not going to step back. I want to say another thing about the Democrats. I think it's really important because of what we started with, which is the authoritarian project and how it's structured and how you break down these institutions and centralize your power. They need to start talking about Trump in this third term right now. And he did release an executive order recently, and it doesn't really matter what the terms were, but we can get into that, basically dictating to states how they should make these changes to their electoral systems. The federal government doesn't run elections, states do and localities do."
A31vF2d9wsM,5281,Tim Snyder,"I see a lot of people who I feel like you missed your chance, or you're missing your chance. If you're an anti-fascist, you should go to Kyiv right now and show solidarity. That's what you should be doing, because there's fascism in the world, it's carrying out a genocidal war. Likewise, in the US, a lot of people on the far left take a view of like, ""Well, how do I tell the difference between Biden and Trump?"" I can think of ways you can tell the difference. There are ways in your own tradition where you can tell the difference. But if this whole fascist vocabulary is somehow self- limiting and no one wants to use it? Then I think if you're on... Again, this is not exactly my world. But if you're on the far left and you have a taboo on fascism, or you deny it exists or whatever, then you're going to have a harder time talking about somebody like Trump where there is a cult of personality. Where he's turned the... I'm sorry to say this, but he's turning the Republican Party into a personality party. When it's like you've got people with the same last name as you who are supposed to run it, and it's going to fund you? It becomes then a personal institution like a fascist party."
PyhUpaLLD3B,6769,AB Stoddard,"I do. I do think that there's going to be a real erosion in essential services that you can fire the nuclear guys and rehire them, but what we're looking at particularly with just this week at HHS. HHS is a 13-department agency. I was listening to former HHS secretary, Kathleen Sebelius described this, that they didn't make a plan about their reductions. They have no idea who's under them. They have no idea what these programs do at the state level, the local level, tribal levels. She's described it as a birth to death. A government agency that touches our lives in ways that we're not thinking about and we don't even know. But that clearly the leadership that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And the leadership of HHS doesn't realize. So there will be a rolling backlash to all of this, I believe, and the tariffs are going to put the Republicans in a very difficult position. When he says on the one hand, ""Oh, we're going to basically bail us out of debt because tariffs are going to produce all this revenue,"" but the next day people are getting waivers and exemptions after they've been on the phone with him... You can't use them as a revenue source and then play whack-a-mole with the tariffs, which is what he's done so far."
V6ASZWmnKXe,3276,Doug Sosnik,"And the Trump presidency across almost every single issue was overwhelmingly remembered to be much more positive than the Biden presidency. And so if you fast-forward from the end of October till now, that has been the pattern. It's been a consistent pattern. Now, I would say Trump's support has not really increased in that time, but Biden's support has gone down and they're probably combination of factors. I do believe that the October 7th events and what happened following up in Israel and Gaza, I think has hurt Biden with his base. And I do think there's a general sense that Biden is really not on top of his presidency. His job approval was now in the upper thirties, which is really, really, it's the worst that we've had since Jimmy Carter was president. So, we're now in a phase now going on several months where Trump is a clear, I would say advantage and maybe favorite. We haven't really seen a lot of polling that's come out in the last week since the special council's report. So we'll have to see if Biden's numbers will go down even further. My hunch is because we're in a divided country politically, Trump is still, despite his advantages, he's still at the upper end of his ceiling of around 46 or 47%."
JwQBUPVZ4OE,3304,Doug Sosnik,"What do you say we give a speech there are three roles, that I'm sure your familiar. One is, you got to show up on time. Two is, you don't want to offend your host. And three is, you want to have them feeling better after the speech than before. And I've had a really hard time on that third one. I'm not so great on the second one either, by the way. I've had a really hard time with trying to figure out how you leave people feel a little better after the speech than before. And there are two ways that I do that. One's the positive way that I just described, in terms of where we're headed as a country. And people joke about millennials and generations here, they're actually way more aligned with the greatest generation and sense of communitarianism, and about caring more about community and what their values are. So that's a very positive way, I think, to feel good about the long-term future of the country. And then there's a negative way to feel positive. Which is, despite all our problems, I'd rather have America with our problems, compared to any other country in the world by far. I mean, we have a lot of problems. But, my God, we have strengths which is largely built around our people, and at least up until now around a legal system that's independent."
kWMLkCyRrBp,6526,Jack Goldsmith,"Just the way that when Stansfield Turner under Jimmy Carter became the CIA director and fired 900 human intelligence officers following the Church Commission, which led us to be blind in Iran and Afghanistan and other places. I mean, it had a direct impact. I do think that there's some things that need to be looked at in the FBI. I definitely believe that. And in the whole FISA process, because there have been documented serious problems with that but that's one thing. It's another thing to come in and be a wrecking ball about the kind of guts of how we collect intelligence and use intelligence. Another example is the FISA wall that you'll remember. I won't go into the details. But in another attempt to reform and constrain the use of foreign intelligence, we ended up putting the wall between foreign intelligence and law enforcement that many people think led to 9/11. So the thing I worry about the most is going overboard and getting rid of some of these important laws because they're angry that Carter Page was surveilled and that bad things happened to them. And so this is the thing that I very much worry about in the intelligence community, is not only hollowing out the intelligence community through the structural deregulation I was talking about."
lpNKpln52V4,2545,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"I mean, I'm not talking about even... Totally legal and all, and they're spending money and pulling their hair out about how the whole system works. That's going to be the case unfortunately 2, 3, 4 years from now? Yeah, I mean the last time Congress passed any major changes to immigration law was 1996. They've made a few tweaks here and there. They're likely going to make a few tweaks immediately coming up potentially as soon as the next week or two. But nothing major changes to the system. That said, there are two things to flag. First, should DACA go away? You have half a million people who are extraordinarily sympathetic. That may be an inflection point where Congress gets off of its butt and actually decides to do something. Because it will be a moment and will probably be a specific day that it happens. A court order expires at a certain point. There's a day when everybody who's got DACA loses it, or their protections go away. And that could be the impetus to do something. And then second, if Trump actually does convince people that the border is under control, even if it is maybe somewhat more under control, or maybe it's exactly the same as today, it's just now that he's in charge, he manages to convince people that he's got the job done, then that will take some of the pressure off of those who've repeatedly said, ""I won't do anything on legal immigration and the undocumented population until we fix the border."" And there is some bipartisan support already right now for some answers."
jM3Xg-uqmOM,7705,AB Stoddard,"And there was no future plans for any new protocols or any new treatments for her. And this kind of thing is going to ripple out through people's lives, people who have kids with special needs, people who have diabetes, whatever it is. Like you said, maybe they don't have Parkinson's yet and they don't know how much forward-looking, extremely necessary research and development is going to be scrapped, trials, projects. But we have the people who track measles outbreaks, the people who track salmonella outbreaks and recall the food. I mean, these people are just going to just disappear and this is going to be felt in the next year and it's incredibly, incredibly dangerous. Yeah, no, I'm kind of in more of a state. I'm still most in A state I suppose about the rule of law stuff. I just think it's, but this is very bad too. So it's such a multi-pronged assault. And again, some of it you can't... Rule of law stuff, you can see why Trump wants to do that. This I am slightly mystified by in the sense that why isn't in his political interest to spend more money on fighting cancer? I mean, that's sort of a classic. If you look at the other demagogues and authoritarians, they actually often do spend a fair... they try to be the person who's vaguely in favor of kind of solving these kinds of problems."
nCygAbJF2sI,6515,Larry Summers,"That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that. And we don't have that confidence right now. We are not sure whether court orders will be followed. They might be. I don't think yet we have crossed the Rubicon into complete defiance of the judiciary, but we are sure sidling up to that Rubicon in a big hurry. And that is a very different thing than what we had before. Bill, the stories I hear of people who would've been inclined in various ways to be oppositional, but they weren't sure they could and be 100% confident of their family's safety, these kinds of stories are not what we expect in America. Now, I think it's very important not to have what people have started to call Trump derangement syndrome. I absolutely avoid any analogies with Germany in the 1930s, but I don't think it's necessary to avoid analogies with Argentina in the '40s, '50s and '60s. Argentina was a country where its standard of living in the first half of the 20th century weree in the same broad range as that of the United States."
5bXZHXYh04N,3723,Eric Edelman,"Yeah, probably. Maybe. And would that be a good thing? Yes, that would be a good thing because it'll tie the Saudis closer to us and allow us to have more influence. But will it actually eventuate? We don't know. I think one thing you can say is Boeing and GE seem to have been pretty big winners in all this, contracts both for commercial and military aircraft. So that seems to be a part of this. But overall, if you had to grade it, I would say it's an incomplete because you can't really judge exactly how much of this is going to really happen. And let me ask you about two things that... well, and also the Trump organization and allies like Witkoff presumably got a lot of things, and that's slightly separate issue from what actual publicly owned US companies and the US government got. I do think also one point that didn't get noticed, maybe as much as it could have is there were things given in return. Obviously, no discussion, God forbid, of human rights, of Khashoggi and all that in any of these states. But in the UAE in particular, a pretty major concession, I think-and I would like you to explain it more than I can-of a... not relaxation, I think an end, to restrictions."
8bGbC2igWKS,6526,AB Stoddard,"Half of them voted for the Ukraine aid last year. Trump's selling out Zelensky to Putin. I don't know. There's a constituency for that. So they've slightly paralyzed themselves more than they had to maybe. But maybe that's beginning to change,I don't know. And maybe some entrepreneurial younger Democrats will decide, ""I can make a name for my... I think Booker, I'm sorry to go on so long, but I think Booker really might be a useful wake up call for them. You don't have to get everyone's permission. You don't have to be. I mean, he was well known as he'd run for president and so forth, but you don't have to be a leader of the party to say this stuff. Other people can do their mini versions of it. I'm not thinking particularly here of speaking 25 hours. I'm just thinking of taking an issue and making a big fuss about it. Sanders and AOCs also, I do think there's kind of a moment for a lots of people to be much more entrepreneurial and maybe the example of some of these people going out and doing all this stuff will change the Democrats' tendency to sit around and have another seminar on this and, ""got to get some more polling in on some of this before we say a word."" No, I agree."
M6XcoJa_aBF,8273,A.B. Stoddard,"So, Donald Trump, the Republican Party, you've been a consistent skeptic that the Republican Party could liberate itself from Trump. I think it's fair to say and including when other people thought that was quite likely. Where do you think we stand on Trump in 2024 and Trump and the Republicans? Well, Bill, I mean, as of this time, he is clearly the almost presumed nominee; it's going to be a big mountain to climb for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to try to overcome him. A morning consult poll I saw today has his lead against over DeSantis now biggest ever at 43 points. This is May, what is this? Just to be clear, this is mid-May, May 16th, just so when people look back a year and a half from now, they can give you credit for being way ahead of the curve here in May. Or will be able to say, isn't it great that Ron DeSantis came out of his terrified corner and took Trump on and took him down, and that would be a great thing. But anyway, at this rate, it just seems that Trump is impenetrable, that his support has grown as his legal exposure has increased, and that the contenders around him, like DeSantis, cannot find a way to go after him. And unless they go after him, they can't beat him, and they can't take him out."
YAPD7Pa10Fq,6290,Aaron Friedberg,"And then of course, a few years later, you also have George McGovern who's portrayed, and again, I think there's some reason to believe that this was accurate, as someone who was too risky because he was going to pull America back from its traditional commitments and not just get out of Vietnam but pull out of our alliances. Now whether that was fair or not, those are two candidates who were successfully portrayed by their opponents as risky. But that worked because of the sort of backdrop and the public perception at the time of the nature of the world as being risky but risky in a... How to say it, in a somewhat more stable way that we were locked in this Cold War and it was very dangerous and therefore we didn't want to make radical moves in one direction or another. Now, I'm not sure about the perception. It may be that people see danger here and danger there, but don't see it in a more coherent way. It may be in part as a result of that, that some people are tempted by the belief that if we just sort of pull back from it, we can insulate ourselves from it. So the claim that someone is risky because they're threatening to make radical changes in policy may not work if people don't believe in the threat and therefore don't see the danger of having someone who might do that."
LmpvwI2Il8R,6795,Aaron Friedberg,"And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they've been, in my view, for the most part, the right thing to say. Are those now her genuine convictions and are they strong enough to enable her to push back against what I think is coming her way if she wins, which is we need to stabilize relations with China, we need to get a ceasefire because somehow we're going to get a peace settlement in the Middle East. Or I'm not sure exactly where that would come out on Ukraine. That we don't know, but I think the variance there is much narrower than the variance if it's Trump. And the downside, in my view, is much worse and more dramatic on the Trump side than it is on the Harris side. So if she wins, we'll be back to sort of normal debates about policy, foreign policy, defense policy, and I think we can survive that and live with that. If Trump wins, we're in a whole different world. In my view, it's likely to be a much darker one. Oh, that's good if somewhat bracing thing to end on."
Dlib0Hpho0y,3684,David Axelrod,"Of course, what you're saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this- I don't even.. I'm sorry, go ahead. No, I saw this in the Bush- You were kind enough to point out though the one losing the election campaign, luckily until we had Trump. I just want to credential you. Thank you. Yeah, that's right, but now it was very hard. I mean, George H.W. Bush was proud of a lot of things he had done, but mostly foreign policy, which then became less important after at the end of the Cold War, but also Americans with Disabilities Act and the budget deal and Clean Air Act. It was reasonable for him to be proud of it, and maybe we certainly could have done a better job of explaining it all and defending it, but very hard to get an incumbent president and team, I think, to run a forward-looking campaign. You did that in 2012. You had the advantage of the economy having collapsed on the previous Republican administration, so little- Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much that was of some benefit, but- Not as much- I also have the advantage of a guy who I always say it's, you always look good driving a Maserati. He was very agile."
UvnpKGTUGKi,2521,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So in these sort of targeted operations, generally they do go after people with criminal records. That is their highest priority. They do go after people with the most serious records first, which is part of the reason why the Laken Riley Act is a concern because you would essentially prioritize people with shoplifting arrests over that. But again, setting that aside, I think that's what this targeted operation would look like. So the majority of people targeted would have criminal records. Many of them will have prior deportation orders. They'll be so-called fugitives, and then will also pick up some people just randomly that happen to be sitting around nearby. But the process then is for the immigration court process. Actually, yes, a lot of people who get arrested by ICE or border patrol and put into removal proceedings, then eventually just get released. If they have no criminal record, they get released, go back to living their lives and attend court for however long that process is. When the court proceeding is over, if they lose, then they get deported. And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head."
ET8SboEwHu3,6931,AB Stoddard,"And he turned out to be a man of much more hubris than I believed in '21 and '22. He gives Trump this opportunity. The voters have him -Biden-because of his age. Everyone believes that Ron DeSantis is going to rise up and vanquish Trump. I knew that wouldn't happen. You knew that wouldn't happen. And Trump wins the nomination. And then of course he's on track to win this election, and at that point it was so clear in '23, '24 that if he was given the powers of the presidency again by the voters after he tried to steal an election and overthrow the government, there would be nothing that he wouldn't try absolutely nothing. Did I know how organized it would be by the Heritage Foundation, Russ Vought, current OMB director and the project 2025? No, at that point, I didn't know how specific the plans would be, how shrewd and keen the organization was, but I knew his impulses would be that there would be nothing he wouldn't trample, steal, corrupt take for himself. So the thing that I'll finish with, Bill, is that I am not surprised by the force of what we've seen. I am only surprised by the speed. Interesting. Yeah, I'd say two things and then you're free to comment on one."
yXqp6-DI8Os,5696,Aaron Friedberg,"The North Koreans and the Russians have a deal, the full dimensions of which, I think, we don't fully understand, but seem to involve supplies of conventional munitions from North Korea to Russia, artillery shells, and perhaps also Russian assistance to North Korea, in the further development of its ballistic missiles and its nuclear weapons capabilities. China always, I think, thinks of North Korea as a problem, but also as a state that relies or has relied historically on China, maybe a little concerned that they're striking off and drawing closer to Russia, but that's also a relationship that has significance. On the China-Russia, There have also been accounts just in the last month where U.S. Officials have made comments. They haven't provided a lot of detail, about transfers of Russian technology to China of a sort which includes capabilities that in the past, the Russians have held back, the Crown Jewels or the remaining Crown Jewels of the Russian arsenal. And then the Chinese also helped the Iranians in various ways, including by being the biggest purchaser of Iranian oil, which has been constrained by sanctions. They are supposedly, I believe it's over a million barrels a day through this dark fleet that the Russians or that the Chinese use, so they're not seen to be directly purchasing oil."
1HIYSiKW4Fj,3805,Doug Sosnik,"It was a horrible mass. Robert Kennedy was tragically assassinated, McCarthy, Humphrey, the violence in Chicago, Dick Daley, the whole nightmare, right? Still, at the end of the day, Humphrey almost won in '68, and I believe Humphrey would've ran better in '68 than Lyndon Johnson would have... Sure. ... as the incumbent. Sure. Now, Biden's not Johnson. We don't have the Vietnam war going on. I understand all that, but I think it's so much easier, of course, to see the risk of the unknown, and then to say, ""Look, let's just stick with the known, and we're going to make it through,"" and Democrats may well do it and I frankly would hope they would do it if that's the path they stick on. But I don't know. I'm struck. Maybe just more broadly to let you talk about it. I mean, the convention with Biden and Harris, it's kind of a boring... I mean, how do they make that exciting in August? At least Trump gets to pick a VP in July, right? Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it."
trW79XRI6El,2380,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So the deportation of people picked up by ICE in the interior of the country, not migrants arrested at the border, over the last 15 years, it adds up to about 1.5 million deportations. So they're trying to say that they'll carry out 15 years of deportations in 4 years. I think even that's pretty ambitious. It would take a very significant ramp up of enforcement for them to get anywhere near those numbers. What may happen, however, is that they start the US on a path to eventually getting to very high numbers again, especially if Congress gives them dozens of billions, if not over like a hundred billion dollars for immigration enforcement, which would be a transformative sum of money and could lead to a massive increase in detention centers, capacity, hiring, and personnel, all of which would take multiple years to implement, but would leave the United States with a significantly beefed up enforcement apparatus, really to a level never before seen in US history. So just to be clear, when they pick up these 78 people who were undocumented, I'm just going to make up these numbers, obviously, you can put them in more context to correct them if they're obviously way off, but I don't know, 10 of them have criminal records, let's just say, have been arrested for crimes in the past in the US or something like that, have shown up in databases and so forth."
TYNQXDidddD,6932,Aaron Friedberg,"And that I think would be the most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens. That last sentence is so important. I want to get to it in a second, but I just did a podcast with my colleague, Tim Miller, who made a very good point I hadn't quite focused on, which is we take so much for granted that Trump behaves the way he behaves. I mean, how astonishing is it that he's with the head of a government that's fighting, of a nation that's fighting for its life against the brutal aggressor? We've been with it for, on its side, as almost the whole world has been really, the whole civilized world. And there's not a sentence that I could see, I skimmed the transcript also, of sympathy for Ukraine, of solidarity, of, ""Look, we so admire what you and your citizens have been doing."" You could then say, if you wished, ""We may have to, I'm not sure we can get the maximum war aims that you hope for."" And sometimes he has to make compromises you don't want to make. But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think."
ZFZFony8gEY,2373,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And then second, if Trump actually does convince people that the border is under control, even if it is maybe somewhat more under control, or maybe it's exactly the same as today, it's just now that he's in charge, he manages to convince people that he's got the job done, then that will take some of the pressure off of those who've repeatedly said, ""I won't do anything on legal immigration and the undocumented population until we fix the border."" And there is some bipartisan support already right now for some answers. In the House, and I think soon potentially in the Senate, you have something known as the Dignity Act by Rep Maria Salazar in Florida who's very much a MAGA conservative Cuban, and you have also co-signed with Democrat, Veronica Escobar of El Paso, who's in Beto O'Rourke's old district, both of whom have come together and said, ""Look, let's compromise on this. Let's put something in place that would affect the border, provide more resources there, and also give a path-it's a long and expensive path-to the average undocumented immigrant, but it actually lets them go through something, do what so many people say they should do, get their papers in order, which they can't do today."" And that has been endorsed even by the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus."
xtcX2A_ei0u,6494,Aaron Friedberg,"And judging by what Trump has said, and even more what Vance has said, I think there's every reason to believe that a new Trump administration would at a minimum put enormous pressure on the Ukrainians to come to terms to, and Trump has said this, to accept it's very sad they lost some of their territory, but really they can never get it back and they need to just accept that. Some of the people around Trump who again have been trying to articulate policies that sound more or less coherent, have said, well, what Trump would do is to say to the Russians and the Ukrainians, ""You need to come to terms. And Russia, if you don't, then I'm going to increase support for Ukraine,"" which is kind of laughable because what else is he going to give them? I mean, there may be some things he could give them that we're not giving them, but that just would be inconsistent with everything else that he said, and saying to Ukraine, ""If you don't come to terms, we're going to cut you off."" Well, that's quite plausible, it seems to me, unfortunately. And that I think would be the most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens. That last sentence is so important."
HYy_JV4xxzi,7522,AB Stoddard,"Watching him go after universities, the free press, sort of everything at once, and then you combine Elon, this X factor we didn't expect. A co-president, an outsider, technically an illegal immigrant to this country, come in... the biggest government contractor that we have and just take data if he wants it for his AI company-that he hopes will surpass Sam Altman's, 'cause he hates him-rampaging through, firing people, cutting valuable programs, not leaving a record, not making the case for why it's efficient to cut these things. That was so unexpected. But now that I see it stepping back a bit, I see that it is part of an intentional formula that if you destabilize the populace that rapidly and you could produce that much chaos, you're desensitizing them that much faster to do whatever you want as quickly as you want. So what I thought he would do, which would be give us medium doses of chaos over a certain period of time, definitely create a kleptocracy, definitely corrupt as many institutions and eviscerate as much trust as he could as soon as he could. But what I thought was going to be a more measured schedule... Now I see how effective it is because as soon as you carpet bomb with all of these disruptions and acts of destruction, the sooner the populace is sort of desensitized."
b0RrpiTMF_M,6169,Invisible Rulers,"Certain types of content are illegal in Germany and France, for example, that are legal here in the US. And so platforms have always had to adjust their moderation policy and their content curation regionally to serve particular markets. So Europe is the second largest market. And the European Union passed this thing called the Digital Services Act, and this is a regulation ... You know, Europe's kind of interesting. They pass the theme and then get to the details a little bit later. And so now they have hit this point where there's two big provisions that this law gives that are going to become controversial here in the US. So one is what's called Article 40, and it's the right of researchers to have access to data. If you're a European researcher, and they have some sort of vetting process, and then those researchers are listed-I think journalists and other people can apply also-you have the right to request data access to study a topic that studies content related to systemic risk to the European Union. Nobody really knows what systemic risk means. This is something that we're very uncomfortable with here in the US. They're much more comfortable with that ambiguity in Europe. Anyway, somebody actually requested this. These German researchers requested election data from X related to the upcoming German election."
TVt31Ck-ewQ,3944,Doug Sosnik,"And so there's really not so much of a ballot test on the substantive direction of our country as it is the context of an evenly divided country, largely based on tribal politics in which education is the best predictor. And the question of the personalities of two people that you don't like either one of them and they're running. But if you watch this election in terms of what the policy positions are, it's got very little do with what's going to happen from a governing standpoint in 2025. And the degree to which Trump... so in Georgia in 2022, to just follow up in your example, Herschel Walker was just too unacceptable a candidate. And so he lost, so some Republicans deserted him. Right now, Trump's clearly ahead in Georgia, I think. And so now for me, it's a little crazy to say, believe me, I would not have voted Herschel Walker either. But it's a little crazy to say that Herschel Walker is more dangerous to the country as one senator out of 100 than Donald Trump as President of the United States, who's going to pull out of NATO and all these other things. And staged a coup, and we won't even go into it, but that's not quite where these swing voters are right now."
wAHxPcEJC8x,7312,A.B. Stoddard,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined today by A.B. Stoddard, with whom I had an excellent conversation about 10 months ago. And we're going to pick up on some of those themes today. A.B. has had a distinguished career as both a reporter and a commentator. You can find her work at RealClearPolitics and occasionally, it should be even a little more occasionally at The Bulwark , with some really excellent pieces there. And I think really one of A.B's great virtues is that she's both a serious reporter, a real reporter, does interviews, has sources, and a very thoughtful commentator. And most people are sort of one or the other, but A.B. is both. So, A.B, thanks for joining me again. Thanks for having me again, Bill. It's an honor and a pleasure. Well, it's great. The previous conversation, which was in July, 2022 stands up well, and we discussed Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, and Congress. And let's just go through those three topics today and see what's changed and what we have to say since July, but also since the election. So, Donald Trump, the Republican Party, you've been a consistent skeptic that the Republican Party could liberate itself from Trump. I think it's fair to say and including when other people thought that was quite likely."
3Bk5woFMt3i,5445,Aaron Friedberg,"And the question from my side was, to what extent are we going to succeed in building a functioning coalition of democracies, global coalition, that would include our allies in Europe and in Asia cooperating with us and working together jointly to deal with this growing threat, which is emerging from the center of Eurasia, if you like, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. They are all cooperating with each other in different ways. And it appears that that cooperation has grown more and more sophisticated and complex. China is clearly doing a lot to help the Russians, as far as we know, they're doing everything but selling them large quantities of armaments, maybe there've been some small shipments of arms in the past, there've been some reports of that. But they're, of course, major provider of all the components, electronic, mechanical, that the Russians need to build and rebuild some of their sophisticated capabilities. So China is helping Russia. The Iranians are helping the Russians by selling them drones in large quantities. And that's where they've been getting a lot of the equipment that they've been using against Ukraine. The North Koreans and the Russians have a deal, the full dimensions of which, I think, we don't fully understand, but seem to involve supplies of conventional munitions from North Korea to Russia, artillery shells, and perhaps also Russian assistance to North Korea, in the further development of its ballistic missiles and its nuclear weapons capabilities."
JFN20M7gtgK,7019,Robert Kagan,"Sohrab Ahmari, yeah. Yeah, yeah, has written a lonely piece saying, ""Why are we so opposed to China? Don't they have the kind of moral system that we would like to have in the United States?"" You know what I mean? You could say China is communist, but in many respects, China is also just a traditional authoritarian regime that is also suppressing what a lot of people in America right would call excessive liberalism, et cetera. I agree with you. Other than the utility of the fact that there's a communist party in charge, I don't know why they should be opposed to China any more than they're opposed to Russia. I think Bolton says that Trump said to Xi in private, ""That's good what you're doing with the Uyghurs. I mean, why should you have these problematic Muslim characters causing trouble for you in part of your empire or your nation?"" Final thoughts, anti-liberalism. I'm curious, the book's been out, which we're speaking on just, what is it, Tuesday, May 7th? I mean, you've been talking about the book for about a week. A week. Anything surprising in the reaction? People more hostile, less hostile, more open? I don't know, surprised, not surprised? Well, I think I've been on pretty friendly media so far, so it's hard to..."
tdF7r25730v,7625,James Carville,"Young voters, yes, under 30. They gave them 15 issues and number 14 and number 15 was student loans and Gaza. I forget what order they came in, but there was so few people, it's not even worth worrying about, which of course completely disrupts the view. Now, forget the campus protests of whoever they are, if they even go to college, but there is a general unease among people about what's happening in Gaza. That's undeniable. And it's not just Rashida Tlaib or my favorite, the meal plan revolutionary. Yeah, there was that. ""If we don't have our mac and cheese, we're not going to have a revolution,"" oh, okay. But yeah, it's just overall discomfort, like, did they really have to do that? And it's creating a world of confusion in foreign policy, obviously. Even allies are starting to get really... they've got Ireland, I guess Spain and Norway recognized Palestine, something like that. You can feel where this thing is going and it's not in a great direction. And I do think that whatever the right policy is or whatever need there might be for change in policy, the extent to which the Biden administration allows itself to look as if it's being dragged along towards these changes... this is very true of Ukraine policy too, I think... as opposed to sort of saying, ""Okay, now we're doing this."" I mean, Reagan made some pretty terrible decisions."
Kg2SaJiYvU1,3892,Eric Edelman,"It started out more as a potential state-to-state transaction because of Trump's impatience to get a new aircraft as Air Force One. And the Qataris have been trying to unload a specially built 747 that they have for VIP travel for the emir, which is very expensive to operate. They've They unloaded one actually, according to The New York Times , as a gift to Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, because of Turkey's role standing by Qatar in its short-lived sort of embargo with Saudi Arabia and the UAE back in 2017. And they gave one away, they're trying to unload the other. And although initially they thought they would be leasing it or selling it to the United States government, somehow this morphed into it's going to be a gift to either Trump personally or actually to the government, but then it's going to go to Trump's library. It's all a little bit of a mystery how it morphed into this. But as Susan Glasser wrote, it's the perfect symbol for the trip because he has no doctrine. He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document."
BILkssjcY6z,5277,Tim Snyder,"So that's infinitely more than I had. But I think it's a real... that's not a happy revelation, but it's one that one should've of course known all along, I guess. Yeah. It's interesting that we dropped it in the US because the whole anti... In the '80s we got ourselves... I'm just looking at this back... in the '80s I was a teenager, so I'm not making an intellectual history point, but I think in the '80s, with Reagan, the anti-totalitarians got themselves all focused on communism. Whereas originally the anti-totalitarian position, the Cold War liberal position which then bled into the neo-comm position. But originally that position was an anti-totalitarian position and not an anti-communist position. But as time went by and as domestic politics changed, it kind of morphed into this anti-communism position and the anti-fascist pit was in the background. But I think that snuck up on us. And it's not just an intellectual history problem, it's also that because... we didn't think about how fascism always arises at home. If you're just going to be an anti-communist, that means, okay, then the enemy's on the left or it's across the ocean or whatever. And you don't think, okay, well, here I am a conservative. Let me look to the right and just make sure that there's not anything over there dangerous which is going on."
Ip9lSe_b1-B,7839,A.B. Stoddard,"This is where that CNN Town Hall let's just do a final before we get to President Biden, who's important. This is, of course, typical of the Biden years, you spend the first half hour of the conversation on Trump, Right. But why not? He's been the dominant figure in American politics for eight years. It's really astonishing. But anyway, what was I going to say about that? The CNN Town Hall, I don't know, maybe it just comes and goes, but it feels like a significant moment where he went on CNN, he did what they said he wouldn't do, confronts, a tough questioner in a somewhat fake but still town hall setting, only with Republicans or Republican-leaning independents who two-thirds of whom were pro- Trump presumably, and certainly showed they were, but still, it gives him a good talking point for the foreseeable future about, and for voters it's like he took them on, that's the Trump we know. Look at him. He's not scared of them. It most definitely energized his supporters just so much. And that's probably what led to the bump in the Morning Consult poll, the new one. And I think that a lot of Republicans who want to move beyond him, like Mark Thiessen at The Post and stuff are saying, ""that was a Biden commercial."" I don't think it was."
oIQH4Hm3INH,8869,James Carville,"This is the dumbest thing that you can imagine."" And I'll give myself credit. I was right. I call ""defund the police"" the three stupidest words in the history of the English language. And of course no one's talking about it now. And that just everything that they touch turns to garbage. And I think people have caught onto them. And people say, ""James, you say some controversial stuff."" I said, ""It's not controversial if 90% of the people agree with you. That's not. It's controversial when 51% agree with you."" Yeah, because... Go ahead. I know you said it to me in our first conversation, which was 2021, I think at the Amherst faculty lounge and all that, and people were all, gee, I could do something Amherst faculty Lounge in the English professors at Amherst. That was terrible of you to do that, James. I thought it was actually a pretty good- It was good. Pretty good way to drive it across. Does she have to almost explicitly say, ""Look, I said these things in 2019."" Absolutely. ""But I've learned in three and a half years in the White House... "" Does she have to almost explicitly walk away from some of them? Absolutely. And you live and you learn. I've learned. I've seen how global conflicts work."
lmMUTU1P0U8,7222,A.B. Stoddard,"And so it's so interesting- And that Biden was a good leader because they did pretty well. And it looked great for Biden. It looked great for Biden. He defied history. And so they carried on in a united front. And again, as you and I said, another opportunity to say, ""I'm going to be a great one-term president, and the midterms is another accomplishment,"" but still walk away. But he dawdled. It was going to be after Christmas, then after the State of the Union, and then he goes all in. The midterms were no excuse for him to run. It's no mandate for him to run. But another thing I think the people around him tell him is another one of his strengths, that he's always underestimated, that the middle of the country understands him, that the Democratic candidates running in the most tough races were able to decouple and distance themselves from him, that he is not toxic, that Americans don't energize against him. And that all can be true, and you can still be too old to run again. You talked to so many members of Congress and staff, but really members mostly, privately and sometimes off the record or in the background. I'm just curious, on both the Republican and Democratic side, how discomforted are most of the Republicans with the prospect of Trump?"
6TRpoUymr-m,5159,Larry Summers,"So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place. Second thing I would say is... There's a saying that it takes 30 years to grow a forest and 30 minutes to burn it down. Credibility is a little bit like that. And once you lose credibility, once you do one highly erratic thing, nobody can know about the next kind of erratic thing. And by the way, even if we are completely calm and stable, the nature of the reactions to this in the rest of the system may take time to play out. So I think the level of uncertainty is much greater and uncertainty encourages standing still, and when everybody tries to stand still, there's not much forward motion and the risk of economic downturn increases. I think the third thing is something you also said, which is in almost every area, policy is erratic, authoritarian and confidence-threatening. I think it's an extraordinary thing that the number of flights booked by Canadians to come to the United States is down by 70%. You and I, Bill, are used to the idea that going to visit certain countries, prudent people carry burner phones so that their phone will not be downloaded with its content."
6IO_CeSl2At,2140,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"There are still about 250,000 or more migrants waiting in Mexico. Many of them are registered through the CBP One app, attempting to seek legal entry through a port of entry. And the Biden administration's carrot and stick policies seem to have shifted some behavior. What's more, the number of people coming through Panama's Darien gap from South America plummeted in December, dropping from about 25,000 in October to about 5,000 in December. So number of migrants coming to Mexico to seek entry has already slowed, possibly because people are taking a wait and see approach to the new administration. Interesting. Okay, but those numbers can go back up slowly, and it is interesting how much Biden's crackdown, I guess you'd call it, in the summer of 2024 really affected numbers, right? I'm just struck by that. Yeah, the Biden crackdown as well as Mexico's crackdown. So Mexico's crackdown had the lion's share of the impact, about 50% drop after Mexico began this. What Mexico is doing, to be clear, is something that's been called the merry-go-round. Migrants are essentially trapped in southern Mexico. Any migrant who's caught outside of the state of Chiapas is arrested, rounded up, and sent back to Chiapas in southern Mexico. So you have migrants traveling north, being arrested and found at a checkpoint, sent south."
ez5x9ZXD5jw,5765,Tom Tugendhat,"But at the same time, let's not forget 15, 20 years ago, Germany would've offered no support to anyone at all. So this is a change. Is it as much of a change as I'd like to see? No, but it's a movement. And I hope this means that Germany is being more realistic about the threats they face. It's interesting, actually, I mean, I'm purely, and forgive me this as a politician, on a purely political point, how the German Green party has been one of the leading advocates of this because of their commitment to human rights, and how a lot of the defense of Ukraine has come out of Germany's very, very long tradition now of very strong defensive human rights. And I think that's a very positive thing to see. Well, on that note, I was going to get to this at the end, but I'll raise it now since you broadened the discussion here in a very good way and a interesting way, I think. Am I crazy to think that this could be a moment where a kind of Cold War, center-left, center-right coalition accepting our responsibilities for leadership on behalf of liberal democracy around the world and certainly against brutal aggression against liberal democracies, however much fostering it in other countries is slightly a different question, but am I crazy to think that this could be a moment that we'll look back on as a kind of 1948, '49, '50 type moment where the old coalition comes back together or a new coalition partly comes together to deal with the threats in a kind of clear-eyed way and principled way?"
0tb1jouNoyc,3751,Doug Sosnik,"And you can see the Biden White House is very concerned to put him out in non-controlled environments. They didn't do the Super Bowl interview. So I think a lot of it for Biden, I can tell you stories you want about the Reagan White House, but I think for Biden, a lot of it is going to be just turn the sound off and watch him on TV and see how he looks. And if you got a problem with how he looks, that's going to be a big problem in terms of trying to manage his age problem. The Super Bowl interview thing kind of freaked me out a little, and I wrote this little piece on Monday which suggested he might still step aside, it's a little late, quite late, but that the primary process would still be better produced, likely a stronger candidate. I obviously could be wrong, and this may most likely will never be tested, I suppose, but the Super Bowl interview you mentioned earlier, people- you know, fragmented viewing, people less engaged in politics and fragmented political obviously universe. The one thing, Super Bowl did have the highest ratings ever, and that was predictable that it was going to have very high ratings. And people are happy when they're watching the Super Bowl generally, I think, and maybe they're worried about their own team if they're in San Francisco or Kansas City, but otherwise it's a spectacle, you get together."
I0uLyReOPg_,7317,Robert Kagan,"The interesting thing about that is that that was an increase in antisemitism following the great immigration influx of the 1890s. Antisemitism was not a big part of 19th century America, but it became a big part of 20th century America as, again, the white Anglo- Saxon Protestant, still majority in America at that time was getting very nervous about what it meant to be an American, and really set out to define more clearly what it meant to be an American. And that led to the exclusion of Jews in a way that they had not been previously excluded. And it led to all this sort of hierarchy of races, et cetera. This was not something that they had inherited. It was something that was introduced in that period. Again, just to emphasize, it's not impossible for it to be reintroduced in a country that had seemingly moved beyond it. When you have whites in this sort of state of panic that I think many whites are in today. Well that's such an important point to kind of, I don't know what you call it, zigzag. I mean it's not in a straight line, it's not even, this is the more moderate version of the triumphal liberalism thesis that it is not a straight line, we're grown-ups, we know that there can be setbacks and reverses and reactions, but ultimately, ultimately history goes in this direction."
xPBKlYvxLkH,17498,Anne Applebaum,"You've covered it so closely. You've been there several times. You wrote about it this morning in The Atlantic . Just say a few words about what we should be thinking about on this day. I think everyone should think back on how they felt at the time of the invasion. I was supposed to go to Kiev that week, and I didn't go because all the planes stopped flying a couple of days before the attack. And I was back in Washington, and I wound up staying up all night and watching it on television, and I was convinced that Kiev would fall. I was terrified for people that I know. And then we watched it turn around and it turned around, as I said, because of real bravery, because Ukrainians could do clever things with less weapons, because the Russian army was totally unprepared, because Putin didn't understand that there is such a thing as a Ukrainian nation, and it did want to defend itself, and it wasn't a fake creation of the United States or whatever Putin believed. I think back on that and think where we are now and we now have this enormous Ukrainian army, and Ukraine has links and contacts all over the world and allies all over the planet and friends inside the United States and Europe."
JmJbMMdxYYf,9060,Mark Esper,"But you don't go so far as to threaten to undermine NATO or to pull out, things like that. So again, I think in many cases his instincts were right. There were accomplishments during that administration, but there were guard rails in place, guard rail number one being the prospect of reelection, and number two being the people he brought in around him. Some of those guard rails won't be there in number two. So will we get traditional Republican foreign policies or will we get a distorted version of that in the second going? I'll let you go. I know you have a plane to catch. I think that second guard rail was more important versus than the first. The reelection thing, you could tell him stuff and maybe some of these things would be popular getting out of Afghanistan. You don't give yourself and your colleagues enough credit for stopping some of these things. Then particularly not just some bad foreign policy decisions, but the really crucial non-politicization of the military and non-misuse of the military, which again, some of that's beneath the surface, but became pretty obvious once you left the Pentagon the kinds of things that could happen. The people who succeeded you had been there for a year, not for two months. Right. Right? What does that look like?"
6BVP1h8MQE3,3211,David Axelrod,"I would target voters on social and in direct communications who are more apt to be for Biden or potential for Biden, but who find Kennedy appealing. I would try and peel them away and leave the rest for Trump. Leave the rest Trump voters with Kennedy. Maybe push some of the Trump voters to Kennedy. I always love the way these discussions are sort of silly sometimes because it's sort of who's voting for Kennedy? What's the split of Biden and Trump supporters as if people don't have agency and the ability to push one message or another about Kennedy? Well, I think- The group could put up, I'm just making this up, $50 million of ads showing Trump with Fauci, Trump boasting about how he's going to vaccinate everyone, which he did some of obviously in 2020, defending his own fast tracking of the vaccine. It's probably one of the decent things he did as president and say, ""Look, Trump's not really against vaccines. Only Kennedy is."" Now obviously that would be a somewhat dirty, not really dirty trick, but- No, it's not. It's true. It's true. I mean if 3% of Trump supporters say, ""Oh my God, I didn't realize he was such a vaccine guy. I am for Kennedy,"" why isn't that a good idea? The danger of course if you do that, you have to be really careful with that because you could also normalize him for people who are on the fence and say, ""Well."" That's right."
OP43_hLRjOt,3917,David Axelrod,"It's kind of stable, but very much on the margin."" Then, you look at all the things that are so unusual and so crazy, 77 year old and 81 year old, legal cases- Two incumbents. ...Dissatisfaction with both nominees, the world and a fair amount of chaos and could be much better, could be much worse. I sort of think, I don't know, it might be the opposite of stable and predictable. Anybody who makes forecasts- I feel like it's both things can't be true, that it's stable and predictable and totally unstable and unpredictable. I don't know. Forecasts are for fools right here. I mean I think you can maybe say who would win today. I think anybody who says they know who's going to win in November is foolish because there are too many imponderables. We mentioned the trials with Trump. Obviously, we're relying on the notion that Biden is going to be hale and hearty from now until November. A slip and fall or something like that could have an impact. There are a lot of variables here. The one thing I think you can predict is it's going to be close one way or the other. Beyond that, I would not venture. We'll get back together maybe after the conventions or maybe- I'm not sure a lot of what I said makes sense."
T5d3vS9L_X6,7471,AB Stoddard,"That's why we have to have tariffs, whatever. I don't believe in the end that Trump is on board for enacting deep Medicaid cuts and really eviscerating social security, but I believe that he believes that Elon is very helpful to him. And so if there are a few broken bodies, a few burned out cars on this rampage, oh, well, it'll all just get cleaned up later. And he continues to do that propaganda stuff, which is, oh, there's so much bloat in the government. We had to do this. I mean, there'll be a few hardships, but we got to clean this up. And as far as the rule of law, I really truly did... Anyway, so I don't believe in the end he's on board for entitlement reform and I think that will be an issue down the road, but right now people are trying to all sing from the same hymn book. As for the rule of law, I did expect the Justice Department to be this corrupted immediately and to use it as a show of force and dominance and to try to scare people that he wouldn't even be subtle about it. I expect 5:00 AM raids with 20 cop cars outside the houses of people I won't name. Once they can pull together a ""case"" against them."
S8ZnKbJEhqF,13596,Anne Applebaum,"That's the problem. Right. And you can't flip a switch and have the munitions capabilities and so forth. I mean, there's some elements to the war that I think people don't really understand. So the war is- Let me just come back to the Europe thing, one thing, just to clarify something. I'm very struck when you say it's very important, just I want to put a pin in this, that there is this coalition of the willing, and I expect you to say, and you said the Scandinavians, the Balts, Poland, Czech Republic, probably some others. And then you said pretty matter-of-factly, ""and Germany and France and the UK."" I mean, I think three years ago, we would've said before the war, I suppose, it's not obvious that Germany in particular would be part of a coalition of the willing against Russia. Germany had done a lot to be a major trading partner of Russia, and of course there was the energy issues and so forth. UK had sort of left Europe foolishly in 2016 or left the EU. And France, France is always a bit of a wild card. I'm just struck, and I'm not quarreling, I'm just saying explain a little more, or maybe I'm wrong to be surprised by this, but I guess I'm struck that you're fairly confident that Europe as a whole sees letting Putin win in Ukraine as unacceptable."
P_CNz0EALma,5859,Tim Snyder,"Yeah, that's it. So interesting. I want to get back to us being the weak link, which I mean is a terrible thing as an American, I've got to say, to acknowledge. But it's true, I think for now. But have you been surprised, I mean, you're a student of, and I think mostly an admirer of modern or current Ukraine or current being even a couple of three, four or five years ago. But have you been surprised by just the performance of their- the country, the system, the government, the civil society? It seems pretty impressive and awfully admirable, but- I was one of... This question is a little awkward. It's awkward when you're right. It's not awkward when you're wrong in American public because when you're wrong, everybody just forgets it. Right? Well, I'll put it in a better way then. I guess knowing much less sort of was pleasantly surprised. So tell me why, explain what was happening in Ukraine that people like me didn't fully grasp. Yeah, I publicly said Zelensky is going to stay and they're going to fight. And that basically got laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay and they were going to fight. I didn't think they would do as well as they ended up doing."
zwQX1rlGNyq,5691,Jack Goldsmith,"And the president delegates that to the attorney general who delegates that to the Office of Legal Counsel. And that means on all of the hard questions that are going to come up, is the Federal Advisory Committee Act constitutional? Can the president impound these funds? Does the Vacancies Act work here to allow you to put in this official? Again, these sound weedy, but they're just so vital to the actual running of the government. The person in the Office of Legal Counsel is going to be deciding those in the first instance. And different administrations have different models and that's a tough job because you're on the president's team. I tried to describe this in The Terror Presidency . You're on the president's team, but you're not there to be a yes person. And that tension, as you were calling it, is hugely important that that person have the capacity to say, ""No, you really can't do this. It just crosses a line."" This is normal in government, by the way. OLC says no all the time. You don't see it as much because they don't write opinions about when they say no. This is normal in government or not no but, ""No, you can't do it this way but try it that way."" That position is going to be absolutely important."
6X4t7kj2dnL,3443,Eric Edelman,"I think there are a lot of Republicans in the Senate in particular, but also some in the House, who have been very hawkish on Iran, who are very nervous about what kind of agreement might come out of this, and whether there's some kind of, in Witkoff's phrase, elegant solution to this that involves either some suspension of enrichment during the Trump administration's term, but allows them to restart later, or whether they're allowed to have some low-level enrichment, but will have to export out the [Low Enrichment Uranium] to some other place. There are a lot of different permutations and combinations of all this. But I think for those of us who worry about nuclear proliferation, the idea of allowing Iran to continue to have a robust industrial scale nuclear enrichment capability, uranium enrichment capability, is very worrisome from a proliferation point of view. And worrisome to Israel, I would guess. Another country in the region that came up tangentially during the trip. He didn't choose to go to Israel, and for whatever reason seems to be... I guess Vance, Vice President Vance, just seems to have canceled a, not officially announced but planned, trip to Israel out of unhappiness with what Israel is doing in Gaza. Maybe also general tensions with the Israeli government. I'm pretty struck that for a guy, for a ticket that campaigned a's very much in sync with pro-Israel hawks, and people like me, if I could say, who were traditionally pretty pro-Israel, getting beat up by all of our various friends or ex-friends and acquaintances about, ""How could he possibly support Biden and Harris, and that Trump's so much better on Israel."" He doesn't seem like..."
Rpy6Fie3kCU,4919,Tom Tugendhat,"They're making sure they've got the supplies in. I mean, Russia is still playing. But the gas supply, as you know, Nord Stream 1, that gas pipeline that connects Russia to Germany is apparently going through another few days of maintenance, which seems realistically to be an excuse for Russia to sort of play with the gas supply. And yes, of course there's more that the United States can do, but let's not pretend the United States is doing nothing. The United States is doing a lot. I hope very much that you'll supply more gas, particularly in liquefied natural gas, which you have done in the past. You need a bit more capacity from your terminals, but I hope you'll be able to grow that. And countries like Canada I hope will be a very, very important part of the energy mix in years going forward, because we've got to make sure that we work together. If you like, this is one of those moments where we've just realized that for 70, 80 years, we were going towards a sort of greater globalization. But the reality is, the nation state is back. And the nation state is back in ways that I don't think we, or other, not everybody expected. And nation states need to recognize the reality that this has implications for all of us."
V9UAGWblQdR,6577,Invisible Rulers,"And that phrase that Elon uses, ""We are the media now,"" that came out of QAnon, just to be clear. And I'm not saying that it's a conspiratorial... I'm not saying that to connect him to QAnon in some sort of woo, conspiracy theory. No, I'm saying it because it comes out of this sense that we can collectively assemble and have power and change the world. And that is the attitude of people who get deeply into factional, social media politics. And I say it as somebody who really, deeply understands it, because I did it too. And it's because it's fun, and it's engaging, and it gives you a sense of meaning and a sense of belonging, and it gives you a sense of mission. And it is how every single important political battle is going to be fought from here on out, because it leverages an entire organic army of people. The same time I was doing the vaccine thing, Gamergate was happening. And then the Trump, MAGA, 3X, Pepe crowd was doing their thing. And it was just watching these... It's not like a top-down, coordinated thing. It's a bottom up, organic, improvisational process. And I think that people who are institutionalists and are inherently... And I am one, we need institutions for society. But you also have to understand that this dynamic, it's much more of an insurgent type of dynamic than a controlled brigade force, if you will."
e5agNy8NS7_,6658,Tom Tugendhat,"I mean, I'm not close enough to the frontline and close enough to the military elements to comment on it, I'm afraid. And you'll forgive me as a former professional soldier, I know how easy it is to get false impressions from TV reports or from reported gossip. So I'm not going to comment on that, because I just don't know. All I can say is it's clearly well prepared. I can say that because it's got many fronts and they seem to be coordinating effectively at this point. But again, as I say, I'm not there, so I don't know. But look, let's hope, right? I mean, the faster this war is over, not only the more Ukrainian lives are saved, but actually the more Russian lives too. So both sides should want this war over as quickly as possible. And now that the Ukrainians have demonstrated that the war will not be over by them surrendering, they've made that extremely clear, there is only one other alternative. Yeah, victory, right? So what about us, what about you and the UK and the US and the West in general, are we doing all that we could and should doing, most of what we could and should be doing, both militarily? And then we can get to some of the economic questions as well."
ukJx5jPQMyv,5061,Larry Summers,"And as you say, tariffs go from 1.5% to 2.5% or something, not tenfold or even fivefold. And I do think the universities have been useful. The collective action thing-you and I have gone through this in other spheres too-it's both true and an excuse, right? As the universities have proven, in a society like ours, it's an overcomeable problem. And as I was joking, with the law firms, someone was explaining it's very hard for them. It's like if only there were a trade association of all these lawyers that already existed, or if only there were the Business Roundtable, as you say, that already existed. This is one of the great things about America is we have all these associations. One of the things they do is overcome collective action problems, you would think. At the end of the day, and you've exhibited this, I believe, in your public career, some people just need to lead at some point though, there needs to be real civic and political leadership, right? The markets don't do it entirely anonymously. No, absolutely. I do really think that it is important though to understand that it really is better if you're unhealthy because you're eating a gallon of chocolate ice cream every day, then you're unhealthy despite having a terrific diet. No, no."
Gj15oAyYqKD,7177,James Carville,"It's what I like about politics. We're kind of like track athletes. We all kind of hang out together and get to know each other and that kind of stuff. But we still- It's been a pleasure for me- -want to win. Yeah, a pleasure for me too, but let's win. I think that would be good too. Absolutely. Yes, sir. That's right. Make it even more of a pleasure. Thank you, Bill. James Carville. James, thank you for joining me and thank you all for joining us on Conversations. Thank you. Thank you."
efFpwOxgkDv,5618,Tim Snyder,"Russia has more people, but also Russia, the Russian leadership doesn't care at all about losing its own people, whereas Ukrainian leadership to its great credit, does care. They have to balance preserving territory, winning the war and not losing too many people on the battlefield. But I think they've been very clever about things that look asymmetric like these sea drones. They've been very clever about how they fought the war so far. And again, so I think so long as we subjectively act as though they can win the war, I think they can eventually win the war. And I mean, to be clear by winning the war, I don't mean that they're going to drive out every Russian soldier off every square centimeter of Ukrainian territory. It's that I think a system like the Ukrainian one actually has more staying power than a system like the Putinist one. And war ends when politics buckles, it ends when one side or other can't sustain it any longer. And I think if the Ukrainians have support, the weaker side in the end is going to be the Russian side. Yeah, that's it. So interesting. I want to get back to us being the weak link, which I mean is a terrible thing as an American, I've got to say, to acknowledge."
pXLV2nVyFde,6486,Invisible Rulers,"Well, conspiracy theorists will talk all day long, because they're in there digesting the ""Q drop."" And so they're in there trying to figure out where the pedophiles are, where the children are, or whatever. And these are incredibly active groups, so there's no ethical question there. There's no question about is it good to recruit people into digital cults? That's not the question they're asking at the time. ISIS is kind of clearly a no-no, but some of these other things were not. And you start to see the ethical questions, they get thornier, right? I feel like QAnon is the easy one. Before we get to the ethical question, I mean, just on the empirical side, so to speak, this does seem to be very important. It's very interesting. I mean, if the algorithm... I'm going to say this in a stupid way, but you'll understand. It's smart enough to understand that if you like this conspiracy in this area, you might like other conspiracies in another area. That has always been true presumably psychologically. I've got to stipulate for human beings. RENÉE DIRESTA: Yes. But in the old days, if you were a conspiracy theorist about X, you wouldn't necessarily have entree, so to speak, or be forced into knowledge, even, of a conspiracy theory Y, right?"
E7-HtA6qmtN,3158,Eric Edelman,"And we're going to do away with all that which allows, however imperfectly because it hasn't been perfect and there have been all sorts of problems with the system and the outcomes have not always been great, but at least it allows for a deliberate consideration of pros and cons of policy and what the potential advantages or disadvantages that we have vis-a-vis our adversaries and how we might coordinate and consult with our allies. There's no guarantee that if you have a good process, you're going to have a good policy outcome because the world is a very complex, difficult place and you can never really predict how policy is going to play out. But I can tell you that if you have a bad policy process the odds of getting a bad outcome go up dramatically. So the notion that we're facing this incredibly complex world- we haven't even touched on some other things like tensions between India and Pakistan, two nuclear powers that could get to the point of having a nuclear exchange that would be catastrophic for the world. And we just seem to be very passive. I mean, the President took a lot of credit for the stand-down that India and Pakistan reached, claiming that the phone calls that Vance and Rubio and others made were key to this, although the Indians have denied that."
OqryDWYqr98,5159,Aaron Friedberg,"And then on the other side, you have the Democrats, Harris, and I think the question about Harris might be, is Harris going to be Biden 2.0 or is it going to be Obama 2.0? To me, that's sort of the range of variation, and that's much narrower. And obviously there would be differences between either type of Trump administration and either type of Harris administration, but the differences between those two notional forms of a Harris administration are much, much narrower and much more, I don't know, much more traditional and familiar. And so the widest gap would be suppose that you got a much more left- leaning Harris foreign policy and a much more right-leaning Trump foreign policy. And both are possible, although I think it's less likely in fact that Harris is going to go in some dramatically different direction than the direction that Biden has been following. But the array of possibilities is quite wide. And it seems to me, correct me if I'm wrong on this, on both China and the Middle East, you could argue they end up maybe not so wildly different from each other, the two Democratic, let's just say Democratic and Republican administration, Trump and Harris. Whichever version of Harris you get, and to some degree, whichever version of Trump we get, I do think on Russia-Ukraine, it just seems pretty much more black and white."
5SOK4ClDJzh,6269,Jack Goldsmith,"And from both, including their own party to some degree. Yeah. Yes. The Republicans and Democrats don't always agree, especially on the intelligence committees. There's more of a divide there in my sense than on the Armed Services committees, but I think they still have pretty good relationships across the aisle there even when they disagree. And again, my experience with those committees has been that they're moderately well-functioning. Now, not everybody would agree with me on that, but that's my experience. This will be an ongoing drama over four years, but a final question maybe. I mean, this is maybe stupid, but when should we have another conversation and you'll be able to say with some assurance where on the spectrum things are shaking out in some of these different areas, or will it just be an ongoing zigging and zagging and so forth? I'll give a two-part answer. I mean, I think we'll know a lot after these confirmation hearings and in the first three months. These nominees are going to be asked a lot of questions. They're going to be pinned down on their views, and it'll be interesting to see if... I actually expect this to happen. I expect Pam Bondi to say, as Trump just said, that she's going to be independent and that of course, the president has the constitutional authority to order her to do whatever he wants, as he reminded us, and he does."
6qCRA8ABW0-,9299,James Carville,"And I did. I didn't think it was a way... At the end of the day when he snapped at Jason Crowe, I knew it was... And I said, ""That's not who he is."" And Jason Crow is... if there's anything that modern Democratic Party ought to be about, it should be Jason Crow. Right. He's a prototype of what a modern Democrat should be. And I just think Biden was tired, older, cranky, and it was just a sign that he was going to eventually come around. Yeah, no, you were right. You told me, I remember, during the period that sort of the Herb Stein thing, what can't continue won't continue. I mean, I feel like that you always had more confidence that it would have to work itself out. It might take two or three weeks, which it did, but it did. So let's assume that the Trump campaign got blindsided a little. I don't know, Trump himself seems a little rattled actually. I think by running against Harris, he really had internalized the notion he was going to get to beat up Biden and be the challenger against the incumbent for a long time. What now though? As you say, LaCivita and Susie, Wiles and Fabrizio know what they're doing. They're presumably trying to adjust. Maybe Trump can adjust."
-sKavmlo57D,3980,Doug Sosnik,"I think it's true for Republicans, I know it's true for Democrats, which the last time that the convention served that purpose of nominating someone based on who's on the convention floor was '68. Yeah, that's an unfortunate memory for Democrats. Yeah, and so that was such a disastrous- But let me make this, can I just- So I read this little piece, and I said, it's funny that the convention was in Chicago, because you know what? The convention was in Chicago, Roosevelt in 1932, and I believe Roosevelt was nominated on the third ballot, and it was a very much of a weeding out of candidates, some of whom... They weren't really primaries then, but who were favorite sons and so forth. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago at 1860 on the fourth ballot, so maybe multi-ballot conventions in Chicago were good. Then [inaudible] 19,000 people wrote in and said, ""Are you kidding? What about '68?"" But I would make this point about '68, just not to obsess too much on the replacing Biden thing. It was a horrible mass. Robert Kennedy was tragically assassinated, McCarthy, Humphrey, the violence in Chicago, Dick Daley, the whole nightmare, right? Still, at the end of the day, Humphrey almost won in '68, and I believe Humphrey would've ran better in '68 than Lyndon Johnson would have..."
mAmcboCjTME,8503,Mark Esper,"So you have to plan prudently. Now, when you get to our side of things, again, the Pentagon can certainly do more to move quickly, but in this case, I put a lot of it on Congress. I think if we go back to corporate America, none of the handcuffs that are placed on a CEO that DOD faces, a CEO can shift directions pretty quickly using his or her corporate money to invest in something new or to explore an innovation or increase production. We don't have that flexibility at DOD. For some small amounts of money you do, but for really making a material difference, you have to go back to Congress and get approval by four different committees, and it's a long laborious process. And then there's the annual allocation of funds. And Congress is very reluctant to do what's called multi-year funding. And for corporate America, for the defense industrial base, if you really think you need... I believe we need to increase production to do that, in some cases you need to double or triple shifts or you need to build a new production line or maybe even a new factory. But a defense company's not going to do that unless they can see a steady stream of revenue coming in based on sales that stretches in the years, 'cause you got to pay that off."
Rsk8B-9mB3l,8656,Mark Esper,"When you start getting meddling from the White House, you're really eroding the authority and ability of the departments to move quickly and effectively to implement the president's agenda. For staff to be butting in, national security advisor, that's more of a contest among equals in a certain way. They have the NSC as a role, of course, National Security Council. But I also was struck, see when I was there, and it must've been much more the case when you went into the Trump Administration. The meddling personnel and junior appointments, the attempt to bring in favorites, to do things in jobs, that could make a big difference, though, even then you can't supervise every single thing that happens in some part of the Pentagon that could be quite sensitive, though. I think people don't quite appreciate how risky some of that can be. Some of those people on the National Security Council staff are brought in from the agencies. It's a rotation. They come in from state or defense or the intelligence community. Look, they do a good job, but others are political appointees that are either on NSC or other parts of the White House staff. That's where it got really tricky with President Trump. You never knew who was going in before you or after you and saying, ""Hey, that's wrong,"" or, ""He's wrong,"" or, ""DOD should do this."" During the final year, it became very explicit that people, the NSC had their own views and were pushing hard to implement them despite what Defense or Defense and State were saying, and sometimes they were outlandish ideas."
nq9TfHiPCFN,7197,AB Stoddard,"God knows what Trump will do there. Maybe we will begin to see-God knows you and I have spent eight years being disappointed to say the least by Republicans-but maybe at some point they snap a little bit, or as you said, maybe not even quite the ones who face primaries don't, but then there are others and maybe some candidates emerge somewhere who aren't simply, but maybe not, incidentally, the greed with which the whole party... to me it's just now whole generations of politicians who've made their way by being slavish imitators of Trump and lackies to Trump is, I guess we can't discount that. I think that you're right. If Republican candidates emerge who are critical, Democrats really have to amplify them and embrace them. This needs to be, like you said, at least a year and a half before Democrats want to present a candidate and their own platform and new ideas that are part of their party, identify with their party. They need to join hands with Republicans and independents in a coalition in '25 and '26 to just resist the authoritarian takeover. I have watched them look away from, again, Elon, who is completely conflicted outside of government, unelected, taking away the power of the purse. I've watched them ignore this Signal thing, humiliating Zelensky at the White House."
IjutLJW6h8g,6188,AB Stoddard,"So I think people need to not underestimate the fact that things could be much, much worse in three months or a year. And that's why the time is now to push back and what people can do individually, and I think it's important to mention this when they're not a senator who can make a speech on a floor that goes viral around the world, is they can just talk to each other. It's not that hard. Talk to people in your life about how this is affecting your families or your communities. You don't have to go out and go to a protest and wear a pink hat. You don't have to put your face on camera, you don't have to stick your neck out. It's really about trying to build awareness and energy around the value and magic of our system and why ruining it will be extremely damaging and it'll be hard to get back. And so the sooner people sort of awaken and the sooner they respond the less damage. We'll see. That's really well said AB, and a very good note to end on, and we'll get back together maybe at the end of the fiscal, I don't know, September 30th, whatever would be a good time at the end of the year and really see where we are."
tDOSl4YuFDZ,9371,James Carville,"It's fine to talk about it, experiences she had. I think if I were her, in terms of my past experience, I would talk more about being an AG and being a consumer advocate and being a DA and being tough on crime seems to be kinda in right now, if I say so myself. I've never been very much of a pro-crime guy. It's been in for a long time. I don't think... Especially for Democrats, they need to show it, right? That's been a serious flaw. Most Democrats don't fall for that, most elected Democrats don't fall for that, but it sort of sets something in and there's enough... By the way, I don't want to forget this. There's a big event today in the Democratic Party. Huge. That is the primary election in the first Congressional district of Missouri, think of it as St. Louis, where you have the ultimate, what I'd call ""squadette"" or whatever in Cori Bush. They are-Mark Mellman and them-and she's of course, let's just say she's very pro-Palestinian, to put it at that, but it's an understatement. She's running against a guy named Wesley Bell, who's actually a prosecutor, and describes himself as a Black liberal. Remember that used scare people now. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yes, of course. Come on in. They put a bunch of money in there, but they're running a really smart campaign, all right?"
RTkwQCYuswI,6365,Jack Goldsmith,"This is actually an important distinction. No, this is important, so please spend some time on this, yeah. So this is an important distinction that doesn't get talked about enough. So most people think about reforming the administrative state in the kind of Reagan sense of pulling back the regulations, deregulating through changing the nature of the regulations. So instead of regulating the environment heavily, you regulate it lightly and you change the laws. And there will be a lot of that. But there are the different strategy, structural deregulation, Jody Freeman calls it in an article in the Harvard Law Revie w, which is about basically undermining the agencies, not staffing them, defunding them, attacking them to destroy their reputation, putting people in charge that are going to shut them down effectively. That can be a very effective way of deregulating. And then, there's the civil service reforms that Trump is proposing to make a larger swath of civil servants, political appointees that can be fired at will. Those types of strategies, I think, are going to be much more consequential, the kind of things that I think the DOGE group would be doing. And that's never been tried before in an aggressive way. Trump started to do it in his first term. I think this is the big, underappreciated approach to deregulation here, not through using the Administrative Procedure Act, but just undermining the administrative state through manipulating the Vacancies Reform Act, which you and I have talked about offline, impoundment to try to not allow the agencies to spend appropriated monies."
4WbndcpufRC,7312,Tom Tugendhat,"And so I'm very sorry it has required the invasion, of the attack on Kyiv to do it, but I'm very glad that we've finally woken up. So I think that this is a huge change. Well, let's talk about that for a minute and get back to Ukraine itself and the situation on the ground, but that's important. I mean, how much of a mugging by reality has there been? Or are people understanding, though, coming grips with it? My father used the phrase, ""Neoconservatives and liberals who are mugged by reality."" And a friend of his said, ""Well, there's an awful lot of liberals around who,"" this was 30, 40 years ago, ""who sort of understand that they've been mugged by reality, but don't want to press charges."" Which I thought was a nice way of capturing a certain kind of, ""Well, yeah, Putin's worst than we thought. Who thought he would do this? I predicted he wouldn't, ugh. But on the other hand, we can't really go crazy and we have to work with him and energy and other things. And it's a big country, and China's more of a threat."" And so where do you think we are on the sort of Putin question generally, as you would see in terms of what you would take to be a sound understanding of it, of him and of it?"
N_M4El1bc6w,6791,AB Stoddard,"And you see what gets traction and what doesn't. But again, things get traction to different degrees with different groups. The Democrats want some magic phrase and they sort of hit upon the kitchen table stuff and prices, which is of course a legitimate issue, but a little bit fighting the last war too to some degree and reminds people of Biden and they're sort of surprisingly, yeah, anyway, they overthink. But I feel like Wisconsin might have some effect. They ran a pretty, I was actually had a little zoom couple hours ago with the chairman of the Wisconsin party. They ran it pretty, as he said, we didn't overthink things. This is a pretty straightforward campaign. The Republicans want to use the courts to have their interest groups including the wealthy and Musk is supporting this guy and that can't be good and they want to ban abortion in Wisconsin. That was extremely important part of the message. And they also want to use the courts on some healthcare issues which have come to the Supreme Court to restrict access. And that was basically it. And they just said it over and over again and they had a good candidate, not a famous candidate, but a good candidate, and they won by 10 points. I mean, I do think maybe there's a bit of a lesson there for the other Dems, and maybe things will play into their hands a little bit because they will have to be votes in Congress on reconciliation and on taxes and on things."
ZSAnLHwBLf1,5450,Tom Tugendhat,"We're going to revitalize the word liberal here too. That's our next project here. Right, it doesn't mean communist, it doesn't mean socialist. It's to do with freedom, hence the word, hence the origins of the term. But you know, the alliance of free states, maybe. That's a better way of putting it, would have been eroded. Maybe not in the heartlands, maybe not in places like Canada, but in places on the edge, places that are teetering, places that are trying to decide how to shape their policies for the next 10, 15 years, to make sure that their people are safe and able to survive, I think the erosion of liberty in Europe would have been a hell of an indicator of failure. So I think we shouldn't underestimate the extraordinary courage that Zelensky showed, but also the extraordinary debt that we all owe him as free people, you know? We as free people owe to the Ukrainians. That's a good- They're fighting for us. ...note to end on, but a very appropriate one, because I think you really helped in addition to obviously very helpful analysis of the situation on the ground, really pulled the camera back so to speak, pulled the aperture back, and whatever the metaphor is, and opened it, and really in a very concrete and, I found helpful way, really, to show what's at stake here."
c3lySQrK8Gz,7796,Mark Esper,"And that means going over it and meeting not just your counterparts in countries, but also the heads of state, the prime ministers. And so that was a big part of the job that often gets overlooked. And you really have to balance that out because we do have a Secretary of State who that's his primary job, exclusive job. So foreign policy is a big part of it. And then of course, trying to answer the media, talk to the media, think tank appearances to talk about policy issues. All those things kind of get factored in. So it's quite a task. There's a big staff that kind of help make you successful. But the great thing about the Pentagon, it's staffed by so many wonderful people who are committed to the nation's defense, and that makes long days all the more easier. Even when I came to Washington in my first job at the education department, tiny, tiny, tiny compared to the Pentagon, and I was Bill Bennett's assistant and the chief of staff. I guess I had not... I studied politics. I taught at the Kennedy School. I didn't really appreciate what it was to try to run a department, deal with the Hill, which has legitimate oversight and then annoying oversight of one zone of everything you're doing, and that meant dealing individually with members and of course testifying and that kind of thing, dealing with the media, dealing in your case with foreign governments, dealing with the inter-agency process, which is extremely complex and time- consuming, both formal and informal, you can say a word about that, at your level, the cabinet level with Secretary of State and intelligence agencies, everyone, I mean, it's just so many different spokes, I think that's a little different."
uuHmkgmE43y,5880,Invisible Rulers,"There's another aspect that is not under the DSA itself, but there is also a disinformation code of practice that is voluntary. The platforms can choose which aspects of it they participate in. If I'm not mistaken, X participates in none, but Meta does participate. Anyway, a lot of the American tech companies, well, not a lot ,Meta and X in particular, you heard Mark Zuckerberg reference the egregious European regulation, the onerous regulation in his recent speech talking about how he wanted President Trump to help him take on unfair regulation. And he name-checked Brazil, which went to war with Twitter and briefly shut it down. And then Europe, which is referencing these compliance regimes related to data access and occasional take-down requests. They're also supposed to produce transparency reports, risk assessments and other things to remain in compliance with your European markets. Anyway, it's very boring. It's extremely in the weeds. Those of us who do tech policy find it fascinating, and I think I'm going to do a podcast on it on Lawfare to get into the nuances. But JD Vance was just over in Paris for the AI Summit, and he referenced this in his speech, because what you're starting to see in the US- He referenced it negatively. RENÉE DIRESTA: Negatively. And Jim Jordan- We should not go down this ghastly European road or trying to knock conspiracy theories."
n0oLKJeLVHK,3245,Eric Edelman,"They were unable to do that with the Iranians. They had about a year and a half of desultory negotiations. Never direct negotiations. Iranians refused to meet with the Americans directly. It was all carried out through intermediaries, but no real progress was made. Then October 7th came along and that all sort of went by the boards. Trump has appointed, as I said, his all-purpose negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who is also a negotiating a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, also negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia, to deal with the Iran issue as well. They've had, I think, three sessions already. I think a fourth is to be scheduled. The president said in his comments that the Iranians had, as I said, agreed in principle and that we had provided them with a paper, a document, that outlined our desiderata for an agreement. The Iranians have at various points said they either haven't received it, or they have received it and are considering it but have not scheduled the next round of negotiations. Some of the negotiators, notably including the Foreign Minister Araghchi, who was the Deputy Foreign Minister when the deal was negotiated a decade ago with the Obama folks, he has said that what Steve Witkoff says in public is different from what he says in private."
TJlMErQwTUX,2681,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Whereas those with criminal records, they have fewer options for winning their cases. Congress has been very harsh on people with criminal records over the past few decades. That isn't how it used to be. As much as even 30, 40 years ago, even if you had a felony, you could go to an immigration judge and say, Judge, please give me a second chance. I've reformed. That has largely been eliminated. Congress thought judges were being too liberal and giving too many people second chances and basically eliminated most of the paths to staying in the country of anyone with any kind of criminal record. But on numbers, sorry, really quickly, going back to your question. On numbers. I think one thing to know about the Trump admin is that they will tout whatever numbers they get, even if those numbers are only a 20% increase, they'll talk about how much more it was in the Biden admin. And truthfully, numbers were low under the Biden admin for a couple of reasons. One, COVID heavily disrupted internal enforcement. There were quarantine rules that they had to follow in the first couple of years. And then two, the border heavily diverted ICE resources away from internal enforcement and towards dealing with more recent arrivals. And so as the border gets quieter, those resources can now be re-diverted back to enforcement."
oWtcWwnlQWA,15845,Anne Applebaum,"And I just wondered, A, were you surprised by the degree of coordination among the Europeans and also willingness to lean forward? I mean to really do something, taking on some considerable risks to themselves politically in that way. And I don't know, it just strikes me that you said I think when we had a conversation, it was the one before last, you were more bullish on Europe, I think, than the conventional wisdom. Does that fit in with that? Yeah. No, I mean, at least with its current leadership, this is a Europe that understands ... It's not just that they back Ukraine because the Ukrainians are nice, they understand the stakes. The stakes for them, the stakes for their own security. But I think they also have, as a group, understand the depth and danger of the change inside the United States. And this, again, I don't know how to translate this for Americans, but you are right. I mean, the idea that, what was it? Six or seven leaders of large European countries on the spur of the moment in the middle of August, which is like, everybody goes on vacation in Europe in August. That's part of the deal. All were so alarmed by what they saw in Alaska and by what they feared might have been happening in Alaska behind closed doors that they all got on their various planes and came to Washington to make sure that President Zelensky wasn't bullied by Trump and Vance again like he was back in February."
LIhcvKExzkH,5932,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. Sorry to take so much time to answer it, but it's just a really simple yes. They make it 100% clear that this is what they're doing, and it's only... They know, unfortunately, that we're so narcissistic that we don't even notice. Anyway, for those of you viewers who want to notice, Julia Davis does a terrific job on her and her writing, and in her Twitter feed and on YouTube on just summarizing Russian propaganda day-to-day. If there's any uncertainty about this stuff, she's very helpful on this. And you read her. I read her on Twitter, it's so astonishingly both vulgar and... I don't know, simpleminded isn't even the right word, it's what's what you're saying. There's no artistry, and condescending to their American stooges, and that seems to have no... Not to hurt them much, and I think maybe it's important for them at home to show that we are in charge, and maybe we have these fellow... I think the Soviets were a little this way too to their fellow travelers. They didn't actually treat their somewhat stooge-like fellow travelers here in the US or in Western Europe with great respect, right? It's a very funny mix I think in both cases. I'm sorry, part of my mind is now thinking about how to translate Nashatrampushka ."
M-0jEvb44eu,2490,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"But in absolute numbers, I mean, how big does that end up being? Yeah. So because of the fact that there are visa backlogs in the millions... Congress hasn't updated the number of people who are eligible for visas since 1990, one month from before the World Wide Web went online. It was the last time we changed our legal immigration allocations. Restrictions on the number of people who come here oftentimes don't change the overall number of people entering on visas because there's so many people that if you block 2 million people from getting the visas, there's enough other people in line behind them to fill up all the slots for any given year. The one area where that's not true is immediate relatives of US citizens, which is an unlimited category. So that's parents of US citizens over the age of 21, children of US citizens, and spouses of US citizens. So there, for example, because there are no backlogs, it's unlimited, uncapped. If you block anyone from Afghanistan and there were a hundred people who had spouses from Afghanistan and who wanted to come here, you're going to have a net drop of 100 Green Cards that are going to go to those people because there's no one else who can get them. So we do expect to see a significant drop in family-based immigrant visas, especially for immediate relatives of US citizens because that is a category that is impacted heavily by bans."
DS4EQIeuuxE,2214,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah, that's right. And the Trump administration pitched it at the time as a migrants should apply for asylum closer to home. That was completely made up. There was no requirement that you be anywhere from those, that you've ever been in one of those other countries. And the fact that they would send a Mexican born in Tijuana to Honduras 3,000 miles south shows that that wasn't really valid. The best comparison is the United Kingdom made an extensive failed effort to get Rwanda to take migrants crossing the English Channel from France. And this is a similar thing to what the United States was doing. It would just be to offshore any migrants and sort of force them to go there. And when sent to Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, it's not like you were still applying for protection in the US. They said, all right, to a Salvadoran or Honduran, ""We're going to send you to Guatemala and you have to apply for asylum from Guatemala and you could stay there."" So we think the Trump admin's going to try to renegotiate those deals. We have also heard, through a wide variety of public reporting, that they want to sign a national emergency declaration to bring back money for the border wall, restart construction on the border wall that had been paused under the Biden administration, and then start building new projects."
z1lOzCpV6uL,2380,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So it does sound like they're going to need to go to Congress or want to go to Congress and get tens of billions of dollars to just increase funding to do at least, even if they don't go all the way to Steve Miller land, to do what they want to do and say they want to do and presumably do really want to do in terms of both internal action and the border, right? Yeah. And right now, the combined budget of both border patrol and ICE is a bit over $15 billion. And we are hearing numbers thrown around in the reconciliation package of a hundred to $120 billion, which would be really a sea change. It would allow the agency to become quite possibly the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government, larger than the FBI, larger than the CIA, larger than the NSA, really just a staggeringly large law enforcement agency potentially with tens of thousands of agents if they get that kind of funding. And at that point, it just becomes very hard to predict what this looks like, though of course, just getting the funding is not enough. There is a limit to how many detention beds that are available currently. You'd have to eventually start building new prisons in order to expand capacity."
jPyfBF8TvLf,9692,Mark Esper,"Yeah, they need to do more, but they can't really ultimately do it without us either. So it's a- That's right. We need both to... I mean, the Japanese Prime Minister was kind of remarkable when he was here. Again, it wasn't commented on that much, he spoke to Congress, but I'd say he did stress the importance of winning in Ukraine or defeating Putin. I mean, that's from the Asia, some of the China Hawks want to distinguish Asia from Europe, and we should just focus on Asia and let Europe kind of fall apart. He rejected that pretty strongly, and he didn't have to, so to speak. He was speaking to the US Congress and he really wanted to make that point. The other thing is, you know better than I mean, going from 1% to 2% doesn't sound like that much in a funny way, but for them psychologically, that's a huge jump. Absolutely. That 1% has been kind of a pacifist Japan post-World War II thing- That's right. ...for 80 years. Yeah, it's more than just a number, it is a psychological threshold. It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades."
IDa76f4eW7O,3304,Doug Sosnik,"So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC. So if something were to happen at a Republican convention, I don't know what they would do except I do know that the MAGA forces are going to decide what happens. I think it's quite different on the Democratic side. As a party coalescing behind Biden, the organizing principle about being for Biden is to stop Trump, and as I think I've mentioned before to you, he's the first person elected president since 1988, when George H. W. Bush got elected for essentially a Reagan third term, which I'm sure you remember quite well... Biden is the first guy since Bush to get elected without a political base. And so his base of support, if there is one, is an anti-Trump support. So if you take these people that have coalesced as a party, and the party's more of a federation of interests really than it is a party that's got a narrow focus like Republicans now, it's unclear what those delegates would do at the convention if it got to that, because of the motivation of how they got there."
GS75LOXRy0p,6525,Aaron Friedberg,"And he kind of brought it along with him on all of these issues to some extent on Ukraine, certainly on the Middle East. And I'm not confident that Harris coming next is going to continue to exert that kind of pressure. And I'm concerned that there will be counter pressures from other parts of the Democratic Party, foreign policy establishment who will be trying to push her. That's the sort of Obama 2.0 scenario that I'm concerned about. The big unknown there is Harris herself, and partly because the things that she said, they're fine, but they are kind of rote recitations of standard view or standard ways of explaining what's going on in the world and what needs to be done. But what exactly are her views and convictions? To what extent does she share Biden's, I don't want to say black and white, but somewhat more ideological view of the world. To what extent does she share his, really share his gut instinct regarding American leadership? I don't know. It's quite possible that she's received an extraordinary education in the last four years because of where she's been sitting. And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they've been, in my view, for the most part, the right thing to say."
mRUP5td4v4B,6949,Jack Goldsmith,"The closest analogy, I think, to the Hunter Biden pardon is Ford's pardon of Nixon, where he basically pardoned him for a long period of time for crimes that he'd not yet been charged with. He was an unindicted co-conspirator, and so he was still in the middle of things. Of course, that was an historically unique context that was controversial at the time, not legally, but politically. Some people still do argue about the legality of these forms of pardons, but there's good case law support for them, in my view. So anyway, it's an extraordinary pardon, and it's right up there with the most extreme pardons in terms of scope and covering things that he hasn't even been charged for or that he was in the middle of being charged for. Anyway, because it was his son, because he promised he wouldn't do it, it sets a bad precedent, obviously. Yeah. The promise that he wouldn't do it, I think, it was also a bad precedent, again, certainly going forward. I mean, I guess, Trump, since you mentioned that he really blew up some of these norms, pardoning people in the middle of his term, or partway through his term, two-thirds way through his term, who might have testified against him or might have spoke... that's closer to the sense, for me at least, of the abuse that's kind of really corrupting justice."
lwwj33_0Gp3,6546,Jack Goldsmith,"And now Elon Musk is going to apparently, I don't know, have a roaming all over the government trying to find savings and efficiencies, which that's fine. But he's not a government employee, so he doesn't have all the conflict, I guess, so he doesn't have all the conflict of interest and ethics things. That's how they're going to take it, I think. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. But of course, no one's not going to share information with the president's-one of his closest-confidants and advisors, who's been announced as doing this Office-of-whatever-they-call-it- Government-something... Efficiency. And so, he'll have access to all kinds of stuff without having, including contracting, I should think and so forth, without anything... Maybe. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. I'm struck that people don't even raise it, I guess, is what I'm saying. It's sort of your point, right? We used to be kind of fastidious about these things. Some people are raising it. And let me tell you, on the Musk group, whatever it's going to look like, there's going to be some serious litigation about that. The Federal Advisory Committee Act is designed to govern just this situation. It has rules about, again, depending on the role that Musk plays, it has rules about transparency, conflict of interest, organization. I'm confident they're going to try to structure this in a way that circumvents this statute."
8xGUIhCyhIY,6454,Tom Tugendhat,"I mean, these are acts of barbarity the like of which we haven't seen since the Second World War. I mean, it's absolutely horrific what we're seeing. So your perception on whether or not you're willing to respond to it I think depends very much on where you see it. And for me, the various wake-up calls were seeing not just Russian corruption in London, but seeing the corruption spreading to some UK institutions, seeing some banks, some lawyers, some accountants, some estate agents tolerant of a corruption that frankly is incredibly, incredibly damaging to our democracy and to our freedoms. And I'm afraid, it's not my business, but I could point to parts of the United States and say the same thing there. And it brings me no pleasure to say it. Quite the reverse, it brings me nothing but sadness because the reality is that crime festers in the dark. And at the moment, we're seeing too much darkness. And do you think that's now much more broadly perceived though in the UK and throughout the West? And are we willing to come to grips with the Russian threat, so to speak? I'm curious about what your perception is for France, Germany, some of the major... The Central and Eastern Europe seem, they see what they see pretty uniformly."
gwBPfx4fEZ6,8471,Mark Esper,"And to a person, to a man, they said, ""Nope, don't resign,"" because that was my inclination, it was Mark Milley's inclination. They said, ""Make him fire you. Do what you need to do, make him fire you,"" and that's the way to hold on and execute your strategy. And I did follow that, and it was the right way to go. And so I actually did not intend to resign, but I did want to have something ready in case I was asked to do something that I thought was immoral or illegal or something like that and there was no other way out of it, I would have to resign. Say a word about, and I think people don't understand fully how the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint, Chiefs, the Civil-Military relations side of it, I mean, you and General Milley worked very closely together on these kinds of things, as well, as many other things, I'm sure. But the Sec Def is... And people have great faith in the military, which I think is good and mostly justified. But the civilian leadership matters, right? I mean, it also affects who the military leadership is since the civilian leadership appoints ultimately the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders and so forth and promotes generals and all."
uBq5NhzTJWJ,5318,Tom Tugendhat,"Then France, and then Britain. And so, I think this kind of intelligent, I don't know what you'd call it exactly, nation state specific multilateralism has always been there among the better thinkers in the West and better practitioners really. And you're right, it's a good way of formulating it that gets us out of the trap of either everything has to be UN-like. I don't know what everyone agreed on. I mean, it's fine if 180 nations do want to agree on some things, and some things you should have. The World Health Organization would be so much better if you could have common... And all kinds of things like that. But in other cases, the more these regional and ad hoc approaches seem, especially in national security, I would say, right to be more- Right, but I'd say not just in national security. I mean, the interesting thing is, of course, the underpinning of national security is the economic freedoms, the economic strength that we get, frankly, through freedom. There's a reason people fight for freedom. It works. It just does. And it's perfectly clear to me that when we fight for economic cooperation, for free trade, for the kind of things that we embedded into the early days, very early days, we embedded in an embryonic state into the World Trade Organization."
q1tllVEmhH8,6402,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely. What are our friends and allies in Asia going to make of this outcome? And they've been very blunt now, Japanese leaders in particular, but Taiwanese too, saying, ""We have a stake in the outcome of this war between Ukraine and Russia because what happens there today could happen in Asia tomorrow."" So what would be the responses to that? I suppose you could say they're going to cling even more tightly to the United States, and maybe in the first instance that would be true, but I think the leaders of Japan, Korea, Taiwan too, would be foolish if they didn't consider the possibility that they too at some point might be hung out to dry. And they would have to think seriously about how they could defend themselves under those circumstances. And one obvious answer to that question is to acquire their own nuclear weapons. South Korean- there's been an open discussion about that in South Korea and Japan. It's more of a taboo subject, but less than it once was. So there are kind of quieter conversations about that going on."
A-Dvak24Q6l,3671,David Axelrod,"He was very agile. He was a very good candidate and could carry a message in a way that we needed to. One thing about that '92 election-not to belabor the point, but I think there are lessons from it-you remember, I think Bush showing going into a grocery store because someone decided, Hey, maybe we better, there's concern about the economy and being unfamiliar with I guess the reader or something. The scanners were new at that point. This was a bum rap. We had a complicated explanation at the time, which we wasted two weeks trying to persuade people why this was a bum rap. It abetted a portrait of him as a guy who was an effete, who was out of touch with the lived experience of Americans in this case. I don't think people think Biden is unaware of the lived experience of Americans, but they think that he is out of touch right now and they blame age for it. He's got to show that he's very much in touch with what's going on in the experience of everyday people when they visit the grocery store, when they pay their rent, when they pay their mortgage, when they go to the... I always watched gas prices very closely when I was in the White House, and these are the ways... you don't necessarily watch all of these economic indices, but what you do watch is the numbers going up on the gas tank when you're filling your gas on the gas dispenser, whatever."
gGGNCGO14wP,15927,Anne Applebaum,"Plus there's other kinds of economic support and so on. I think European, there was a kind of Czech-led project to collect ammunition from around the world, that's had an impact. And so there's no question that Europe is now the more important source of aid, military aid and economic aid for Ukraine than the United States. I mean, the United States still has a couple of key capabilities, and one of them is the US satellites and intelligence that make a big difference for Ukrainian drones and targeting and so on. And there are a few handful of US weapons that would still make a big difference in this war, mostly long-range artillery of different kinds. I mean, actually a lot of the stuff that we all thought would be very important earlier on in the war like tanks, turns out not to be that important. I mean, I don't know that Americans have really understood this either. This is a really new kind of war. It's being fought in a different way from any other war in recent history. It's a drone war. Within 10 kilometers of the front line, nobody can move without being seen. So a tank or a truck or anything that crosses into that zone is immediately spotted and can be hit. And it's very difficult to move one direction or another."
xy4cRAkq6q5,5899,Invisible Rulers,"Anyway, but go ahead. RENÉE DIRESTA: I think it varies. I struggle with that because I think it really varies over time. What you're talking about, tulip mania, McKay kind of opens with that, is a big one of these sort of cautionary tales. I was at Jane Street for a while. It was one of the books that they give junior traders when you're- Is that right? RENÉE DIRESTA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you're brand new. So yes, I read that in 2004 or something. But no, it is this... And I think about it as this cautionary tale, that momentum might be taking us in one direction, but that doesn't mean that it's correct. The market can remain irrational longer than you remain solvent is the sort of Wall Street take on that. But the question about being resistant to correction is an interesting one. And again, as I mentioned, the anti- vaccine letters to the editor in the medical journals in the 1860s, they're there. And the letters back from the doctors, they're incredibly blunt. They're like, ""Why are we publishing these idiots,"" is basically the response. So you do see that frustration. Like, ""Why are these people not deferring to my authority,"" is sort of the response even back then. But I think the challenge that we face now is that..."

And we said, ""Man, if we could lose this thing 74/26 in Blair County and Luzerne County,"" and you go through the whole laundry list of them, then you would really in effect change sea level. That was our total thinking and that we could get much more bang for... So, if you think about it, you pull out a new voter in Philadelphia, you net one vote. You get a Trump 2016 voter in Cambria County and they become a Biden 2020 voter, you actually net two votes. The math works in your favor. And we were able... In most of our donations are pretty high-end people, a lot of them in finance, and they understand that. I'd say, ""Look, if you've got 10 things and you got four underperforming assets, it's pretty good if you get one of them to perform a little less worse."" That's what we're trying to of. Right. Less underperformance counts just as much in the stock market as better or overperformance, right? Exactly. Exactly. That's a good way of putting it. When you're fortunate enough to have people that understand that and can explain it, it's a valuable thing because most people want to just give money to Amy McGrath or fund something that they like. A Detroit voter registration project, which I have nothing against."
LLckA5pMzi8,13810,Anne Applebaum,"I mean there is something like a coalition of the willing emerging, and it certainly includes Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Poland, now Germany, UK, France, depending on their elections, Romania, and a handful of other large countries, maybe Italy, maybe Spain, they're a little farther away from the war and they don't feel it as sharply. But there's clearly a group of countries who feel directly that Russia is a threat to them economically, as I said, in cyber, in sabotage in many other ways. And you'll see them working together, they will be making heavy defense investments. I mean, the big argument in Germany is going to be, how much money, can we finally borrow money? Germans have weird rules about debt. You're not allowed to have debt in Germany. That's another historical hangover. And so, there may be an attempt to create a defense bank. I mean, basically they need a lot more defense spending right now and I think they'll- They don't have the ability to... I think they'll do it, I mean, the question is- You can't flip a switch and have- ...how fast can it be done? That's the problem. Right. And you can't flip a switch and have the munitions capabilities and so forth. I mean, there's some elements to the war that I think people don't really understand."
p0yUOQ19Ixa,9151,James Carville,"Well, yeah, I guess if an average American did that, I would think. Because that's just not an everyday occurrence in America, is it? When you stop and you think about it, I'm sure I wasn't there for closing, but I'm sure the prosecution argued, look, the law entitles you to certain information before you make a decision. That's your right, the law grants that to you, and he hid that from the American people who were the real victims here. If it didn't matter, then if it was public, then people could easily conclude that it didn't matter. But they weren't given that choice. Because of Mr. Trump's duplicity, that was hidden from people, which they had a right to know. I think if you make that argument, the fraud that was perpetrated was on the people, on the voter, I think that'll take you a longer way. Yeah, that's good. That's good. And it is also good to talk about the facts of the case. Well, I don't know if the average American did this and you go through it and go, Jesus did all that happen? Yeah, it all happened. That would be something if on June 27th Biden says what you just said, that would be a memorable moment in American presidential politics. Yeah, like I say, the Republicans have, I mean, first of all, your group, which is can't say enough good about the way that y'all understand the threat ahead and let's don't whine and complain."
m7z0efU9xIr,6547,Aaron Friedberg,"So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons. And also providing more of them to Ukraine, conceivably, along with others in Europe. There's a fair amount of people singing up to do that, which could move things in one direction, which would have its own effects in terms of Putin, I suppose. Or the opposite, obviously, if Trump were to win and try to insist on some kind of negotiated settlement. So anyway, though, very unpleasant stalemate, not even a stable stalemate, if I can put it that way. No, I don't think it's reached that point. And therefore, in part for that reason, both sides clearly want to keep on. They haven't reached the point where they've both suffered enough pain and paid enough of a price that they're willing to consider some kind of ceasefire or try to come to some negotiated settlement. I don't see that in the offing. As you say, and maybe we come back to this, there are those two branches, question of whether the U.S. and others would assist the Ukrainians in escalating in some way that might have hope of bringing about a more successful outcome."
YFbm3LrxX2T,3819,Doug Sosnik,"The one thing, Super Bowl did have the highest ratings ever, and that was predictable that it was going to have very high ratings. And people are happy when they're watching the Super Bowl generally, I think, and maybe they're worried about their own team if they're in San Francisco or Kansas City, but otherwise it's a spectacle, you get together. And that's always been such a gimme for the incumbent president to have a pleasant interview with two sports announcers, in this case on CBS, who presumably are going to ask totally nice questions to Biden and let him talk a little bit about how much he likes sports and reminiscing about playing football with his kids, whatever he wants, who he's rooting for, did he grow up rooting for the Eagles? I mean, whatever. And the fact that they didn't do that, I feel is now maybe he just didn't want to do it and he's busy. I mean, there are a million things, right? But maybe I'm wrong that it's always such an easy interview, but I feel like, geez, can you really go through- have a strategy for nine months where you're not... They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report."
vexKvcDoMqS,2904,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And it's of course, just to emphasize, it is a crackpot legal theory pushed by John Eastman, primarily. The disgraced and disbarred John Eastman of the 2020 Big Lie efforts to overturn the election. He is the main legal ""scholar,"" and I put ""scholar"" in quotes here, who has argued that the president can do this. There is no groundswell of conservative judicial support for this. This is not something the conservative legal movement has ever supported. Even some arch-conservative judges right now put in place by Trump have said in the past that birthright citizenship is obviously the law of the land. And this is not even something that's from the 14th Amendment. We've had birthright citizenship since the founding of the country. It's an ancient English common law practice that has been around for centuries. Do you think he will issue an executive order, which will immediately get enjoined in court, presumably just to say he's done it? Yeah. Pretty much. I think that's the most likely scenario. He issues an order. It's blocked in court within days. No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status."

There'll be many similar things- Yes, I agree. ... in justice all the way down to career people. I agree. ... the assistant attorney general jobs to... These are vital. That's where the rubber meets the road. Excuse me. The assistant attorney general jobs are where the rubber meets the road in terms of-and assistant secretary jobs- rubber meets road about whether the policies are going to have a chance of getting implemented and with what integrity they'll be implemented. So those are the jobs to keep one's eye on. My friend, Chris Landau, was just named to be the Deputy Secretary of State. Chris is a A+ person and I think he'll do an excellent job there. I was very encouraged by that, but we'll see. You're absolutely right, it's very important. It's the next level of jobs. There was a column in The Journal about this couple of days ago, I think by... I can't remember who it was, but that it's the next level job political appointees that are so important and that we'll learn a lot from about how law-abiding they're going to be."

Well, last thing, give us, you're used to following Washington and the cycles of the seasons, so to speak, but of Congress, I suppose in particular. What to look for in your opinion, when would you say, when will we have more of a sense of the possible Republican defections, possible Democratic resistance strengthening, possible intra-Trump administration issues or external issues having an effect or not? Are we looking at you expecting... would we be having a very different conversation two months from now, six months from now, 18 months from now? What's your time horizon here? I think by the end of this year, there will be a lot of division in the Republican party because they have all of the budget and tax fights ahead, and that's really going to be... I don't know, maybe they all fall in line. But look, they fought over proxy voting this week in the house. I mean, there's plenty of fodder for Republicans to fight and to divide and for rifts to open up. And I see... you mentioned Ukraine, and it is a good issue Democrats should exploit to divide Republicans. Trump is using some occasional tough talk on Putin, and he's going at this plan that he said was only going to take one day to bring peace to the region, which we all know means give a bunch of territory to the Russians."
KvIWRmyTOZp,7012,A.B. Stoddard,"This is an amazing thing that you look at the same polls I do that Pence and Haley are always number three and four, which is stunning to me. I understand the appeal of Nikki Haley. A very solid resume, a non-white woman, that's exciting to a lot of Republicans. Mike Pence consistently holds at third place, usually over her. Right now, I think in the morning consult poll, he's at 6%. He is now, as of today, going to launch. Allies are launching a PAC in favor as he considers an exploratory committee. And we've talked about this before. We don't see his constituency, we don't see his path, but he is refusing to engage in the culture wars. His allies say if he runs, this likely campaign will be issues-centric. Nikki Haley, again, she'll say a few things here and there on Twitter, but she really tries to be policy-based. She tries to retreat from the culture war. Tim Scott- not running on the culture war. So if Chris Sununu and Chris Christie get in, I doubt that they will be running on culture wars. But Ron DeSantis is all in on culture wars, and he obviously has a solid resume of accomplishments he could be running on. I mean, he does, but he also just wants to be sort of second MAGA king in line, and he has the most appeal."

When you're filling your gas tank. You do look at the cash register when you're buying groceries. There just needs to be more attention to that. I think, David Plouffe said to you recently on a panel you did, that's a very good... your colleague in 2008 and 2012. Yeah, brilliant campaign manager. Great- Great campaign manager. He said something about how there's always a temptation to want to lecture the voters about how you should be happier than you are. The right message is, I understand why you're unhappy. Yes. It's so hard for me, but I guess you're saying that's very important, right? That's number, that's rule... That's number one. The second thing is you need to make this a very comparative campaign. You cannot allow this to be a referendum in an environment in which 65% of the country feels like things are on the wrong track. People need to understand this is a choice now. It's not a choice between, as Biden used to say, between him and the Almighty."
lMcOk15pf2O,3492,David Axelrod,"All of these constituencies are soft now. Trump's getting upwards of 20% in most polls of African-American voters, Hispanic voters are running even now, even young voters are running even. Yeah. And so, I think in some ways, you have to really think about, how do you get at least a necessary share of those voters back? And there too, I think, economics is as important as anything. So everything leads me back to those economic issues. Interesting. Which is slightly contrary to the general tendency of the media to want to focus on whatever the latest cultural outrage is. Someone made a good point to me, the Bible stuff last week with Lee Greenwood- Yes. ...the grifter, huckster $59.99 Bible where you get some American documents and Lee Greenwood song. I want to know, by the way, is Trump going to produce Trump-branded Passover Haggadas? Yeah, from Maxwell House to Trump... Yeah. Don't even give him the idea. Jared Kushner and those guys, they'll be on top of it and it's going to be a nightmare, we'll be dealing with it for decades, just like Maxwell House, they'll never go away. Exactly. I don't know, I was actually not that upset about the Bible and all that Lee Greenwood stuff, but I was talking with someone about it, and he doesn't follow politics that much, but he's smart, he said, ""Look, that's just Trump."
Y3wraBW6mNT,6543,Jack Goldsmith,"And this has gone on really from the beginning of the nation in some sense with peaks and valleys. And in some sense, I'm sympathetic to the idea that a president should be able to come in and especially, and frankly, Republican presidents, and I think you'd agree with this, have always received more resistance from ...I'm making a general claim. It hasn't always been there. I mean, not in every case, but have in general received more resistance from the civil service than Democratic presidents. That was very true in the Trump administration. There was organized resistance along a number of dimensions. So I can understand why a president would want to come in, and they tried to do this at the end of the last term, and to have more control over more jobs so that they can implement their program. That's the benign case for the civil service reform. By the way, I don't think it's quite as easy. They're not going to be able to implement this at the snap of the fingers. It's a complicated set of legal moves. It might take a year. It involves some hard legal questions about Article II, but we can talk about that later if you want. The other side of the story is that Trump is trying to get in 50,000 more loyalists, not just so that he can ensure that his programs get implemented that he ran on, but to do other things, corrupt things, things that benefit him personally."
nvzgZJTNbjW,3604,Doug Sosnik,"And I think particularly for Democrats, the third party option is also a reflection that they could have the satisfaction enough, while they don't go out and vote third or fourth or fifth party, they just may not vote. And the other thing I'll just mention, I alluded to it earlier, back with Reagan and took control of the race in the last 10 days in 1980 after the first debate, I think it was October 28th, if you have a debate this October 28th, over half the country would have already voted. So in terms of when is when, it starts right after Labor Day. People are going to be voting around America, across a number of states, all throughout September and well in October, and by election day in 2020 I think 68% of the people, I think, had already voted. So as you're thinking about, quote-unquote, nine months into the election, you really need to back it up, because you're really going to feel the deadline encroaching, because if you live in Michigan and some of these early voting states, they're actually going to be voting in September. And then if you look a few weeks before that is the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and so I think in August is going to be the real truth test for people about what they're going to do."

But they're helping Iran by buying its oil. And there probably is also technical cooperation. Something else that a number of people have wondered about is the extent to which there may be direct or indirect Chinese learning going on from both the war in Ukraine and the fights that are going on in the Middle East. And there are a lot of weapon systems that are being used and tested on both sides. This is an opportunity to see Western, or particularly American, weapons and how they're used. And it's also an opportunity to test various concepts of operations and weapons that the Chinese are interested in. So whether there are Chinese observers on the ground, as there were German and Soviet observers on the ground during the Spanish Civil War or not, China is watching this very carefully and undoubtedly learning lessons from it. Wow. And we talked about a week ago or 10 days ago, and one reason I wanted to have this conversation was the comment you made, you were walking through some of this stuff just very quickly with me, and then I think you said something like, ""But of course the biggest source of instability or concern right now is probably our election,"" not any of these actual, not to minimize these foreign policy developments... but not simply these foreign policy developments."

There's a lag when there's an economic recovery or when inflation goes down."" But gradually that eventually kicks in and it should affect the job approval. And I think some of the intelligent Democrats I've spoken with are a little, panicked's too strong, but concerned, that so far, it's not translating. I mean, voters seem able to say, ""I have more confidence in the economy, more consumer confidence."" They even kind of know inflation is not as bad as it was. But that doesn't, so far, hasn't really translated to a job approval number. There's a lag and that's normal. But what I will say is I worked for President Clinton for six years, and as we all remember, those of us old enough can remember, we had our ups and our downs. But when someone asked me when was a real low point for us, or for me, and that was after the 1994 midterm elections where the Democrats got destroyed and Clinton's job approval was not that far away from where Biden's is now. What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring of '95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching him."
HvGAtOkDe3y,6297,Aaron Friedberg,"And then the war with Hezbollah, which has been ongoing, in a way, I guess it's been ongoing for a couple of decades. Low-grade conflict has flared up with a series of remarkable Israeli strikes against Hezbollah at all levels, culminating, at least for the moment, with the airstrikes that killed the leader, Nasrallah, just a couple of days ago, and everybody's waiting for the other foot to fall, whether that's Hezbollah retaliation, or Iranian retaliation, or an Israeli incursion into Southern Lebanon on the ground, which is something which seems like a real possibility. So that's percolating. And the Houthis continue to harass shipping in the Red Sea. And the Israelis have also evidently conducted some operations against the Houthis, so that's ongoing. In Europe- Let's just, on the Middle East- Yes. ...for one second. Yeah. And the Iranian nuclear program hasn't come to a halt, I don't think. And they seem to have suppressed their domestic troubles for a while, at least, unfortunately. So, yeah, it's pretty unstable situation. It looked for a while, like, I don't know, there wasn't going to be a new Middle East, but the Abraham Accords, and a little bit of, and Gaza was, one forgets, quiet, not quiet-ish, more or less quiet, until a year ago. The Hezbollah situation was a standoff."
a33reWJ-O7p,6860,Aaron Friedberg,"He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject. And that is revealing because I think that is the way he looks at it. And if that becomes the first kind of big fork in the road he faces as president, which I guess it might, support for Ukraine, you just said a word about the ramifications elsewhere. So say something about that. It's not as if these things, they do have an effect, even if he thinks he's going to be status quo and with respect to China for six months or something like that. Well, and this is one of the problems I have, again, with people who are trying to put forward a coherent alternative to policies that the current administration has been pursuing or alternative grand strategies, Asia First, that kind of thing, as if you could take this piece off the board and ignore it or somehow that it would take care of itself and everything else would remain the same. And of course, that's not the way the world really works. So if you imagine a world in which the US pulls back its support from Ukraine, presumably our European allies might at least for some period of time try to fill that gap."
XywcCCdL7Zh,7900,Robert Kagan,"And in the South, in the 19th century, the realists in the South that the first sort of... People say things in the South which sound realist, is the Southern view that we don't want to be promoting liberalism overseas when people were getting exercised about Greek liberation from Turkey or the Hungarian Revolution, et cetera. And the South was always saying, ""That's none of our business. Let's not get into it."" So anti- liberalism- And if we're going to take in new states, they should be slave states. The degree to which you make this point in your book, in Dangerous Nation , I mean, how much slavery drives all these- Everything. Right. ...quote, ""foreign policy debates"" in the early, prior to the 19th century, first half of the 19th century. Right. And now if I were writing that book again, I would've added, because of my understanding of what I learned later, that, yes, they were defending the institution of slavery, and they felt that if the North could run foreign policy in a pro-liberal direction, it could also go after slavery, which was true. A lot of people in the North did feel that way, but they were also anti-liberal. I mean, they were officially anti-liberal. They said the Declaration of Independence was a mistake. It didn't need to be there."
5wdBdCPne2f,9648,James Carville,"They had him eating pudding with his fingers. And the story is she was the big operative. She made him. He was this guy with no personality and she got him elected to Congress. He was not supposed to win for governor. She got him elected governor. And then Mrs. DeSantis turned on her and drove her right to Mar-a-Lago, and Ron DeSantis ain't been the same since he's [inaudible] with Ms. Wiles, I promise you. When this all emerges... and I don't even think I know her. Her daddy was like, Pat Summerall, was a big time sports announcer. Right. I got to tell you, from a distance, man, that woman wields a really effective knife. Phew. No, I think that's important, and I do think they're kind of underestimated. So, Trump goes to the South Bronx for that 4,000 person rally the other night after the trial. And then- And everyone's ridiculing him up there. -the two felons up there. What's that? The two felons. Yeah. He had the felons, so that was a little lunatic. Yeah. But everyone was ridiculing him on the Democratic Biden campaign. He's going to a place he can't win, New York. And what's he wasting his time for? I feel like that was pretty effective. He showed that he's willing to go anywhere."
ACm72wdf6sT,6234,Larry Summers,"But if it does, it will be in circumstances where that's the least of our problems. And the example is the loss of the British pound status as a reserve currency in the mid-1950s, particularly after Suez. Britain lost the pound as a reserve currency, but after Suez and in the 1950s, that was the least of Britain's problems. So we won't just lose the dollar as a reserve currency because others will build up deep capital markets and [inaudible] will shift towards their currency. But if we become a not predictable, not rule of law kind of place that is universally distrusted, that could lead to very substantial movements away from the dollar. But if we become a lawless place, the fact that we don't have the exorbitant privilege anymore that lets us borrow a bit cheaper will be the least of our problems. So I am worried about the future of the dollar, but more that it could be a symptom of even profounder and deeper problems than because it would itself be an impetus to decline. No, that's very interesting and well said. I guess there's a reason this discipline was originally called ""political economy"" and maybe should still be, and you treat it that way certainly. Politics matters a lot for economics and vice versa. What about the international side?"
vYFQL1qG0gy,6153,Invisible Rulers,"Does that make this... How should I put it? Does that make propaganda, or let's be neutral and just say ""information,"" somehow more powerful? It's quicker, it's faster than, I suppose, in the old days. And is it more powerful? Is it something almost qualitatively different from the description you just described from 1947? I mean, how different, how new is this world we're in? Or how much is it just, ""Hey, it's radio and now it's this,"" and what's all the... We can think of it in the same way. It feels different. It feels... The instantaneous character... RENÉE DIRESTA: It feels different. ... of it, the mob character of it, and so forth. But, discuss. RENÉE DIRESTA: A lot of it is very similar. The way that propaganda works, a lot of the time it's tapping into identity-based needs. One of the things that you really see on the internet is people assembling into very identity-based groups. And this happens partially because of culture, partially because of particularly polarized culture, the internet is reinforcing that. Algorithms though do key off of things that you like, things that people who are like you like. And then when that happens, you are put into these buckets, if you will, where you're going to see more of a certain type of thing, so those identities are reinforced."
V8423T9Cw2K,8196,James Carville,"Boom. Boom. And who the jury is, who they elect foreman, how articulate she or he is. Yeah, it all depends a lot, but how that jury justifies what they did can have a lot of effect on public opinion, and we never really considered politics in this, to be honest with you. The judge told us not to and we tried to follow. The judge said it's like any other American would. Any of that kind of talk will get you a long, long way. Yeah, that's interesting. I do think people have been a little too quick to dismiss that case. It's not the case everyone wanted. It's not January 6th, it's not federal court, but yeah, jury convictions have a certain- My favorite is Fareed Zakaria, who's a nice guy, but he said, ""Yeah, if an ordinary American did this he wouldn't be indicted."" Well, what ordinary American is going to have sex with a porn star, ask the porn star to beat him on the butt with a rolled-up magazine, then have a catch-and-kill story, then come up with $130,000 so somebody doesn't find out and embarrass your presidential campaign. Well, yeah, I guess if an average American did that, I would think. Because that's just not an everyday occurrence in America, is it? When you stop and you think about it, I'm sure I wasn't there for closing, but I'm sure the prosecution argued, look, the law entitles you to certain information before you make a decision."
36_PcaYik_w,8409,Robert Kagan,"I mean, people like that are just being cowards. But your average Republican voter, who I think is probably a white... Even a white suburban male in particular does not feel that he's going to really lose out in this other system, whatever it's going to be. I mean, the counterargument would be that they think, he thinks, maybe incorrectly, that the guardrails will still kind of hold, sort of like the first term and that it won't change America as much as you're saying it would. No, I get that. And I've never claimed that I'm 100% certain that Trump is going to introduce a dictatorship, but I think any honest person would say the risk is high. Even if there's a 20% chance that Trump will do all the things he says he's going to do, isn't that too much of a risk to take? And then they have to convince themselves or convince us, or whoever's listening that somehow Biden is a bigger threat to the republic than Trump. I don't believe any normal person, any reasonable person could come to that conclusion. And so you have to ask, how sincere is that belief and how much is it that they're just cool with Trump? I just think we have to face that possibility. I mean, the in-between stage, and I guess students of the psychology of authoritarianism and stuff and authoritarian movements have really studied this a lot, is a kind of wishful thinking where you don't quite have to..."
YMEx-gGucJB,8832,Mark Esper,"Yeah, I ended up calling them the four no's. As you said, it was no politicization of the military, no strategic retreats, no misuse of the military. And of course, the fourth one would flee from my mind- No aggressive war. No [inaudible]. Yeah, no unnecessary wars. Because there were people within the administration in the year of 2020 who were, for one reason or another, the National Security Advisor wanted to go after Iran or go after Venezuela or do this or do that, and skipping over diplomacy and sanctions and everything else that might happen to use the military, and I was very concerned about us being used in, us being DOD, being used in that way, but also with not looking at other options, but also as a political tool. And so there was that. And what happened at Lafayette Park, Mark Milley and I we're duped, but it was, look, we should have had better political antennae. We recalibrated that point, and that's where we came up with the four no's. And I said, ""I've got to get to the election."" My timeline was get to the election. My red lines were the four no's, and my strategy was to play defense on the outside and offense on the inside. So offense on the inside meant within DOD, within the Pentagon, I wanted to keep forward moving all the initiatives I had underway to modernize the military, to focus on China, to improve the lives of our service members, go as hard as I could, play offense for the next six or seven months, but outside the Pentagon, be in a far more defensive stance, be far more calibrated to people trying to use DOD for political reasons, and so that became my strategy."
wgu55yAEkCR,11099,Mark Esper,"With Ukraine, he said he'd cut off funding, cut off support, and he would negotiate an agreement within 24 hours. Yeah, what is that? Which is fancy fool. The only person who could stop this war in 24 hours is Vladimir Putin. But he's also attacked NATO, said it's not a good deal for the United States and had made attempts during his first term to undermine the alliance. So look, I take him at face value for his view on those. He said similar things about our allies in Asia. So I think he would pursue those things in a second term because he's unbound by the need to kind of play to a reelection, because there will not be another term after that. And so then the other big question becomes, who does he put in his cabinet? Myself and Mike Pompeo and John Bolton would talk him out of these things or at times when it came to funding Ukraine, trying to talk him into providing funding for Ukraine. So a key part here is one him, but the opposite side of the coin are who are the people he brings around him at both the Departments of State, Defense and elsewhere, but also in the White House because the people there have a big influence on him as well."
tS3iLwws0Jb,6821,Tom Tugendhat,"And he's managed to get German foreign policy changed pretty radically in recent months. His Zeitenwende , his sort of time of change as it were that he spoke about in February means that he's pledged 100 billion euro to German defense spending, which is, it's not nothing. That's a hell of an increase. And he's speaking about different ways of helping the Ukrainian people as well, so that's not nothing. Although, I did read recently that a Polish minister was referring to the end of Ostpolotik politic and the beginning of ""lost politik."" And there is a tension now between some of those countries that border Russia or near border Russia, like Poland. I would say it borders Belarus rather than Russia. But those bordering states, near bordering states, and those that are further away, and there's a certain resentment between them and the level of commitment that some are showing and others could. And they'll have to show commitment at home, right? It'll be cold in the winter and energy prices will go up a lot and they may be, I don't know, rationing and so forth with gas and they let themselves get dependent on Russia. Unfortunately, we didn't do much to help them the other way, I will say, to be fair to them. Everyone beats up Germany, but it wasn't as if we were saying..."
vDTWQK1PH4H,3928,Doug Sosnik,"And so for completely different reasons. I think they're obviously in a much stronger position within their own parties now than they were back in June. What's different, and it is different, is the race, I would say from the beginning of last year until around the middle to end of October, was pretty static. And it had Biden ahead of Trump, both nationally and in the battleground states. It was consistent. It wasn't an overwhelming lead, but it was a lead of 2, 3, 4 points pretty much consistently. The polls never changed. Over the last three and a half, four months, the race has changed. And it started, I would say around the end of October with a series of polls that came out. There was a six-state battleground New York Times poll, which had Trump ahead in all six battleground states. And pretty significantly, the NBC poll that came out in early November had Trump ahead for the first time in their polling. And their Wall Street Journal poll came out in November, which not only showed the same Trump advantage, but they asked a series of questions which haven't changed in the last three and a half months, which compared voters' views of what life was like when Trump was president compared to what life is like with Biden as president."
VKlKwPjIrDe,2891,Eric Edelman,"And we just seem to be very passive. I mean, the President took a lot of credit for the stand-down that India and Pakistan reached, claiming that the phone calls that Vance and Rubio and others made were key to this, although the Indians have denied that. But it seems like others were actually more active than we were. And in the past, a US envoy senior person would have gone out-in Bush, 41, it was Bob Gates, the Deputy National Security Advisor-in other cases it's been the Deputy Secretary of State. But a lot of passivity on the part of this, in part because the Deputy Secretary of State was out at Dulles meeting South African, Africana refugees from the ""genocide"" in South Africa. So I mean, it seems like a very haphazard, incoherent policy in a very dangerous world. I guess we should close on that because it's such a terse statement of the problem, the challenges we face and that the country faces and the world faces, but really something we need to follow. And I mean in a funny way, not a funny way, but one has to follow a foreign policy more closely I find now than one used to, because it used to be you kind of got the basic thrust of foreign policy."
bLSSV8ApJGR,3787,Doug Sosnik,"So has there ever been a kind of more, I don't know what you'd call it, a backward looking situation? To have two massive phalanxes each being led by people more than 75. And then beneath the surface, one has the impression, and in the real country, in the real world, massive instability and fluidity in terms of where we might be going? It seems to be... It's an untenable situation, right, don't you think? Well, I'll be brief here. I don't want to go on too long. Yeah Just two things I'd say. First is, 100 years from now, when people look back at Trump and what's going on here, they're not going to be talking about Trump. What they're going to be talking about is, what was going on in America that enabled someone like Donald Trump to become president. So I think Trump is more the symptom of what's going on in the country, than the cause. And in terms of trying to explain where we are and what's going on, I'll just really quickly. We're going through the biggest transition in our country since the late 1800s, when we went from an agrarian society to an industrial society. It's a 30 or 40 year transition. In the short term you have a few winners and a lot of losers."
gWezLCaUxzk,7547,Robert Kagan,"I mean, just to really underline that point, liberalism I think is probably more antithetical to human nature than non-liberalism because it really does require a certain selflessness. I remember when, I don't know whether Frank was just quoting Hegel or what, but there's this argument that human beings crave recognition. And I think that that is true, but they crave recognition for themselves. They crave recognition for themselves and their family members and their tribe and maybe their religious group. They don't crave recognition for other people who they disagree with, who look different from them, talk differently from them, have different religious views from them. To insist on everybody's recognition is... There are very few examples of it occurring in human history. I mean, this is the thing, this is what people underestimate for all kinds of reasons, the revolutionary nature, the truly revolutionary nature of the American experiment, which is a commitment to universal rights. The English were not committed to universal rights. The French talked about being committed to universal rights, but they definitely turned out not to be. So this is the one place where this has been attempted, and I think we have enjoyed a lot of luxury. We've been a very prosperous country, we've been a country at peace. So if ever there was a place where you could have this kind of liberalism work, I think it's fair to say that the United States would be a prime contender for it."
iMGVoxXsz9Q,3242,Eric Edelman,"In other words, a deal that kind of kicked the can down the road for dealing with the Iran nuclear problem, as President Obama himself admitted. Even at the time of the deal, he admitted that when a deal expired, Iran would be days away from having the capability to build a nuclear weapon. For some of the critics, like me, of the deal, I testified actually against it in the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015, that was a really fatal flaw because I felt at the time that, although 10 and 15 years when you're signing a deal sounds like a very long time, in policy terms, it's like an eye blink. And here we are with a number of the various constraints on Iran expiring, like the ability to snap back sanctions on Iran, which will expire in October of this year. But also bans on transfer of ballistic missiles and other limits have already expired or will expire soon. So the Biden administration, their policy was allegedly to get back into a deal, but one that would be, as they put it in a Democratic platform in 2020, longer and stronger. They were unable to do that with the Iranians. They had about a year and a half of desultory negotiations. Never direct negotiations. Iranians refused to meet with the Americans directly."
OpoIaApr9Ea,5346,Tom Tugendhat,"Members of parliament are fighting two days a week, sitting in parliament five days a week, organizing soup kitchens, organizing any number of different logistical elements to make sure the war effort continues. Individuals are going around Europe quite literally at their own expense and voluntarily, but under instruction from the government to drum up support and look for help in various different ways. I mean, to say it's a whole nation effort is to understate it. It's a whole nation plus a lot of committed allies effort and it's really inspiring to watch. So how's it going? How do we stand, do you think? We're just about six, well, it's almost exactly six months. We were on a conversation together about two and a half months ago, and you were worried about the summer, obviously that Ukraine didn't make real progress and if we didn't do more to help them, they could be in not so great shape now. And then really looking at a winter where things, and we'll talk about this, can get tougher, both in terms of their own situation and their allies. But are you a little heartened? Are you worried, concerned? What heartens you? What concerns you, et cetera? Well, I mean on one level I'm heartened, there's been huge numbers of weapons deliveries to Ukraine."
yqeG8ivCrmn,20205,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
GegxnuPe4xB,7401,Robert Kagan,"Bush on the one hand, and the Democrats on the other, people like this have been complaining about the uniparty for decades. They thought it was a uniparty when Eisenhower was president, Bill Buckley was anti-Eisenhower, he called him a communist. So I think that again, these movements, they don't go away. They come up in different guises and we treat them... Like we think of McCarthyism as being fundamentally anti-communist. But it was this group, again, with Catholics added, interestingly, because they'd been on the outs for so long. And the other thing that needs to be discussed, and we can talk about this if you want to, is just the shifting attitudes of American ethnic groups so that the movement of Italian Americans, Irish Americans, and other ethnic groups, which had been a key part of the Democratic constituency, who had been enthusiastic about liberalism when it was their ancestors who were trying to climb into the American family, but over time, I think became very confident in their whiteness and basically moved to self-identify with white America rather than with the excluded ethnic groups that they had once been. Do Irish remember that they used to be in the 19th century depicted as ape-like creatures with a bottle of rum in their hands? Or how Italians were treated in America for many decades, but now they consider themselves white, and so they're willing to tolerate a white nationalist movement in the Republican Party as we see."
lhe5fv6KB8R,7478,Robert Kagan,"That's certainly what Steve Bannon says. It's what Patrick Deneen would say. And they're really opposed to America's support for liberalism overseas. And that is a big motivating factor. And I even think that the reason that they are so hawkish on China and so dovish on Europe is that China's a communist country or run by the Communist Party, and they want to insist that America is also being run by communists. Joe Biden is a communist. The Democratic Party is communist, and so they are more interested in making that linkage. I don't even know whether they would defend Taiwan, whether Trump would defend Taiwan if the Chinese attacked it. I have no reason to think that we would under Trump, but so therefore, the purpose of all this foreign policy approach is about fighting the domestic battle, finding domestic enemies. It's a pretty solid tradition that goes back to the 1930s which has been resurrected. And by the way, just as a final point, much to my amazement, there are significant figures in Trump world, like this guy, Russell Vought, who I don't really know who he is, but I guess he was head of OMB under Trump, and he's constantly being spoken of as a potential chief of staff in a second Trump term. He says explicitly, ""We want to go back to the 1920s."" They're not pulling any punches on that front."
FBvY31ZlSwz,16508,Anne Applebaum,"I can talk about that at length if you want, but we can come back to it. The main point is that it looks like because a couple of smaller parties dropped out, it looks like Merz will form a coalition. He'll form it probably with the Social Democrats who were the kind of center-left party, were their rival for many years. There are some dangers inherent in this. One of them is that a big centrist coalition... If it doesn't manage to solve problems and give the impression that it's moving forward, does make the possibility of an extremist surge in the next election more likely. The second problem is I think that the two, the far-left and far-right parties together, may be able to block some changes that Merz wants to make, including to Germany's law about debt. So they want to be able to borrow a lot of money to invest in defense basically. And they're worried. So, there are some traps in the way. But in terms of leadership in Europe, Merz will be a strong voice. He will be pro- defense. He will pro-Ukrainian. He will want to work with France and Britain and Poland and others to create some kind of new defense alliance within the various alliances. And so, I am going to be positive today and I'm going to say it's a good thing."
YaoFBTrgWs7,7695,A.B. Stoddard,"We cover White House too. But we thought it might be pretty crazy this year. So far it's been a little crazy. We'll see what happens with debt ceiling in the next couple of weeks, but maybe a little less crazy than we expected. But I mean, how much turmoil do you expect to see from Congress? From the investigations, debt ceiling, Ukraine aid votes? Or do you think maybe at the end of the day we'll look back, if we talk again in December, and say, didn't really change the dynamics of American politics. Didn't really reveal that much about either party. Or will it ... I mean, what's your guess and what's your analysis? Well, the debt ceiling debate has been so interesting, because I really assumed that Joe Biden had some kind of plan. And it would be a process, jujitsu exit ramp where he gets to say, I didn't give them spending cuts on the debt ceiling. They didn't hold it hostage. They gave me a clean debt ceiling increase, but I am in favor of clawing back covid funds and doing some things, and making these budget spending cuts in the budget and the annual spending bill. And so if there was a way to suspend it for the summer, punt it to the September fight, that's what we all kind of anticipated and that didn't happen."
SjLzR3iWUS9,15461,Anne Applebaum,"So that's not the most important difference between them and the center right. The difference is that they're pro-Russian. What struck me was that, and this is my glass half full. Since you were going in that direction, I'll go in that direction too, this morning. Which is given that 10% was their previous high watermark, so they doubled it. So that's bad. No, it was more like 14 or 15. To 14, okay. And then I guess the left, the post communist party got about six or seven. So you got a quarter plus of the electorate going for the extremes, maybe close to 30%, which isn't great. But given that they were polling at 20% already at the beginning of the campaign, six, seven weeks ago-I looked up the polls-they basically stayed where there were, despite all this intervention. Which does give me some cheer, that the German electorate was not moved by the expenditures, the propaganda, everything that people from the outside tried to do to boost the AFD higher than it started off. So there was obviously a lot of, let's call it latent extremism there in Germany, unfortunately because of- Well, to be clear, the Russian campaign in Germany is 15 years old. Yeah, fair enough. So that wasn't the recent- It's not something they built just for this moment."
iDuxwq6EDPV,5588,Tom Tugendhat,"It's a Ukrainian operation enabled with bilateral support that happens to be supplied by NATO member states. What NATO has done is it means that if you get a French artillery piece, you can fire German ammunition through it. If you get an American machine gun, you can put British ammunition into it. So, it's the interoperability that NATO has prepared, which means that the level of support we're giving is a multiplication of the efforts of individual nations. And I think NATO has done a really good job on that. And I have to say, contrary to some other multilateral organizations, NATO's caution in putting itself front and center, but instead enabling others, I think has demonstrated an extreme adeptness of touch by Jens Stoltenberg, and I think has been really very impressive. And that's sustainable. There's no reason NATO qua NATO has to be on the front line? Well, NATO is enabling organization to prepare others to enable us to operate as allies across different areas. I mean, the only specifically NATO element is the NATO Article five that was only ever once invoked, and that was after 9/11. Other than that, NATO can coordinate intelligence sharing, but actually, quite a lot of that we're doing directly. It can enable cooperation in different ways. It means that, of course, we don't need a special agreement or you don't need a special agreement to fly weapons and ammunition over French and German and British airspace, or Dutch or Danish airspace to get it into Poland."
lUvq0bfBECN,3473,David Axelrod,"Where that issue is by the convention is important. Where the war is by the convention is important. There's been a tussle in the city about where these protesters can protest and that'll be I think significant, but yeah, I'm worried about it. The convention will be an important marker. Just looking ahead six months basically, seven months, there's the conventions, July and August. Then, there's- I mean the Republican thing is going to be interesting because it could be that you have a convicted felon for the first time in American history. That'll be of interest. I'm not sure it's going to move that many votes. Although you talk about these Haley voters, they have expressed in polling a strong opinion that they won't support a candidate who's been convicted of felonies. That may be the case by that convention. They're going to have their own intrigue, but those concerns are the ones I had raised. Conventions are also an opportunity if you can handle those issues to tell the story that you want to tell. They had a brilliant convention in 2020 that was all or mostly virtual because of the pandemic, but they really branded Biden as a guy from Scranton who had good middle class values and sensibilities and economic values, who was a man of faith, who was a part of a military family."
R5UWS9tFc-d,4575,Tim Snyder,"We have many, many things we can do. No European country is even remotely set up that way. Their individual companies run, they do very good things, individual militaries that are extremely impressive, I would say, of the Balts and the Nordic states, and so forth. There are many great things. I'm not being at all... all diminishing them by comparison. It's just as a factual matter, and the degree to which we can help in sort of day-to-day conduct of the war compared to... We're set up to fight wars and to deter, and we've done quite a lot of fighting of wars, smaller ones, thank God, in the last 50 years. And obviously no European country has really. So in a very practical way, I was struck by the indispensability, if I can use a Madeleine Albright phrase, of the US, as well as the broader political way as well. But anyway, say a word, we'll close. But say a word about the US in general and what you would say to fellow Americans, or what prospects you... What worries you the most and cheers you up, if anything, the most. Well, let me just pick up where you started then I'll go somewhere else. I mean, the striking thing about us helping the Ukrainians is that we could help..."
9gnsyRPd5UM,5683,Tim Snyder,"And then you've got real problems. Again, it's like the US. You don't have to have a majority which is anti-Ukraine, but you have to have a few blockers in position, which is what Putin is aiming for and what he hopes for. Public opinion in... It's like the US. Public opinion in Europe varies from country to country, but it's basically pretty good, and it's remarkably good given that it's been two years and given that... And this has been a media discourse, which I really dislike. Given that since March of '22, too much of the media has been telling us how we need to be tired. Which is... It's kind of the worst of all possible forms of journalism, because it's not even a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's meant to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it's like now it's up to us to say, ""Oh, yeah. I read that headline and now I'm tired because I read this headline about how I'm tired."" But given all that, the public opinion is not bad. And I tend to think that... There are a lot of European countries, there are a lot of elections, some are going to go well, some go badly. The Polish election went the right way. The Czech presidential election, as you said, went the right way."
Pb68EUvP0OP,8214,James Carville,"I got to go. Yes, sir. This has been terrific, very insightful. Hopefully, I assume Vice President Harris will be watching it when we release it tomorrow when she's on the road there with Governor Walz. She has a little time. And we will get back together and see how we stand in a month, I guess. I'm confident somebody will bring it up to her. I don't know if she'll watch it, but- Well, a summary. That's what staff are for, the best of the conversation. You know? One of the great joys of this campaign is people I've worked against all my life, I've come to work with and spent time with. And watching the Olympics, and I love... One of the things about if you play sports, the good thing about running track is you see the same people all the time. When you're warming up for a race, you're actually shooting the bull with a guy. And when you play football, you just see somebody through a helmet, you don't see them. It's what I like about politics. We're kind of like track athletes. We all kind of hang out together and get to know each other and that kind of stuff. But we still- It's been a pleasure for me- -want to win. Yeah, a pleasure for me too, but let's win."
2pgUJjHwxqH,7794,Aaron Friedberg,"That seems to me highly unlikely. He's expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything. So that would be the first set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one domain has an effect on others. I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely."
Z1TMW8EPL9Q,5678,Tim Snyder,"Just one last... I want to get to action, what's likely to happen on the ground and in Russia and Ukraine and so forth in a second. But one last minor semi-political theory point, almost going back to my studies many years ago, but people my age, and I certainly was so influenced by Hannah Arendt and The Origins of Totalitarianism and the whole left-right horseshoe, they're both totalitarians, and so much in common. And there was some truth, I think considerable truth to that, perhaps. And many people wrote eloquently about it. And in that respect we did understand that there's Nazism in Soviet communism, but I think fascism's not quite the same as Soviet... it's not quite as... it needn't be maybe as totalistic, I guess you'd say, as communism was in terms of the real desire, allegedly at least, to shape people's every thought and so to speak, so forth. And I feel like there... I wish I had known more about fascism-qua fascism-and less about totalitarianism as a big concept. Yeah. And which incidentally made it seem like all fascism is Nazi Germany, which is not quite right. For me, that Umberto Eco essay, which you must know very well, from, what is it? '95 I think, Ur- Fascism, and which focuses, maybe because of where he's from, on Mussolini, as in a way, the instance... and he was really the originator of it, right?"
Q4XkFosflQy,3088,David Axelrod,"There you go. Yeah. They're already for Biden, the Bill Kristol Republicans. These Haley voters are undecided. Yeah, they are, but what were the centerpieces of her campaign? They had to do with national security issues, and that's a place where Biden should press his advantage. I so much agree with that, if I could jump in there, and I don't think they understand that. They think, look, the war in the Middle East is very difficult; Ukraine is difficult in its own, obviously, is an actual practical policy matter; and they're a little timid about making it an issue. I think I was told by someone very close to Haley herself, but to the campaign that they were surprised as they went forward at the response she got on Ukraine, NATO, Putin. They kind of thought you should talk initially about the debt and the deficit. Remember she talked a lot about that early on. Trump had been a big spender. Yeah, that was her initial thrust. Yeah. He wasn't a traditional Republican. No one cared about that. But a lot of Republicans do think we should not be pro-Putin and NATO has helped to keep the world safer than it would otherwise be for the last 80 years, and that's an issue. We're there with Biden unambiguously. It's not like some of these other issues where they're in between the two, and I feel like the Biden people could do much more to really press that a little."
900JQoJ57sQ,2140,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And you have a lot of growing support for bills like that. And so to the extent that there is a coalition out there for some sort of comprehensive immigration reform, again, people are actively working on that. And if pressure at the border does reduce, maybe, maybe you get people having those larger conversations again. But unfortunately, we are not going to fix these problems on a broader basis until we get together and compromise. And that's what I urge members of Congress to do anytime I get their ears. Stranger things can happen, I suppose, than the kind of Nixon going to China thing where Trump decides, three years in that he's solved the border and now he should do a comprehensive immigration reform. And his business friends are telling him, ""Look, we can't just kick all these people out."" I mean, I suppose it wouldn't be the- Stranger things have happened- ...Craziest outcome, but maybe not something to bet on. There was almost a deal for DACA in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall in his first term, and that was torpedoed by Stephen Miller. But does that happen again? we'll have to see. So interesting. Well, this has really been terrific, Aaron. Thank you. It's so complicated. But it's very interesting though to get a sense of the complexity of it, I think, and to see how silly a lot of the debate is, but also to really think about what..."
tepCWhGQ1OI,2728,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It's much easier for the president to stop people from entering the country- Yeah, say a word about that because of course, the famous Muslim ban in the first term was that. It wasn't removing people who were here, or it wasn't stopping people at the border particularly. I mean it was stopping people from certain countries from coming in. I guess he could do a version of that, right? Yeah, and he is almost certain that he is going to do a version of that again, as well as a potential expanded version aiming to sort of reshape who is able to come to the country. Last time he attempted to oppose essentially a wealth test on people who are coming into the country using the Muslim ban authority- that did get temporarily blocked in court. Unclear if he's going to do the exact same thing again this time around. Of course, blocking people from coming here legally is, as a administrative matter, very easy. You send a memo to consulates around the world, and you say, ""Do not issue a visa to anyone who falls within category X, Y, or Z."" And the Muslim ban authority, the travel ban authority INA section 212F, says, ""Whenever the president determines that any alien or classes of alien... That their entry would be detrimental to the United States, the president may prohibit their entry."" And so that authority can be invoked at the consulates very simply."
AsXztBM3-ZK,3222,Eric Edelman,"We're not going to do that. We're going to deal with the governments as they are,"" and et cetera. The problem is, in Syria, you don't want an inverse of what you had under Assad, which was an Alawite dictatorship over a Sunni Arab majority. You don't want now a Sunni Arab dictatorship over a country that is riven by cross-cutting cleavages of religion and ethnicity, lording it over Alawites or Christian communities or Druze communities or Kurdish communities. There has to be some pluralism, some rule of law. Otherwise, you're going to get more unrest and you're not going to get the kind of stable Syria that ought to be the objective of policy here. Yeah. So even, as you say, people can think it wasn't crazy to have outreach to Syria, to meet with the Syrian president, but whether the government will follow up with any of this, how we even... As you say, what do allies think? Yeah, that is a problem with an ad hoc personalized foreign policy, especially when so much of it seems to depend on these individual relationships, or wished-for relationships, and God knows what business things are going on. Syria is probably not quite as attractive a place as UAE or Saudi for the American companies, but I suppose there are issues there too."
Rzpk2yJs-Dc,3686,Doug Sosnik,"I kind of lost track. Eight months, something like that. Yeah, we're almost nine months away. And the longest general election in modern political history, we'll have over 60% of the country doesn't want to see either one of these people run. Yeah. What is the implication of, how does that affect everything? I feel like we don't even know quite how that, we've never really been through something quite like this, have we? No, no. Well, a little bit in 2016 with Hillary, and I'll come to that in terms of what to watch for in a moment. Okay. Good. But both right now, Biden's favorable, unfavorable, very unfavorable about the same as Trump's. So, you really have two candidates that mirror each other. So the race, I believe, if it's close, will be back to what it has been. There's six swing states that are going to determine the next President of the United States. Five of them were the ones that voted for the winning candidate in 2016 and 2020, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona. And then the sixth state that I would add is Nevada, which actually right now Trump is leading by more than the other states. And these are two states that narrowly voted for Clinton and for Biden. So we're back to the same handful of states which represent less than 15% of the US population."
MwxCOBFQfKi,7907,AB Stoddard,"It was dominant on YouTube all day. Republicans are worried about it because they said, ""What is he doing just making a speech? Well, what's that, nobody cares."" People will care and that kind of thing will travel because Democrats are just looking, the voters are looking for some kind of response, some kind of a fight. So what I'm saying is I see a pickup between January 20 and April two. It's not good enough, but I see something is building in terms of people being willing to get out there. And of course they need resources, they need coordination. They need to stop fighting, they need to stop blaming, and I think they need to actually attack Trump's assault on five different subjects a day. I mean, they can't hide from any issue. And yeah, you can't jump at the news and that's what he wants you to do. And he throws out distracting things like Greenland and so you shouldn't follow that like a dog to the bone. But why can't they, I keep thinking, do a golden era or what does he called it? ""The golden age whiteboard,"" where they every day a different person, it's AOC one day, it's a businessman, small businessman from Kansas. The next week it's Mark Cuban. The week after that it's, I don't know somebody but maybe five numbers."
VGZqeiELuay,6140,Tom Tugendhat,"And so actually, the UK has led very effectively on this. And other countries that have been ignored or rather not been noticed as much have been very important as well. Countries like Australia have been really important in supplying weapons and support to Ukraine. So there's been countries around. And of course, the US has supplied more money, more ammunition, more of everything than anyone else. And I hope that the United States will continue to not only to do that, but to do more. So I don't think we should belittle any of those that have done so much. Other countries haven't been noticed as much, but France has done an awful lot. France has supplied huge amounts of artillery and large amounts of advanced weaponry, which has been really important. Other countries have been a little slower, and the obvious one in this is Germany. And there's various reasons for that, which are pretty obvious, but there's some changes there too. I mean, Scholz leads the SPD, as you know, as well as being the chancellor. And he's managed to get German foreign policy changed pretty radically in recent months. His Zeitenwende , his sort of time of change as it were that he spoke about in February means that he's pledged 100 billion euro to German defense spending, which is, it's not nothing."
BvuCmnP_600,5983,AB Stoddard,"You have to hang together as long as you can and then break, not break first. And so that's really... it's very powerful, their inability to unite, refusal to plan for this. Maybe the law firms didn't see it coming. Obviously, the Democratic Party, in my view, completely wasted the transition and knew what was coming. But these institutions really needed to band together because that's the only strength you have is in numbers, and they didn't. So that was sort of a shock. I feel among the public... people that I speak to who are not in politics, they are anti-Trump, a lot of them, but not focused on the day-to-day. So they're seeing on their phones, phones, Elon does something crazy, four days later, they're seeing on the phones that a judge maybe stopped part of it. They're just going on with their lives. They know that prices are not going down, they don't like that. They know that the Social Security administration is no longer getting it someone on the phone with their grandfather or father. They don't like that. They don't like tariffs. They don't like, they're really focused on prices and essential services, but they're not focused, in my view yet, on the attack on our freedoms. And so they are not focused on free speech violations."
rXOzz6ix91V,19648,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
BN8y9_QZKWt,17298,Anne Applebaum,"They had many, many friends and colleagues across the military and across the US government. If General Milley to take an obvious example in 2020 had resigned, all the other chiefs would've resigned. A ton of three-star generals would've resigned. Maybe the Secretary of State would've felt he had to resign, Pompeo. I mean, the degree to which Trump has got people who have no authority or independent standing. I think your own work on autocracy has emphasized that point, and he's gone further in that direction, I guess, than even I expected. I think it's also really important to understand that this is not a conservative movement. It's not even... I wouldn't even say it's a right-wing movement. I mean, it's the wrong way to think about it. It's something... This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are not based in reality. They are skeptical of science. They're skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. And so there's a qualitative difference. You see, online, people saying, ""Oh, well, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement."" No, this is not."
9-MBHiAFMbA,3580,Eric Edelman,"What are we now four months into the second term? Do you think, Eric? Well, I agree, Bill. First, it's great to be with you again and interlocutor is a great foreign service word, so thank you. I like to make Eric feel at home here. We'll use a lot of terms about the seventh floor of the State Department, and what are démarches, that's always one of my good ones, and chargé d'affaires, that's a nice one. ""Demarshmallows,"" as some of my foreign service colleagues used to refer to them. Well, look, the pageantry was a big part of the entire kind of mise en scene that Trump orchestrated. As the coverage in the New York Times pointed out, if he'd gone almost anywhere else in the world, there would've been protests. If he'd gone to Europe, certainly if he'd gone to Canada or Mexico, which are the traditional opening trips for an American president, there certainly would've been protests. We've seen major protests break out at hockey games in Canada since the advent of the Trump administration. But he knew that going to the Middle East, where he had gone on his first trip in his first term, he would be greeted with sword dances and with, as you say, camels and Arabian stallions and red Cybertrucks and fighter escort for Air Force One and all of the trappings of power that he enjoys and the kind of adulation he requires psychologically, I think, in order to operate at a high functional level."
QEqEd3glQmr,5752,Tom Tugendhat,"Sweden's has been something for about 200 years, right? I mean, these are not sort of recent fads. These are very, very deep parts of the national identities of both countries. And the fact that both countries have decided funny enough at the same time, the time has come to abandon that position, I think is a recognition that, look, you're under threat the like of which you haven't seen before. And there is a real danger to the Swedish people, to the Finnish people and to the whole of Europe, and a change in policy is required to face it. And you also see, by the way, the same thing in responses by some of those who've been working with Russia. I mean, very famously, Gerhard Schroder was chancellor of Germany of course, and is now very, very close to Vladimir Putin. He's been working with [inaudible], he's been working with various other people. And one other person who had looked like they were going to be joining the same sort of racket as him was the former French prime minister, François Fillon. And I named them both in parliament as people we should consider sanctioning on the grounds that they are enabling the erosion of freedom in Europe. And in fact, personally, I'd describe them both as traitors to themselves and to their countries."
vgCtIseNqRF,2161,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Really at the height of ICE's power. Over a full year. Over a full fiscal year, 238,000 people. 20,000 a month. Yeah. Who were arrested. And so about 20,000 a month. To give you some sense of what that looks like, at that rate, the highest rate of internal deportations ever in US history, it would take 46 years to deport 11 million people. And right now under Biden, what will their contrast be with 2024, 2023 to make themselves look much more aggressive? Yeah, much lower. The Biden administration, I think it's around 60,000 right now. And those numbers have been rising every year of the Biden administration's term internal deportations. But again, the border diverted so many resources away from ICE. One good example of this, every one of those migrants who've entered and been put through a process, has to check in with ICE. So ICE has to now descend a lot of officers over to just do check-ins and is now hiring a bunch of staff just to assist with check-ins. So they had a lot of people whose job it was who normally would be going out and picking people up who just had to deal with the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of people who had moved to that area that needed to be processed for check-ins every day."
Zjv7yPDev-5,15585,Anne Applebaum,"And it's also not just the tariffs, tariffs being bad policy, it's the way tariffs are being used. The tariffs are being used as a bargaining chip in some cases for Trump's private interests. The Vietnamese have offered some land for a Trump golf course, maybe in exchange for having a better tariff deal. I mean, what's that about? So US economic policy, government policy is being used to personally and financially benefit the president and his family in a way that... I can't think of any precedent in American history for that. I mean, there've been corrupt presidents before. I don't know. Supposedly Ulysses S. Grant allowed his brother-in-law to get some contracts. This is on a different scale. This is US foreign policy being twisted for the benefit of the president and US economic policy being twisted for the benefit of the President, for the financial benefit of the president, as well as the political benefit. And I can't think of a precedent. Maybe your American history is better than me. No, no. I think it's very different from the normal corruption, which is a sort of particularized case of someone getting paid off so that someone gets a good deal on something. We've seen that obviously, or try to bribe people to get good regulations for your company."
VDYwVJ8tBHI,15518,Anne Applebaum,"It doesn't mean they're useless, but this is a drone war. When I first went to Kiev, I went to Kiev in April 2022, six weeks after the invasion, to interview Zelensky with the editor of The Atlantic , Jeff Goldberg. And at that time, we saw some drone workshops. And the drone workshops of that era, they were in people's garages. And literally, I mean, that summer, I went back and I saw some of this stuff and we saw it again the following year. They look like people are making drones out of cardboard and glue. I mean, literally, that's what it looks like. Fast-forward to last year. Last year, the Ukrainians in factories made one and a half million drones. And this year they're on schedule, I was told, to make four million drones. Maybe it's not that high, but it's several millions. They're making their own drones. More to the point, they have their own software. Some of it has been, they have lots of help from the tech community in the US and Europe, but there are also Ukrainians who have been designing ways to fight the war because no bespoke, excuse me, no prepared product that someone gives you from Silicon Valley, when you bring it to the frontline in Kharkiv, it doesn't work."
JI7__xT3_TQ,5268,Tom Tugendhat,"But the reality is, the nation state is back. And the nation state is back in ways that I don't think we, or other, not everybody expected. And nation states need to recognize the reality that this has implications for all of us. And part of those implications are even if you're the strongest nation state like the United States, it doesn't mean that you can stand on your own. It actually means that you have to help in ways that are perhaps not as traditional as they once were. Energy supplies are now relatively high in quite a few countries in Europe. Germany's now stocked up some 80-odd percent of their gas storage. I mean, that doesn't mean that prices are going to come down as dramatically as I think many would like, but it does at least mean that we're less likely to have complete cutoffs. But Germany is also preparing, German ministers are also preparing the German people for supply shortages, for energy-saving measures and many other things. So I think it's right to say there's concern, but people are getting prepared. Yeah, that's good news I think, and a little more optimistic. Maybe the people here there's a little bit of glass half empty, I'd say. Thinking among some of my friends here in DC, that every time there's a little hiccup or some German politician says something that's not 100% robust, they go, ""Oh my God, the Europeans are falling apart."" But I've got to say that they've done less falling apart and more hanging tough, and obviously pushed on by their neighbors, by the Eastern Europeans and Central Europeans and by you in the UK that they've hung tougher than I would've expected."
LqtIGauZUyd,3204,David Axelrod,"And so they've got to be better at that. So this national security thing, I think, is important. One thing, Bill, that I would hope they would be organizing is a show of force among former secretaries of defense, former chairman of the joint chiefs, former senior military and national security leaders of both parties to, at a strategic moment, stand up and say, ""We are Republicans and Democrats and independents. We as a practice don't involve ourselves in campaigns, but we believe that a second Trump presidency would represent a national security threat, and it would advantage the Chinese. It would advantage the Russians. It would weaken or destroy NATO. It would put ultimately our own interests at risk and our own young men and women at risk."" I mean, I think a message like that would be powerful. Yeah, no, I agree. I think people are working on that, we'll see how much they can deliver that. Let's see, what else? The Democratic Coalition, we can say a word more about that if you want the younger voters. Anything magic about... You need to both get them back, get the percentages back closer to where they were in 2020 and get them to vote also. Right. There are two problems. I think two things. I think the comparative is really important here."
QwXOXgl7J6j,6870,Aaron Friedberg,"And of course, that's not the way the world really works. So if you imagine a world in which the US pulls back its support from Ukraine, presumably our European allies might at least for some period of time try to fill that gap. And I think they've been thinking about how they could do it and whether they could do it, but I don't think anybody believes that they could in the long run do that on their own. So imagine a world in which the Russians have successfully conquered all of Ukraine. I mean, you don't have to conjure up nightmarish notions of what would happen. We've seen what happens in territory that Russia takes from Ukraine. There's mass murder, there's deportations, forced deportations, kidnapping of children, destruction of industrial capacity. It would be nightmarish, and you would have an outpouring of refugees, and you'd also have Russian forces sitting that much further to the west and on the border of US friends and allies. So the consequences in Europe and Putin emboldened, presumably, by his success, he would be able to say, ""I, just like past great Russian leaders,"" maybe he wouldn't invoke Stalin, but that's clearly who he would have in mind, ""took a punch, but we Russians don't give up, and we mobilized our industry and mobilized our people, and we won this great victory."" Does anyone think that he then is going to be content and isn't going to cast his eye to the Baltics or even cast his eye further to the west?"
lipvVSlavg8,3148,Doug Sosnik,"I don't know. Is a third party thing possible, independent candidacy possible even this year? Could the tectonic plates be totally powerful and strong until something really happens? I don't know. I just feel a little bit like that's more possible than I would've thought a few months ago. Well, I think it's more possible. Look, going back to your first point, young voters think quite differently about issues and institutions and politics than baby boomers and the Greatest Generation, and the largest population groups in America now are millennials and Gen Z, and they'll be the largest voting group by the end of the decade. And if you look at the polling and the research that's been done, Harvard's done a lot of this, where the young Republicans think quite differently than older Republicans on issues they care about, and the same with young Democrats. So I do think we'll get out of this cul-de-sac when the younger generations take over, and they're not going to be fighting the same fights we've had for the last 50 years. And over the long term, I think third party candidates can be much more viable, because when you think about all institutions that the young people have dismissed and no longer believe in, and now we put the political parties right at the top of that list."
dos4YCwtRgF,8370,Mark Esper,"But they have no authority to deploy troops to make contracting decisions, things like that. Now, I don't mean to downplay that because they have a lot of informal authority, but it's important to understand that the power is invested in civilian leaders. That's kind of the form of government that we developed over 200 plus years that said, civilian control of the military matters. And we've adhered strictly to that code, and of course that developed other norms and procedures around that to make sure that that divide, that respect, that relationship is nurtured. And that was why one of my four no's was don't politicize DOD, the military, because I didn't want that broken down between us. And look, I had a great partner in Mark Milley and fortunate, and people forget this, that he and I had served together for two years in the Army. He was Chief of Staff of the Army, and I was Secretary of the Army, so we had built up a rapport that we kind of knew how each other thought about things. We discussed issues all the time. And so having him by my side in that role during the tough days, particularly of 2020, was invaluable. And we kind of weathered a lot together during that time. Yeah, that's so interesting."
89IQhFAz7SM,6326,Jack Goldsmith,"Jim Comey actually investigated him, so there was some possible wrongdoing there, but nothing compares to what Trump did in number or abuse. Nothing compares to it. Well, let's look forward, since he's about to become president again in six weeks, and talk generally maybe. And we can go to whichever order you want. I'm sort of interested in, I think, some people, I am, are alarmed about some of the nominees. We don't need to get into that at a personal level, but how alarmed are you by what Trump, maybe leave the nominees almost aside, they've spoken too, but Trump himself has spoken so much to these issues, you don't really need to get to the nominees, by what he seems to want to do? And I'd say, unless you think there are other buckets that we should talk about, the sort of, let's call it, Justice Department rule of law side of things, and then, the Defense Department intelligence community side of things. I feel like those are two big areas where we could be pretty uncharted waters. Yes. So, I spend a lot of time trying not to be alarmed. So my general disposition is to not be alarmed and to wait until we have concrete evidence that we need to be alarmed. Because so many things in his first term that he pledged to do never came about."
hmfGv8b3jXj,2996,Doug Sosnik,"But we're still going to be in this barrel for several more cycles. And that's what Trump and Biden represents, which is our transitionary figures that as a country, politics are lagging indicators. We will never get to the other side politically until we get to the other side in terms of who we are as a country and what people care about. Once we do that, the politics will change. And that's why early the beginning of the next decade, the issues that poll well right now that don't matter in elections like climate control, gun control, abortion, all these social libertarian issues, they're going to be driving the outcome of elections next decade. Because the people that are going to be running this country care about that. And these are the emerging younger generations, but they're not quite at the tipping point yet of taking over. No, that's really well said. And I'm more hopeful, we just have to assume we make it through this rather rocky period. Bill, I'll tell you, I know we're wrapping up here. What do you say we give a speech there are three roles, that I'm sure your familiar. One is, you got to show up on time. Two is, you don't want to offend your host. And three is, you want to have them feeling better after the speech than before."
yW5tnqZK7QL,5600,Aaron Friedberg,"But at least at the outset, it's possible that you could have a Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor, who again, at least based on their expressed views, might appear to be more, how to say it? Normal or familiar Republicans. But then there's a whole other cast of characters, Steve Bannon, Rick Grinnell, Stephen Miller, who knows, who could easily emerge as important. Kash Patel, dominant figures even in parts of a new Trump administration. And those people, again, to the extent we can judge their views, are very, very different, and would be America Firsters, for lack of a better term, isolationists I would say. And they'll also be, assuming that there is another faction, they would be struggling for Trump's ear. And again, my guess would be in the end, that side of the spectrum, people with those kinds of views, traditional Democratic allies, I don't know that all of those people share Trump's personal affinity for some of the dictators that he's engaged with. But overall, these are people who are much less interested in talking about human rights or judging the quality of another regime based on its ideology and style of governance. That seems to be much more in harmony with Trump's own views. But again, we don't know. But to get back to your question, what that means is the range of uncertainty, the range of possible policies under a Trump administration is just extremely wide."
DEPnlNsXVM_,7398,A.B. Stoddard,"And again, the voters don't know that. They see on Fox that they're fighting the justice department, and they don't know that Congress can't intervene in a pending investigation, and they can't give the documents. But again, they send in the money, and Jordan gets to go home and thunder and roar. And it's worked for them. But I do think that Republicans still have a chance to very seriously overstep. But there also could be very real stuff. And I think that is potentially a problem for the Democrats But the small margin really did stop McCarthy from having to give in to the madness. It's like, we're this close, guys, to losing the house. A couple of you could get sick or die, and we're going to be back in a Democratic majority. So just holds your horses. And that's the reality. And it definitely calmed down their great and grand ambition to at least impeach Mayorkas and Merrick Garland, do a lot of whatever. And potentially Joe Biden. They're not pursuing it. Because I think they feel the very real knife's edge between having the Democrats take power again. So that's what I was expecting. I was expecting a big Republican margin that was going to buffer them, and let the crazies rule. So it's a challenge for the Democrats to respond to that, and they need to get their head around the fact that McCarthy has landed in a good spot right now."
TccnqMIBEF1,7000,Invisible Rulers,"In the conspiracy theories about us, they actually... So when I was at Stanford Internet Observatory, the same people I just mentioned, Shellenberger and Benz, came up with this theory that we had censored 22 million Tweets. And the evidence of that was in a report that we wrote. We added up the number of Tweets in the most viral stories alleging fraud in the 2020 election. And the number at the bottom of the table was 22 million. And so they highlighted it, circled it in red, screenshotted it, decontextualized it, and that was where, ""They censored 22 million Tweets,"" came from. So there is a decontextualized fact that serves as the evidence to backstop the conspiracy theory, basically. Yeah. No, that's very interesting. Conspiracy and trust, were you going to say any more on that? RENÉE DIRESTA: Oh, yeah. I was supposed to remind you. I'm dutifully doing my job here. I'm very... Yes. RENÉE DIRESTA: No, the trust point is exactly that, right? It is that we live in very different universes at this point, where if you... Because eroding confidence in institutions and repositioning yourself as the source of authority and trust is good business for somebody who's trying to sell Twitter or Substack subscriptions or whatever. That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else."
5EHvkJLx7F5,2192,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Don't let that many people in."" So what Trump is going to do is going to make it harder to access the asylum process legally at ports of entry. We know he's going to enter into international negotiations with a wide variety of countries to take migrants with Mexico, to potentially restart the Remain in Mexico program, with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to restart the so-called Asylum Cooperative Agreements, which were a sort of roulette system where if you were Guatemalan, they would send you to Honduras or El Salvador. If you were Salvadoran, they would send you to Honduras or Guatemala, and if you're Honduran, they would send you to Guatemala or El Salvador. It was a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose kind of circumstance. And also with the Honduran deal, they would also send you there if you were Mexican, Brazilian, or Ecuadoran. It was part of the deal they worked out, though that never actually went into effect. This was a way diplomatically to get other governments basically, other nations to take immigrants and keep them out of the US. Yeah, that's right. And the Trump administration pitched it at the time as a migrants should apply for asylum closer to home. That was completely made up. There was no requirement that you be anywhere from those, that you've ever been in one of those other countries."
2T7y9GiFtdP,5813,Jack Goldsmith,"Yes. It's fine. It's fine. So Jack, thanks for joining me again. Thank you, Bill, for having me. We're talking here, what is it, December, just the 11th, 2024 about the presidency, the rule of law, the institutions, the guardrails, all these issues that are pretty front and center. I guess we should begin maybe a little bit with the forest rather than the trees. Now, I do want to get into two places you actually worked in government and sort of help explain to people the implications of the situation we're in and what might happen in justice and the legal side, you might say, of the government and the defense department and the intelligence community. But first, give me a... You wrote that book four years ago , Reconstructing the Presidency . How stands the presidency? We want a strong president. We want a law-abiding president, more or less. Those things are intention. How are we doing that? I'm with Arthur Schlesinger Junior who said, ""We need a strong presidency, but a strong presidency accountable under law,"" and those two things need to go together. My view is that given the modern world, given foreign dangers and domestic complexity, and really the nature of the Constitution as it was set up, vigorous presidential leadership is vital to make the Constitution work."
FW84jX3-L8s,2396,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"The big shift really began under the Obama administration as more people began leaving El Salvador and Honduras, as MS-13 became ascendant in those countries and started recruiting young children for their gangs and taking women forcefully as ""girlfriends"" with no choice. You know, if you don't be my girlfriend, I kill your family. And a lot of parents started sending their kids to the US. The message got out that this was an accessible way to seek safety. And I think that knowledge has spread. Now different smuggling groups have arisen as well that can help share misinformation and sometimes truths about the border. So the knowledge that is a pathway to seek asylum in the United States is more widely spread than it has ever been, but the pathway itself is not new. So how many people are coming across the border, have come across in the last year or two, are coming across now, and what has Trump propose to do about this? Something you still consider is a big problem, even if the numbers are way down from where they were a year ago. Yeah, so a year ago, the situation was very different. In December of 2023, we saw 250,000 border patrol apprehensions, the highest number on record. I will note as a little bit of a historical aside, it's not clear if that actually is the highest number of people who've ever crossed in a given month because 20, 30, 40 years ago, we had far less situational awareness of how many people were crossing."
BQquuvejaxL,8123,AB Stoddard,"They were worried about him, but they didn't really go to the mattress on it. And then suddenly now it's like, oh my God, he's our worst fears. I mean, are we sufficiently appreciative of the fact that this lunatic is the secretary of HHS and is not, contrary to what people sort of thought, has not pulled back at all? And I mean, I'm a little freaked out about this. I have sort of secondary family relations, mostly on Susan's side, in medical and research science world. And I actually know some people in that world too from around here and New York, and I mean, this is bad, they think. And they're not hysterics. And incidentally, a lot of them have been critical of NIH... It's a bureaucracy, they don't always fund the right things. They have the usual gripes you have with big government agencies, but the degree of damage that's being done, and maybe voters don't understand if research on Parkinson's gets slowed down or eviscerated because you don't see the effect, exactly. You know what I mean? You don't see the progress that's not made. It's not like social security office being closed, but I really wonder how much that's going to percolate out through sort of Republican-ish voting groups, right? Physicians, executives and pharma companies."
DhjWF-CHKom,7461,Robert Kagan,"He says explicitly, ""We want to go back to the 1920s."" They're not pulling any punches on that front. They want to go back to 1920s with the troika of isolationism, protectionism and anti-immigration, hostility to immigration. So the lines are clear, much more than I would've even ever expected between the straight line from America First to the 1930, really, 1942, to where we are today. Just one footnote on China. Yeah, that's very interesting that they are tied together by anti- liberalism to bring us full circle. I mean, in China, I just feel, I don't think they would actually fight for Taiwan. B, China was always an object of American nativism, back to the original restrictionist immigration legislation, obviously, and with the 1880s, I think, Chinese Exclusion Act. Yeah, that too. Yeah. And it is communist sort of, so they can sort of pretend to be anti-communist easier than being anti-Putin, I guess. But I think it's also, don't you think, just, Americans have... There's enough embedded now since World War II that we should be opposed to someone out there in the world, some bad guys, that they can't just be what I suspect they would be if they really were candid, which is they don't care about any of this stuff abroad. They want absolutely to defend us."
b80ArXfFgpM,6457,Jack Goldsmith,"And yeah, a lot depends on what you... Is this just to implement policies the president has the right to implement? We should come to Congress in a minute since we haven't even mentioned Congress, which probably has some checking and oversight roles. But is it to implement these policies that are genuinely within the president's discretion or genuinely just lawful and haven't been implemented much for various reasons or effectively. Or is it putting various thumbs on the scale in terms of everything from in a Richard Daley, Tammany Hall way of contracts and so forth, to a more complicated kind of politicization where one goes beyond what the normal, you might say willing ability? I was thinking, so you were at the Defense Department in 2002 as, I think, counsel to the general counsel. And then you came over to run the Office of Legal Counsel, a very important office of the Justice Department in 2003. And famously reversed the previous memos of your predecessor and got in some pretty big fights with people in the White House and so forth, that you wrote about in the book. I mean, I don't know, it must have been something to go through that. I mean, you capture that a bit in the book. But I do feel like that is somehow healthy maybe, somewhere between- Yeah, I agree. ... you don't have to have shouting matches with the vice president or chief of staff, or whatever you had with that."
T0P-ATgc8yv,3627,Eric Edelman,"He said, ""But you guys have to remember, I'm the one who did it. It was me personally."" So it's very hard to really get after these numbers. To give you one, for instance. In the Saudi portion of the trip, the fact sheet talks about $142 billion in arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Now, when he went on his first trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, they announced a 110-billion- dollar arms package, not all of which came to fruition. There have been questions that have already been raised about, well, exactly 142 billion's a lot of money for even the Saudis. Saudi defense budget is roughly 70 billion a year. So $142 billion is two year's worth of their defense budget. Byron Callan, who was a close observer of the defense industry and defense trade, has calculated that if you look out a decade and you factor in 3% annual real growth into the Saudi budget, 142 billion would be roughly 15% of what the Saudis spend over 10 years. Is that a reasonable wag at what the US might anticipate it would secure in arms sales? Yeah, probably. Maybe. And would that be a good thing? Yes, that would be a good thing because it'll tie the Saudis closer to us and allow us to have more influence."
mzcLMriI82a,7616,Robert Kagan,"So Blacks are moving into Democratic Party in the thirties, and so when you emerge from World War II, you have what is going to become a national resorting. The Southern anti-liberals gradually break from the Democratic Party. They formed the Dixiecrats in 1948, but then they also ultimately vote for George Wallace. He's sort of the conveyor belt. And then they gradually move into the Republican Party. And Chris Caldwell, who used to work at The Review at The Weekly Standard , but he wrote an article in the 1990s complaining about the southern captivity of the Republican Party because it was true. If you looked at the leadership Republican Party in that period, it was largely Southern. And so whereas as you say, you had once had the anti-liberal forces pretty evenly divided between the two parties, you had Republicans representing sort of white Protestant, upper upper middle class America, traditional Christian Protestant attitudes, and then you had the South, which [inaudible] the Democratic Party. Over the course of the post-World War II period, all the anti-liberal forces-and the turning point, I think, is probably the Reagan years-all the anti-liberal forces start moving into the Republican Party, leaving the Democratic Party with no anti-liberal essentially, except for the anti-liberals on the left, which we can talk about some other day."
v1y6FxdyTKy,6959,Invisible Rulers,"Or could we be having a different social media right now? RENÉE DIRESTA: We could and we can. So yes, to some extent they do. But it's not Mark Zuckerberg in a room cackling with his finger on the ""I'm going to make it negative"" button in the way that it's sometimes kind of cartoonishly described. It's more- Sometimes cartoons are somewhat accurate, though. Sorry... RENÉE DIRESTA: I think... well, I don't know. I imagine you remember... Remember the ISIS days on Twitter? I feel like we kind of forget 10 years ago, but in 2014 timeframe, ISIS got very big on Twitter, speaking of propaganda. It was one of the first terrorist organizations that realized that this gave it a way to recruit, it could reach disaffected people. And it was very, very, very effective at propagandizing. It had an iconography. It had the black flag. It was very... Transmitting this powerful sort of brand that they built. I don't mean the beheading videos, I mean the sort of the video game-like ads that they would put out. And Twitter really struggled with it, with what to do about it. And I didn't struggle with it. I was like, ""Why aren't they taking it down?"" I felt like it was morally clear. But they saw it as like, ""Well, it's a global platform."
e4qRjoF1kDd,9257,James Carville,"Bill Clinton thinks, if I can just get in front of the bank president, I can convince him. Sir, you're not going to convince him. Guy's been a Republican since before he was born, okay? And I think Trump has that... I'd hate to equate anybody with Trump, but I think he's got that kind of salesman optimism about him. If you just get me in front of these people, ""the Blacks, they love me."" Yeah. And again, it only has to work with like one out of 20, right? It's not like he has to convince massive numbers. Yes. We're dealing in a universe of fairly small tolerances here. There's some sort of custom to taking a porn trip and your approval goes up 5%. That'll convince you. The things we talked about, they just don't, they don't happen anymore. I guess the one thing that will happen, maybe we can close in a minute on this, I thank you for taking all this time, is I guess he will make a VP pick. That's traditional. Do you have any view on both what Trump's going to do and should do? It's one of the few things that's going to happen this summer that's actually different. What he's going to do on what? The vice presidential pick for Trump."
wVGv2YiNNJu,7476,AB Stoddard,"So there's a lot of things I see them pulling their punches on, which is ridiculous. And I get their liabilities, their political liabilities, they're hamstrung by a lack of leader. We just see at this point AOC and Bernie having these events, which is great. Going out and trying to build on energy is great. Cory Booker goes down in history Tuesday night, finishing a 25 hour filibuster on the Senate floor to break the record of Strom Thurman and Ted Cruz in an epic event that I think will really produce a lot more energy. I mean, you lead by example. He's not a presidential candidate, he's not in leadership in the Senate, but what he did was so inspiring. He spent the entire time talking about the Trump administration and the damage it's doing. He didn't read Green Eggs and Ham , he didn't do any dances. I mean, it was all seriously substantive and directed at what's going on. It got more than 400 million likes on TikTok, which means people from around the world were watching it. It was dominant on YouTube all day. Republicans are worried about it because they said, ""What is he doing just making a speech? Well, what's that, nobody cares."" People will care and that kind of thing will travel because Democrats are just looking, the voters are looking for some kind of response, some kind of a fight."
5d0r6z1Mo2o,2532,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That their entry would be detrimental to the United States, the president may prohibit their entry."" And so that authority can be invoked at the consulates very simply. The president signs an executive order saying, ""No one from Afghanistan is allowed to come to the United States on a visa."" And voila, all [Afghans] internationally are barred from ever getting a visa. And that is pretty easy to administer from a consular perspective as opposed to enforcement of course, which gets into all of those complex resource questions. With the legal immigration system, you can just cut off entire categories of immigration quite easily. We also expect him to take a hammer to the legal immigration system by imposing dramatic increases in red tape. Some of this was the so- called extreme vetting the first time around where they sort of ran everybody's file and application through multiple additional layers of vetting, which slowed the process down significantly. And others will be through essentially deliberate pitfalls built into the system to make it harder to get some form of status. And the best example of this is something called the No Blank Spaces policy from the first time. The No Blank Spaces policy was a policy where when you submitted an application for asylum or for what's known as a U visa (it's a visa for people who've been victims of serious crimes in the United States and cooperated with police), what they said is, ""If you do not write N/A in every single blank box on the form, including the totally irrelevant blank boxes, we will automatically reject your application and send it back to you and make you refile it."" So that would mean, for example, if you had no middle name, your name was John Smith and you didn't write N/A in the middle name column, they would send it back."
9z2N-4JKpSI,2580,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It's unclear what that actually means. But they'll both be in the White House doing immigration policy. Yeah, exactly. And Stephen Miller has talked in really apocalyptic terms about these changes here. He's talked about deputizing National Guard troops to round people up, building detention camps in the desert or in various parts of Texas, where they send thousands of people at a time, ramping up deportation flights, and building new staging facilities using military planes, maybe sending Red State National Guard troops into blue states to carry out enforcement operations. And so that looks very different from what the system currently looks like. And then you have Tom Homan, who's a career immigration enforcer. He started off in his career in immigration enforcement, has been working on that for many, many years, knows the system inside and out. And while he also talks in sometimes bombastic terms about these operations, he's also very careful to talk in terms of what legally they can do. And to emphasize that, he said on 60 Minutes , ""I don't like the term raids. We do targeted operations."" And so he has talked about really what ICE does already, like we saw this week in Bakersfield in California, which was actually a border patrol operation. But that operation, new numbers have come out in the last couple of days."
oliyi4u50VX,9786,Mark Esper,"He certainly hasn't shown much instinct to go back towards, let's say, the Mark Esper, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence view of the world, and more of an instinct to double down on America First, and it's different, whatever that means, but it's different iterations. Don't you think, like the allies especially? Well, I've said this before, I talk about it in my book, and I think it's apparent now. When you see the polling, there are a lot of Republicans who want to see Trump reelected because they recall more favorable times than what they're seeing today. The Trump Administration pursued policy objectives that were consistent with what a lot of former conservative Republicans would've pursued as well, a conservative court, deregulation, lowering of taxes, an aggressive foreign policy. Trump sought to rebuild the military and did so for the first two or three years, securing the border, things like that. The challenge was that too often he would go too far. Look, I completely agree that we should push the allies in Europe, and Asia, by the way, to spend more on defense, to do more. But you don't go so far as to threaten to undermine NATO or to pull out, things like that. So again, I think in many cases his instincts were right. There were accomplishments during that administration, but there were guard rails in place, guard rail number one being the prospect of reelection, and number two being the people he brought in around him."
oiKWAKRX4ot,6568,Invisible Rulers,"They're like, ""Why are we publishing these idiots,"" is basically the response. So you do see that frustration. Like, ""Why are these people not deferring to my authority,"" is sort of the response even back then. But I think the challenge that we face now is that... So I was talking about creation and distribution as these two separate things. Anyone can be a creator now. Anyone can be influential. Anyone can develop relationships. Anyone can say anything they want. And this is not inherently a bad thing, right? Because propaganda, for all of the writing on it from the '20s through Chomsky in the '80s, writing about the propaganda of hegemonic media, like selling wars to the public and stuff. This is where you start to see that challenge of institutional media getting it wrong or institutional media carrying water for the government, and this was what the internet was supposed to not do. That was the vision, that we would finally have this media that was independent, this way to get better information to the people. And instead, what happened, unfortunately, is that... Speaking of Wall Street sayings, there's that Charlie Munger one, ""Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes."" And that's where you see, again, the incentives of social media unfortunately start to turn to all of these influencers who maybe start out as just sort of plucky people wanting to tell their vision of the truth to the world, eventually begin to..."
XcgYOXG7JlI,5018,Tim Snyder,"I think that's really where we... that's our real problem. It's not anybody else, the problem is us. Yeah. And certainly someone like me who'd been on the conservative side, I feel like I've personally learned a ton about... and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and everything. But still, about the south and the reconstruction. And it's been useful... not useful. I hate to say it that way. It's a terrible, bad history and terrible to have to relearn it under these circumstances. But really looking at what happened in between, I don't know, 1870 and 1900 or something in the south, and the combination of using the laws and changing the laws, and then the extralegal militias and so forth. It's very reminiscent of... I think there the American exceptionalism led us wrong, too. We had blinkers on about some of that. Yeah. Well, I think folks who were coming to political maturity in the late '60s can say, ""Okay, now we've got this right."" Right. Yeah. ""We're on the right side of civil rights and we've..."" yeah. If we fix it, it's all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately. But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is connected to the America First stuff."
hhW4I-ZyW-N,5173,Aaron Friedberg,"Suddenly the Saudis, I think get less interested in a defense deal with us and more interested in their own nuclear program conceivably, right? They might be friendly with Trump and they're busy giving money to his family and all this, so maybe they could buy them off short term, but I guess that's the thing. Don't you think that you can imagine short- term scenarios where nothing falls apart in the next six or 12 or 18 months, and Trump might have personal reasons for being friendly to MBS, so even there's no immediate movement on that front, or same you might say for Israel incidentally. But longer term, what's the reliability of the US under someone who has shown the willingness to be as, I guess, I don't know, what, cavalier about our commitments as Trump? I don't see how foreign leaders could not worry about the possibility that they too could find themselves in a situation where the United States was not there when they needed them, whatever the stated policy of a Trump administration on that issue might be. And then they have to ask themselves, well, what can we do to take care of ourselves? Because they're not just going to give in to their enemies, presumably. Maybe we can get to this, but one of the things that I find frustrating, I guess, about the discussion on foreign policy alone and the comparison between a notional Harris administration and a notional Trump II administration, is that it tends to ignore a whole set of other problematic issues, which arguably are more domestic or internal that would arise I think under a Trump administration, which would raise deep questions about the stability of our political system and of the fragmentation of our society, and that's the foundation on which American power ultimately rests."
0qpNUq0_kzE,2433,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So there will be legal challenges over those regulations. And if Congress doesn't pass any changes into law, they will be subject to being tied up in the courts, potentially. That said, there is a population of around 1.5 million people who have already been ordered deported. And if those people are arrested, the timeline between arrest and being put on a plane could be very quick, a matter of days. The problem is, a lot of these people, ICE does not know where they are. They are people who missed a court hearing at some point in the last decade or two decades and are living in the country, God knows where, that ICE is going to have to go out individually and find every one of those people and pick them up. There is also a smaller version part of that population that is already checking in with ICE, once a month or a couple of few times a year and have been granted some form of administrative stays. The government has said, ""Look, we agree it wouldn't be in our best interest to deport you right now, so we're not going to do that."" That can be taken away immediately, and they can very rapidly deport people in that circumstance. And they did this during the first term too."
qO999aU0CfF,5745,Tim Snyder,"That can obviously sustain a war for a while, and it has sustained a war for longer than I think a lot of people expected. I think things are going quite badly for Russia, and I think the way that the only place they're really winning is in the American mind. Not just the American mind. The only place they're winning is in people's heads. They're not really winning on the battlefield. They've smartened up from their initial invasion, which was based on this entirely false political premise. But they're still losing an awful lot of men in order to take a relatively small amount of territory, and they're doing badly, as we talked about before, in the air and on the sea. Politically, I'm not really sure what their explanation is for going on for another year. I think they've plateaued. They've hit this plateau, where Russians think the war makes sense because people have died. It's precisely that. Because my son has died, because my husband has died, because my brother has died, there must be some reason for it. That will keep you going for a while, but it won't keep you going indefinitely. I think they're going to have a hard time getting to 2025, and that's why they're so heavily invested in us right now."
WwL7wj4vBPO,3696,Eric Edelman,"It's really an example of what happens when the US vacates the region and creates a vacuum. And it's I think not a terribly comfortable situation and one which if I were an Israeli, I'd be very worried about. This has been so interesting and so helpful to really think in a serious way about something that... Trump's speeches don't help, let's put it this way. Thinking about whatever people might be doing in the background and the press coverage, understandably, is sort of very episodic and focuses on wherever he happens to be in one day. So two final things that I think are pretty big though. How worried, what about Israel and Iran? I mean there's certainly been talk for months that Israel sees a window of opportunity. This is the moment. Finally, Iran is weaker because Hezbollah has weakened, Iran itself weakened in those exchanges with Israel during the Biden administration where the Biden administration did quite a lot to help Israel, actually. And so this is the moment Netanyahu, he's been warning about Iran forever, and this is the moment he'll act. Is that possible in the next few months? How does that fit into the whole US/Israel relationship and so forth? That's number one. And then number two, we do just have this phone call, I guess yesterday we're speaking here on what Tuesday the 20th of May, between Putin-a two-hour phone call- Putin and Trump."
FHQ_IIRTNUe,8660,A.B. Stoddard,"Where the Democrats were going to, as it were, win the congressional fight writ large. I wouldn't say that's exactly happened. I think the most, the craziest Republicans have popped off, but it's been a one or two day story. The investigations haven't really done a great damage, but they haven't been humiliating, I wouldn't say, to the Republicans yet. I don't know, tell me what you think. You cover it. But I do think it's a weird, it's an interesting, contrarian story so far. I think what's interesting is what has allowed, well again, we don't know entirely what's allowed Kevin McCarthy to succeed, besides the fact that he works it really hard internally. But in terms of Ukraine funding, he spoke out strongly in support of Ukraine when we least expected it a few weeks ago, right after Tucker was pulled off the air. And I think that bodes well for the fact that there's still support among the donor class, and much of the elected elites, for supporting a fight against Vladimir Putin, the invader. And that is a good thing. I think that once Kevin McCarthy figured out that it wasn't a wave, and it wasn't a slaughter. And he didn't have enough seats to impeach Joe Biden. I mean, I think with a big margin he would've been under serious pressure to do so."
7M6n78dcShu,5995,Aaron Friedberg,"And that may be part of the Israeli calculation. They may have come to the conclusion that really, for various reasons, the Iranians either can't or won't take direct, escalatory steps. And what the Israelis are doing to Iran's surrogates is, among other things, humiliating to the Iranians and diminishes their perceived power in the region. And from Israel's point of view, that has to be a good thing. Well, I suppose Iran could wait and take retaliatory terrorist actions and so forth as opposed to direct military actions. Yes. They have enormous capacity, as we know from the past to do that kind of thing. And they may yet. And then just on our actions, it's a reminder that the War on Terror isn't over, and that unfortunately because of Afghanistan, perhaps in part, that the al-Qaeda and ISIS, they never fully went away and they seem to reconstituting themselves. So again, a reminder of that side of the challenge as well, I suppose. Yes, and it's quite possible that the United States could become even more of a target, in part, because of what's been going on in U.S. support for Israel. That doesn't seem to have happened directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we're going to see this problem grow and take different forms, but it isn't going to go away."
5wwKRsPWyQc,5353,Larry Summers,"You've seen an awful lot of things come and go. You've seen a lot of presidents make policy mistakes and we pay a price for those mistakes, but that price is whatever it is, point something percent of GDP or something else. But a couple of weeks ago, you talked about your genuine alarm at what was happening in the markets. You said what not quite as scary as the financial crisis or right after the pandemic. But the next thing to that, and that was particularly rocky week for the financial markets when the tariffs had been put on and not yet partly taken off. But I'm really curious in asking you this sort of, as much as a former Secretary of the Treasury and NEC head, as economist, which is why your alarm got me alarmed. It's not just a matter of economics. You've been in government, you know how these things work. So how alarmed should we be at the moment? What alarmed you the most? I think there's a set of short term financial concerns, a set of medium term economic concerns and a set of longer term systemic concerns. And they're each very serious in their own way, so maybe let me take them in sequence. There are different patterns with which markets trade. There's a classic bastion pattern, which is the pattern that I associate with the United States."
IQhdjYCg6A2,7254,James Carville,"Make us like you. We're open to it. We're on a date here and we like you going into it, and try not to pick your nose. What I'm saying is she needs more definition because people really do not know her, and I think she has a chance to do that. I also think she should come out with some policy prescriptions. If it's just you want Biden or you want Trump, that's not going to inspire people. I experienced... I want to push forward. There's a guy I would recommend [inaudible], I read it this morning... Ezra Klein, who I think is a very bright guy. Democratic Senator of Hawaii, Brian Schatz, I think is... She ought to listen to him. I know it's not a swing state, but you ought to give a guy a call because he's actually got some pretty good ideas, I thought. Anything that she can do with cost of living, affordability, that's all gold. Mine that gold. Just a couple of more things, they don't have to be radical or anything like that. Can be common sense, mainstream left of center, I guess you would say, kind of ideas. People like that. She can start with the extension of the tax cuts on incomes over $400,000 that are going to expire next year."
e_Duv7QLIny,2211,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined today by Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an expert on immigration policy, and we're going to talk about immigration policy, a centerpiece of Donald Trump's campaign and probably of what he will announce next week in his first days, in the first days of his presidency. Aaron has been at the American Immigration Council for several years, one of the preeminent, maybe the preeminent think tank and advocacy organization on immigration policy. He's a genuine expert on it-I've learned a lot from him in various sessions-and a lawyer as well, so we won't hold that against you for the purposes of this conversation, Aaron. So, we're going to talk about immigration, what's going to happen? It's been such a centerpiece of the campaign, and it will be of our politics at our public debate for the next several months maybe. It has been for a long time too, so really this is a real chance, I think, to get a good briefing on immigration policy. So, Aaron, thank you. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for having me. No, no, my pleasure. So, it was big in the campaign, and then Donald Trump has said, his lieutenants have said, big announcements coming right away and a lot of them on immigration policy."
6ebtGGk_8kB,5762,Larry Summers,"Obviously the economics of the rest of the seventies remained choppy to say the least. And it ultimately took whatever it took with Volcker and all this. But one thing that's really striking, leave aside post 2028 and how much of the damage remains, and I think that's a real concern. But also Donald Trump or Donald Trump only if he's in good health, if not JD Vance, will be president for the next three and three-quarter years. So it's not as if... you don't have that sort of... I mean that was a one-year shock in a certain way in '73, '74 here. Here, it's not only self-administered, which is worse presumably, but also that's where I guess I get also so worried. Various practical decisions the Trump administration made might ameliorate some of these conditions over the next month or two or three, but will people abroad or people at home for that matter who are investing in building plants and so forth, keeping money in US treasuries as opposed to other countries. They feel like this is, ""We're fine for the next three years."" Three and three-quarter years is a long time. I guess that's my... I really have come to this a hundred-day stuff. We're speaking here on, what is it, April 28th and it's almost a hundred days of the year, and it was a hundred days."
_eb8604KAfj,6164,Aaron Friedberg,"You mentioned the thing about personality, just to take one example, some people who are making the case for Trump say, ""Well, he would be a consistent friend of Israel, and the Biden administration has put pressure on Israel,"" and there is truth in that. And we can talk about whether that's the right thing to do or not, but what is the basis for Trump's supposed affinity for Israel? I mean, it seems that it has to do with his affinity for a particular leader of that country for various reasons. And if that leader is gone and he's replaced by someone who's different or comes from a different party, is Trump going to have the same attachment to that leader and be willing to back that leader no matter what? I don't see any reason for believing that. Because again, Trump's view of the world and his policies seem to be rooted very much in these personal judgments. And those personal judgments seem to have to do almost entirely with how those people treat him and how they talk to him and whether they flatter him. That's not the foundation for an enduring American grand strategy, to the contrary. That's awfully well said, that last one. You really put together I think one of the fundamental problems with Trump."
lm9fzm6JHU4,2204,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It's going to be a much more difficult time for you."" And that really has, I think, is in a nutshell how the Biden administration has, by 2024, come to think about the border, as their goal is to incentivize using these alternate legal pathways and disincentivize people from crossing illegally. So Trump wants to end that? That app. Yeah. He's always complaining about that app. So therefore what? So people no longer have the opportunity to go through this legalized process, you might say, to request asylum. Yeah. And the goal of the Trump administration would be to essentially reduce all migration to zero, and including people who are seeking asylum without breaking any laws, including people who come to ports of entry. We actually saw this a lot during his first term. You had then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen telling members of Congress that migrants should go to ports of entry and seek asylum. And standing at the White House podium, making a plea to migrants, saying, ""Go to ports of entry."" And then behind the scenes, signing memos to CBP, telling them, ""Limit access to asylum at ports of entry. Don't let that many people in."" So what Trump is going to do is going to make it harder to access the asylum process legally at ports of entry."
cQJCUL1J8mw,6875,Invisible Rulers,"But you can do a little bit more to be out there and say, ""This is what we know right now. Our information can change tomorrow. Here is how we are thinking about this particular crisis in this particular moment."" The other thing though is that, per your point a little bit earlier, the doctors have to get it right. And the influencers, if they don't get it right, nobody actually ever holds them to account. Occasionally, someone will make a screenshot and be like, ""Is this you with your stupid take that was completely wrong?"" But that doesn't actually often happen in any material way, because it's very tribal at this point. And with the conspiracy theories in particular, one of the reasons that... So institutions are both not particularly well adapted to the moment, and not particularly... They're trying now, they're starting to get a little bit better at it. You're seeing this in some of the emergency responses to the fires and things like this. You're seeing them start to come out and push back a lot more directly, realizing that it doesn't do any good if social media opinion is formed and solidified, and then you give your fact check two days later. So you're seeing them start to shift. But what was happening there was, the conspiracy theory would start, and people who trust the influencer, the influencers in that particular conspiratorial universe are constantly emphasizing that the institutions are corrupt, wrong, and just full of it."
v8IC5v1fapd,7681,A.B. Stoddard,"In the CNN in town hall, he was having an absolute blast because he's a showman, and as Mike Murphy tweeted, ""It was open mic night for him."" So once he realized they were laughing and applauding, he called everybody stupid. And he was really relishing, just letting it all hang out. And he knew that they were easy laughs. So he was really on fire. But it is true that he also knows, like you said, Bill, I think when to pull back, and DeSantis' Disney thing now looks like this kind of weird fetish where people are wondering, what's wrong with you? Can you just move on to something else? So it's weird. DeSantis could just be talking about lockdowns, and he could even be talking about vaccines to try to jam Trump. But instead, he wants to talk about all these bills that they're going to do in Florida to stop this and that, and only talking about Trump's record. So it's easy for Trump, I think, as you said, to just have a couple of things he hits over and over. But what struck me about the CNN Town Hall was that his lies, they were coming so fast and he wasn't the least bit sheepish about them. And it's a tool for dominance. We've watched him now, it's my eighth year of watching this up close, and it definitely has changed."
WHDhF18o8LX,6466,Jack Goldsmith,"I was very encouraged by that, but we'll see. You're absolutely right, it's very important. It's the next level of jobs. There was a column in The Journal about this couple of days ago, I think by... I can't remember who it was, but that it's the next level job political appointees that are so important and that we'll learn a lot from about how law-abiding they're going to be. But let me just close, if we're closing, by emphasizing that there's going to be a lot we can't anticipate. The Trump people have been studying these esoteric rules like the Vacancies Act, and the Empowerment Control Act, and FACA, and the Anti-Deficiency Act. These laws that no one has heard of that really get to the guts of how the government is organized and run. And I'm quite confident that they're going to try to use those laws in an imaginative way to assert unprecedented control over the Executive Branch. My own view is it's their prerogative to try because they've got good arguments on some things and plausible arguments that can be litigated on the other, and this is what presidents do, but we'll see how that works out. We'll also see if the anarchic approach to governance is going to work out for them and if they're going to have enough great lawyers to litigate all these cases to craft these laws in the right way."
Ul4_MTuqRPZ,7835,Robert Kagan,"And so I think we have to accept that people are not just stumbling, blindly following Trump. There is a real movement, a very powerful movement, that supports Trump, that really would like to see a change in the way America operates. And that movement has American roots, not just... and here's where I guess maybe the fascism term conveys Europe, rightly or wrongly I suppose. And that seems to be the argument you're making, is there are real American roots to this anti-liberalism. So many historians, and you discuss this, have written about the liberal tradition in America. I was certainly brought up on a lot of those books in college. And some of them, they're very interesting and important. But I guess this gets to the Again in your title. There's an anti-liberal tradition in America as well. Right. And let me just say a word about fascism. I think the problem when you say, ""Fascism,"" is you think of people who speak German and have mustaches or people who speak Italian and make the trains run on time. But fascism is the malady of popular government, of a popular era. You're not going to have a dictator claim divine right in most cases. They're not going to establish a monarchy in what has become a popular age, certainly since the early 19th century."
QjjgBOWT5vW,4958,Aaron Friedberg,"There are all kinds of issues with that. It's not something that's going to be easy to do, but I think of that as an alternative to what I see either a Trump administration or a Harris-Biden 2.0 administration from being inclined to do, although maybe it's closer to the latter. Trump's position is tariffs are great. He continues to talk about how the tariffs have raised all of this money. Well, it's mostly come from domestic consumers and producers who have to pay higher prices. And he wants to impose a, he says, a 60% tariffs on all exports from China, but also he wants to impose 10% tariffs on all imports from all around the world, so including from our friends and allies. So whatever else it might do, this would exacerbate differences between ourselves and our closest friends and allies. And we went through a minor version of this when the Biden administration began the Inflation Reduction Act. Subsidies, and the Europeans found that they were left out. And according to at least some reports that high officials in the Biden administration, perhaps joking, said, ""Oh, we didn't mean that, but we sort of forgot about you,"" and they've done things to try to fix that. But the course of action that Trump proposes would be one that would, I think, isolate the United States from the people that we need to collaborate with in dealing with China economically and from dealing with Russia and these other problems strategically."
2AfmFl4R-ot,3688,Eric Edelman,"Apparently in the phone call that the Europeans had with Trump after his phone call with Putin, they were stunned that he is unwilling to sanction Putin. To me, this is Lucy with the football in Peanuts . I mean, they haven't been paying attention for the last decade because if there's anything we know about Donald Trump, it's that for whatever reason he does not want to put pressure on Putin or put sanctions on Putin. He agreed to the CAATSA sanctions when he was president only because it was a veto proof majority. He's always been slow to apply sanctions or unwilling to apply sanctions. There's been all this huffing and puffing from Vance and Rubio about we might get tired and ticked off, we might sanction Russia or we might just walk away from all this. Trump seems to have suggested it after his call with Putin that he's walking away. He's just going to let the Ukrainians and Russians deal with this and it's a European problem, not our problem. That leaves open a very important question is if the US walks away from this, how does it walk away? If it walks away and it continues to allow the military assistance that's in the pipeline from the Biden packages of assistance that were still in train, contracts that are still playing out and being delivered."
5nocYD2Qfvh,7223,Jack Goldsmith,"And also has been used in ways that even previous presidents have somewhat bent, you might say, the intention. This has gone further. Am I right about that? Yes, I think so. I mean, it is an important provision of the Constitution. It was a provision designed to establish the executive branch mercy. That has an important role in reconciliation. It's played an important role in the Civil War and the Vietnam War and other contexts. It's a check on certain forms of prosecutorial abuse. Done rightly, it is, I think, a very important power and one worth preserving. The problem is that it is stated in absolute terms, and the Supreme Court has interpreted those absolute terms to meet to be absolute. It really is an enormously broad unchecked power, and presidents for a long time have been using it in politically self-serving ways. Bill Clinton did this. The first George Bush did this. Donald Trump abused the pardon power for self- serving reasons like no other president ever, and then of course, we just had President Biden pardoning his son. So there's nothing in the pardon power that prevents these self-serving pardons, but it's really corrosive of the pardon power and not necessarily of the rule of law since this is the part of the law, but it's certainly corrosive to the idea of even-handed justice, that the president can use a pardon to give a get out of jail free card to his friends and family."
dpguiGE2gnv,15410,Anne Applebaum,"It's hard for you to make yourself say that, it's such an unbelievable Orwellian lie. It is. So, Ukraine started the war. But also making up numbers, acting as if Europe had no role in supporting Ukraine. Actually, if you total up the money, both economic and military, Europeans have given more to Ukraine than United States and paid a larger price in all kinds of other ways as well. All of that as a package did make people like Friedrich Merz say, ""Is the United States still our ally?"" And you've had some really extraordinary editorials. The Financial Times , which is not exactly like a beacon of anti-American radicalism, ran a big editorial questioning whether the United States was a European ally or a European adversary, others have been saying the same. And it suddenly makes a whole series of things look different. And not just defense, I mean, I'll talk about defense in a second, but economic relationships, business deals. There are a lot of things that Europeans do as a kind of homage to the United States. Buying certain kinds of American products or big investments, investing in American defense technology, by accepting the dominance of American tech companies. All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another."
Yu_4GaiQk4-,2704,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Anyway, but on the border, it seems to me that if he can get, if Trump can keep cooperation from Mexico, it just feels like two or three months from now he could be saying border crossings are low, and they could have footage of the border being sort of quieter than it looked a year ago, right? Just for political [inaudible]... Yeah, absolutely. And there was a Trump effect eight years ago, the first time he came into office, where migrants looked at his rhetoric and said, ""We're going to wait a little while to see what's actually going to happen."" So in spring 2017, I think April 2017 saw the lowest number of border patrol apprehensions in 50 years since this 1970s, the early 1970s. And that's not because Trump had done anything. It's because migrants were looking at all of his rhetoric and going, ""We'll see how much of this is bark and how much of this is actual bite."" And I fully expect something similar to happen in the first few months of his term where border crossings will drop, not because of any change in policy, but more because people are just waiting to see whether he's going to carry out these harsh policies that he said he would on the campaign trail. And just to finish with this, none of this really has big legislative implications, it sounds like this is all stuff Trump can just do."
r5MgCHHvMVA,8723,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't know, all kinds of things happened, right? A world of Afghanistan being the headlines is very different for a world of Ukraine being the headlines. So 2022 surprised on the upside for the Democrats, I think it's fair to say. They passed all that stuff, they outperformed in November. And then everyone decided, and I think you and I sort of had this view that, well, oh man, these Republicans are crazy. And the investigations are going to be nuts. And how could this McCarthy, 15 votes, 15 ballots for the speaker? How could they hold it together? Democrats had incredibly smooth transition. You've talked about that, how Pelosi pulled that off in a really amazing way, with no squabbling even. And the new team comes in, and they're competent, it seems. Schumer's been there as leader for a while on the Democratic side. And so far, I've got to say that in 2023, I don't think it's been a terrible year for the Democrats, or a great year for the Republicans. But certainly the imbalance, I think a lot of people expected. Where the Democrats were going to, as it were, win the congressional fight writ large. I wouldn't say that's exactly happened. I think the most, the craziest Republicans have popped off, but it's been a one or two day story."
Lk6smyW1fW3,7381,James Carville,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined again by James Carville. We last spoke in September. James was worried about the Biden campaign, gave some useful advice, I think. We can talk about where he thinks things stand now. I won't even bother with the introduction of James, he needs none. So James, thanks for joining me. Well, thank you, Bill. Always a pleasure. But I wish it were under the happiest circumstances, but here we are. Well, let's make them happier. Yeah. We can do it here. Tell... where are we in the campaign and the presidential campaign, we're discussing, what is it? May 29th, just after Memorial Day. That's a traditional break point, right? Where everyone says, ""Okay, where are we on Memorial Day?"" Where are we? And then, let's get to what should be done. Well, first of all, just if you look at the overall thing, people feel like the country's gone in the wrong direction. The combined number of people that would rather have another choice is high, as I can ever remember it. The third-party vote at this time is as high as I could ever remember it. But the actual distance between President Biden and Trump is anywhere between even and Biden minus 2. It's 2.5 maybe."
U089ZkpkHLd,5710,Larry Summers,"And indeed by all press accounts, the US trade representative was in the midst of testifying in Congress when he learned that there had been this dramatic reversal. So I think there is real financial risk that is present and maximizing uncertainty maximizes the risk. And the risk is probably front loaded because if people get used to the fact that there's a hugely uncertain environment, they will de-lever. And then in expectation that there will be more errors, markets will adjust themselves in ways that will allow more room for error, principally by going down to lower values which will be bad economically. But right now, I think we are in a moment of very substantial risk, Bill. So the markets haven't quite adjusted. It takes time, the process of de-leveraging, the process of finding a new level, takes a risk. And the important to understand about financial markets and financial market risk is that the law of supply and demand doesn't always work. What's supposed to happen is when prices go down, demand goes up and that sort of equilibrates the system. But in financial markets, when prices go down sometimes people get margin calls or forced to de-lever and then they have to sell. And sometimes everybody just gets more scared because prices have gone down and they want to become net sellers."
hKz3QR9Z-yZ,8013,Mark Esper,"We know North Korea is doing the same. So we're seeing a degree of cooperation between these countries that we've never seen before, and we should be concerned about that. I think people would be interested just people haven't served in the Pentagon as you have, certainly not at your levels. Secretary of Army, Secretary of Defense, I mean... I don't know. What was your day as Secretary of Defense if I could just divert to that for a few minutes and then we'll get to some of the substantive issues about both the past and the future? But I mean, people don't have a sense. I mean, it's such a massive enterprise, even I don't know. I've served in the executive branch obviously, but I don't even quite have a sense of what you do. How do you think about even being Sec Def? Well, for some biographical information to kind of set the stage, I went to West Point, spent 21 years in the Army, 10 on active duty, 11 in the Guard Reserve. And then, as you mentioned earlier, I did my time on the Hill and then served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the George W. Bush administration. So when you trace back the individual steps, I'd actually served in the Pentagon five times total."
EjK-80q2MUh,8822,Robert Kagan,"We can't really control what happens. Yeah. Well, and that was the view, don't tell the south what to do. They have to deal with their world, their way, et cetera, et cetera. That's what Buckley was arguing in the '50s and '60s. But we've had a federal government that has seen it as its job, if some cop shoots a Black person, to see whether that requires some kind of trial, and cops have been tried and convicted. That doesn't have to happen. That requires a real determination to make it happen. Throughout most of American history, cops like that were never punished. They were applauded in some cases. It doesn't take... Again, people are like, the jack boots don't need to be marching down the street for America to change very fundamentally from where it is right now. The fact that there are certain minority groups that don't seem to be conscious of the fact that it's definitely going to be turned on them. As I watch the protesters, and I don't even want to get into the justice or lack of justice of their protests, but the fact that people who are sympathetic to Muslims would think that Biden is worse than Donald Trump when we know what Donald Trump is going to do as far as American Muslims are concerned."
AbsQ_CMd6PS,6676,Jack Goldsmith,"They did a terrible job in the first term on that, but this is where the action is going to be, in my opinion. Does that make sense? Yeah, very much. I think I was about to get to Schedule F, the new schedule they're going to... Apparently, I guess they had the discretion to just put in place, which would turn a fair number of civil service jobs to political appointees. There already are a couple thousand others and maybe three 4,000 political appointees, but now, maybe many more. How much does all of that add up potentially or how likely is it to add up to a real change from what was maybe too bureaucratic too rule-bound, too whatever you want to say, administrative state-ish, Administrative Procedure Act- ish, kind of government executive branch to sort of the opposite problem, which is some version of, I don't know what you want to call it, Richard Daly Chicago in... Yeah, the spoil system. Yeah. And personal, either explicit corruption or not really corruption in the sense of money changing hands, but favors. And again, no expectation of equal treatment for people or bidding. When I was at the Education Department, I mean, bidding processes for grants, and it was yeah, and then you'd be appealed of something. One person on the review committee had some relationship with one of the places that got the $5 million education grant."
owD3pyWpEkp,6437,A.B. Stoddard,"Those are all reasonable concerns on the other side, I suppose. Of course, I'm with you, Bill, that I think that if Biden said, ""Look, we have this great,"" to use Bill's pair, ""this great pair of leaders, Governor Whitmer of a blue state of a swing, important battleground of Michigan and Reverend Warnock, senator from the important swing state of Georgia, they're the next generation. They have their own ideas. They need to make a new Democratic Party, but most importantly, they are in touch with the America of today, and Donald Trump is not, and it's time to turn a page, and that old man needs to go home just like me."" I just think it would be incredibly energizing to have, when the entire country is dreading the choice of Trump and Biden. They don't want either one. So I always thought that was the right thing to do. And of course they would have a little independence, like you said, to create distance while obviously championing the issues that unite the party. And abortion and mass shootings are top of mind for young voters and will very much drive the turnout of young voters in the next cycle. And so they could concentrate on the things that they agree on while saying crime is a serious issue and we need to control the border or whatever they would need to do."
2LFr7cT_Kl7,6677,Robert Kagan,"I don't think it's just a sidebar. Oh, these guys happen to be kind of isolationists as well, or these guys now for some bizarre reason don't like Zelensk3x1`y and sort of like Putin. I feel like that's a pretty important part of this anti-liberalism you're discussing. I believe that the America First wing of the party, the sort of Marjorie Taylor Greens and the Josh Hawleys, et cetera, are not interested in foreign policy at all. This is all about the war on liberalism, and their view of international relations is seen through the lens of the war on liberalism. And that is also true of the America First movement. And by the way, it's been true throughout American history. It has always been the case that Americans' views of foreign policy are primarily shaped by their views of domestic political battles. I mean, going back to Hamilton and Jefferson, I mean, their disagreement about foreign policy, which is like, do you support the British or do you support the French, the revolution, et cetera, was almost entirely determined by their fight that they were having about domestic politics. And in the South, in the 19th century, the realists in the South that the first sort of... People say things in the South which sound realist, is the Southern view that we don't want to be promoting liberalism overseas when people were getting exercised about Greek liberation from Turkey or the Hungarian Revolution, et cetera."
G84oiYlfqfu,3595,David Axelrod,"They had a brilliant convention in 2020 that was all or mostly virtual because of the pandemic, but they really branded Biden as a guy from Scranton who had good middle class values and sensibilities and economic values, who was a man of faith, who was a part of a military family. That was helpful. They used Republicans for Biden effectively. It was a lot of our people in the Republicans votes against Trump. Exactly, it was probably as well conceived a convention as I've seen and I've been a part of some that I was proud of. They did a great job and hopefully they can do that again and not have the thing overwhelmed by protesters. Is that an important moment you think, July, August, or are these days the conventions just come and go? I mean do you think that's sort of a possible inflection point? It used to be '88 Bush rallies at the convention, overtakes Dukakis. It doesn't seem like it happens quite that way anymore, but do you still think there's a- No, they're TV shows now and they're not watched as much as they used to be, but there's still an opportunity for branding and to tell a story. I talked at the beginning about the fact that campaigns are about narratives. You should leave a convention knowing what that narrative is."
3K9mTQmf2lG,6143,Robert Kagan,"But we can probably talk about that another... We should live as long, as they say. Yes, we can talk about that, the new secessionism and so forth in our next conversation. Right. Bob, thanks for joining me today. It's really been terrific. My pleasure. Thanks a lot. I enjoyed the conversation. Great, and thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
xUY3gs-vHx2,7858,James Carville,"You and I have seen a lot in Washington. I don't think we've ever seen that, nor anything remotely like that. I've certainly said, ""Well, we'll certainly be very considerate and understand a lot of the issues you have are concerns that we share. And my trusted aide here, please call Bill if you got any kind of issues that have come up."" Or anything like that. But no, I've never heard of that. No one would say, ""Well, yeah, James, that's $1 billion for regulatory..."" no, that's pretty unusual. Yeah. It wouldn't be a bad thing to make an issue of either in the campaign or in the debate, I suppose. No, I've also thought the safest pick. Trump will just go for the safest pick who won't cause any trouble for him. And Pence was that in a way in 2016, with a little plus on the evangelical side. And Burgum is a rich business guy. And I also think this is a... let's end on this... Your point about the males vote, which maybe it's worth developing a little more. I think Trump does not think it hurts him to have two males on the ticket. I think everyone thinks he's going to pick a woman or a minority, but I don't know that he... I think he has a sort of view which is pretty cynical, and we may not like it, but that two older white rich guys, that's kind of attractive to Republicans, and it's not that unattractive to a certain type of swing voter who thinks, well, those guys know what they're doing."
ZQrWpHCSSOu,16228,Anne Applebaum,"It's a drone war. Within 10 kilometers of the front line, nobody can move without being seen. So a tank or a truck or anything that crosses into that zone is immediately spotted and can be hit. And it's very difficult to move one direction or another. And some traditional weaponry that you thought would've made a difference, like as I said, tanks, armored cars, and so on, they're not useless, but they're not as important as they are. So the things that really matter Ukraine does have, and in many cases is now beginning to develop and produce itself. By the way, when the war is over, the world's greatest producer of drones and the most important possessor of the most cutting edge drone technology is going to be Ukraine. I mean, the resourcefulness and inventiveness of the Ukrainians under unbelievable pressure, obviously, and with difficulties, is really kind of, I do think that's a little, this is sort of appreciated now, I think maybe, now in a way that the USAID is dried up to some degree, a considerable degree. And also, as you say, some of the early things that everyone was focused on, the tanks and all, some of them got delivered, some didn't. In any case, they don't seem nearly as important. And it is kind of an amazing story."
TI4BTrNxSUt,7043,Jack Goldsmith,"Yes. So, I spend a lot of time trying not to be alarmed. So my general disposition is to not be alarmed and to wait until we have concrete evidence that we need to be alarmed. Because so many things in his first term that he pledged to do never came about. I suspect that's going to happen here as well. You already see, and I don't want to be naive, you already see some moderation in what they claim to want to be doing. So just with that background, for me, one of the most worrisome things is, and there's a contradiction in what the Trump people are saying, is whether they are going to fight the lawfare they perceived with lawfare of their own from the Justice Department. My own view is that the Trump people have credible reasons to be upset about some of the things that the Department and the Bureau did to them over many years. I wouldn't agree with all of their complaints, but you just need to read five or six Inspector General reports to see that the Bureau and the Department didn't always cover itself in glory. And there was another one that just came out yesterday from the Inspector General of the Justice Department, and we can talk, if you want, about which of the prosecutions and investigations were legitimate or not."
-4l-YXsp7jU,8662,Mark Esper,"Yeah. And I guess the Ukraine war suggests that it's not just, even if we don't get directly into a shooting war, if we're supplying an ally who's fighting an adversary, there too the strains can show up pretty quickly. It's been two years, which is a heck of a long time if you're in Ukraine and the suffering they've gone through and all that. But on the other hand, it could go on for longer and other things could pop up elsewhere as we saw in the Middle East. And I do feel like people just aren't... I don't know, how much do you think people in foreign policy, defense policy world have pivoted to this new world that we're in? The superpower competition, people use that phrase, but really the integrated or the way in which Russia and China help each other? Iran helps them both. Who knows how much real coordination there is, but at least there's opportunistic, I'd say coordination and taking advantage of things. I sort of feel like we're part way to coming to grips with this new moment, but still a little bit living in the 2000s or 2010s. Yeah, I think we could really use a greater sense of urgency in Washington about these matters, again, within the Pentagon and certainly on Capitol Hill."
To3wDfJiPO0,4729,Eric Edelman,"I mean, his losses have been extraordinary and the rate of advance has been really very slow. I mean, they've been advancing but at a snail's pace and mostly dismounted infantry assaults, very hard for them to make up their losses in equipment and much less in personnel. They have lost, according to British MOD intelligence numbers that were posted earlier this month, something like 967,000 people, of whom about 200,000 have died, been killed in action. They will probably hit the million-casualty mark sometime this month or early June. Those numbers are astronomical and they're not really sustainable. If Putin has to calculate that he is pursuing this with continued US support, continued European support, maybe stepped-up European support, that's one thing. But if he's able to- For Ukraine. For Ukraine, yeah. But if he's got to calculate that it's going to be US supports going away, European support is kind of iffy, then he's going to be stepping up his operations and think he can drive Ukraine ultimately to capitulate, which seems to be his objective. And that I think would be catastrophic not just for Ukraine, but for European security and for NATO and for US leadership in the world. And by the way, the Chinese will be watching. But yes, to your point, I mean this is not a coherent kind of worldview and it's not sustained by any kind of deliberative process."
-T59sqw6pYe,2429,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah. So temporary protected status is for people... It's a status that the Department of Homeland Security can grant to any country or even subset of a country where sending those people back would be a problem because of armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other serious issue that would make it dangerous to send them back. It came about because of the Salvadoran Civil War and the death squads there where the United States was deporting people back to El Salvador and many of those people would be found with a bullet in the head outside the airport 24 hours later in San Salvador. And so Congressman Joe Moakley really pushed hard for this in the 1990s because he thought it was fundamentally wrong for us to be sending people back to a place where they would literally be killed within hours or to a place where just because of the ongoing armed conflict, we were essentially sending people back to their death. And so right now there, yeah, about 1.2 million people have the status. It is extended every 18 months. Every 18 months DHS has to make a new decision whether to keep extending it or to terminate it. And so most of the designations now are set to expire in 2026, thanks to the Biden administration very recently extending four TPS designations and some are set to expire in 2025."
5tn-NWKjRZh,4867,Tim Snyder,"So I mean, just as a starting point, it's important for Americans to realize that we're not actually leading. We could be and we should be, we really should be, but we're not. But it's not... The Europeans lack what we have. They don't have all the stuff on the shelf that they can give away, and our manufacturing capacity should be much greater than theirs, although it's not because we haven't made the right choices. In Europe, it's like different countries at different points are doing the right thing. At the beginning it was the East Europeans who had been right all along and who then kind of threw what they had at the situation. You have kind of steady in the background the Norwegians, who have infinite resources. And then you have the Germans who, in an incredibly painful set of contortions, which are unbelievably frustrating if you follow them, and if you know anything about German history. Because if you know things about German history you know that actually Germany has a very profound historical debt towards Ukraine, which they're only very slowly realizing is the case. Germany is very, very slowly, too slowly, very slowly going in the right direction. And then you have the French who have been basically... Macron has seen, as generations of French leaders before him have seen, when there's a moment of American weakness, that's a moment when France can play a disproportionate role."
2QxWzoU3dMQ,7456,AB Stoddard,"On the other hand, he presumably does care about curing diseases and stuff, or at least isn't against it. The evisceration of CDC and NIH... that I really find slightly mysterious. He's not a rabble-rousing populist who thinks everyone with a degree as an idiot. He's proud of his own degrees, his own family, didn't he have some uncle at MIT... I mean, I sort of expected Trump... he might not like Fauci of course and all that, but to go in more of a conventional direction, you might say, of putting in people loyal to him, but trying not to just destroy these agencies, letting Musk do that. I guess it's centralizes power, personalizes power to get rid of all these people of independent standing, but it's a little bit risky. It seems to me. Anyway, so rule of law side of things and the kind of, I'm going to call it the NIH... to shorthand it, the NIH, but Social Security Administration. He was president for four years. He didn't think we have to get rid of a whole bunch of social security offices because it's somehow wasting money. It's an unbelievably tiny amount of money, and if it keeps his voters happy and they can go get their benefits fixed, and if something goes wrong by going to some office, well, that's a pretty small price to pay."
VrFDKFha1D_,2115,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"If you're the world's best electrician or plumber, you cannot, there's no legal visa for trades people, for example, which is actually a big concern for the United States as we have some issues hiring and recruiting for the trades. But that's a whole separate issue. So these people have been working, albeit though they're undocumented, they have been going to school, they have been whatever parts of their communities, and there've been attempts to give them paths to citizenship. That's, in a way, been at the core of some of the immigration legislation that was tried and failed in the 2000s and then in 2013. And so what does Trump propose to do about them? Deport them all. I mean, I think that is very clearly what they've said they want to do. And he's been asked repeatedly about the long-term undocumented population, he said they all have to go. That said, we have also seen members of his campaign and the incoming administration suggest, ""Oh, well, maybe those people don't need to worry as much because we're going to focus on the criminals first."" But the reality is, there are substantially fewer criminals among that population than there are otherwise law-abiding people who may be here in violation of immigration law, yes, but are not committing crimes or just going to work, doing their job, coming home, feeding their families, living a pretty normal life without breaking any other criminal laws."
75TSx1DRowT,8428,A.B. Stoddard,"But anyway, at this rate, it just seems that Trump is impenetrable, that his support has grown as his legal exposure has increased, and that the contenders around him, like DeSantis, cannot find a way to go after him. And unless they go after him, they can't beat him, and they can't take him out. So all of this pain and duress about not poking the base is really proving fruitless. They haven't come up with a response. They haven't found their secret weapon, their solution. They're laying their path, their way of distinguishing themselves from Trump, showing the base that he's truly vulnerable in a general election and that it's time to move on. No one will even call him a lame duck. I mean, imagine that's not hard to do. ""Hey, with Trump, you only get four years."" I mean, they won't say anything about this guy. And so he had a great town hall for him, I think, at CNN, and he's just steamrolling his way. Many things intervene, of course, Bill, but right now his firm grip on the party is as powerful if not more powerful than ever because, what's the goal? To get away with as much as he can. It's to get away with things. And he's gotten away with January 6th, and the plotting of a coup."
s777NKXNy3Z,7863,AB Stoddard,"I think painting that picture is a little hard because it's America. We're not used to that. And people don't focus that much on some of these more abstract, if you want to put it this way, issues. But I think the third term, is a way to get people to focus on it, right? Exactly. It's one of those things that people dismiss as unimportant, but actually could become the face of his authoritarian effort. It's critical because... I'm with Liz Cheney. He never intends to leave. He intends to die there. That's my belief. You'll have other guests on this show that disagree, and you don't have to agree with me. That's my a hundred percent opinion. I don't waver on that. There is a discussion as he tipped his hat to about JD Vance running and he would be his vice president. So then there's a 12th amendment issue with that. But they won't even bother doing that, I don't think. But Bill, I don't think- He'll run in the primary. He'll get the 10 million votes and then they'll tell the courts, what are you going to tell the voters? They can't pick me again because of some provision that was put in 230 years ago that's out of date? Completely. And that's why Democrats should say now, he doesn't even intend to do that scheme with JD Vance."
kUQpCPGp9vS,7585,A.B. Stoddard,"You talked to so many members of Congress and staff, but really members mostly, privately and sometimes off the record or in the background. I'm just curious, on both the Republican and Democratic side, how discomforted are most of the Republicans with the prospect of Trump? And is that going to have any effect? So revert to our earlier conversation about Trump for a minute. But then I'm very curious on the Democratic side, are they confident? Are they worried? Or they just feel like this is the hand we've been dealt and we have to play it out? And I don't know, what are they telling you? Democrats are very worried, and they wish that he had stepped aside, not stepped down from his job, but refused a second term. And they feel stuck with it, and there's nothing you can do. No one's saying anything on the record, and they believe that this is an enormous risk. Are they worried about the general election? They're in touch with their own districts. A lot of them are swing-ish. Yes. I think that the serious-minded Democrats know that the age issue alone could decide it. That's just a fact. We have close elections, and Trump, he has survived and come back and looks like he's going to be the nominee."
chK2eiki0YI,7993,Mark Esper,"And I believe as much as the weapons, training the Ukrainians to NATO standards, NATO tactics and techniques, when they would eventually go against a Russian army still using Soviet Bloc tactics really made a big difference in the initial days of the war. That's interesting. And you had a president who was famously skeptical of NATO. You had a foreign policy establishment that was also a little bit tired maybe of NATO that seemed like something from another era. But you, I think, always put a priority on it, didn't you with Sec Def and throughout your career, I think, and I think that turned out to be right. Yeah. Well, I learned early on that the allies and partners matter. They're the great asymmetric advantage that the United States has. We have dozens of allies and partners being both former legal treaty partners and allies and others who are just partners. And when you look at who the other team has, the other team being Russia and China, their lineup looks like this, North Korea, Syria, Mali, Venezuela. It's not a good- Iran, Iran, Iran. We have a far better team, and so we have to keep them together. We have to train with them, make sure that they're interoperable. And of course, I served for a few years in Europe as Army officer in NATO."
Pjq0aaHNL9k,6008,Aaron Friedberg,"Yes, there is an inclination to kind of fall back on the modes of thought and the ideas that you've had. And it's true. People who are newer to the scene and newer in dealing with these problems may have the advantage of being able to consider a wider array of possibilities than a more experienced leader might. There again, it depends partly on the extent to which that person has developed genuine convictions. I'm thinking about Truman in this regard. Someone who was not seen as a heavyweight, had some experience on foreign and defense policies from being in the Senate, but nothing like what he was thrust into when Roosevelt died, but turned out to have reflexes. He had the right kind of reflexes, which were sort of tough-minded. And he also was surrounded by a bunch of people who were experienced and did have a realistic and tough assessment of the world. And that combination moved him in the right direction. And in Harris's case, both are uncertain, but at least based on what she's been saying, for the most part, it's hopeful. Whereas based on everything Trump has said about foreign policy, to the extent that it's coherent, and if you actually read the transcripts of some of these interviews, they're not coherent at all. I think would lead to the conclusion that what he really believes is the America First, isolationist, protectionist, anti- immigration view that I suspect would emerge triumphant if he gets another crack at the White House."
APAwao0uNT2,5636,Tim Snyder,"Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I'm Bill Kristol. I'm very pleased to be joined today by Tim Snyder, Professor of History at Yale, distinguished scholar of Ukraine, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, author of the definitive work Bloodlands, and also author of more popular works on Russia and European History, and also on tyranny, freedom, and other big and important topics. Unlike many professors, Tim Snyder's scholarly books are accessible to the rest of us, and his popular books are based on scholarship. So that's a good combination. But just last week, what, your class on, what was it Hitler, Stalin and Us or something like that was disrupted at Yale, but you've survived that well. Anyway, Tim, thanks for joining me and let's discuss Ukraine. Okay, glad to be with you. Let's do it. Let's do it. So two years into the war, where do we stand in your judgment in terms of both the military situation and the broader geopolitical situation? And then we can go back and look a little bit at what happened before and then what might happen next. Okay. I mean, I guess the military situation, there's sort of the objective and the subjective side. I think subjectively, if you're an American, and this right, there are sort of two problems. The first is that the Biden administration, although it generally in my view, has done the right thing and has made a number of adjustments and has been capable of rethinking, in 2022 when things were really critical and sensitive and when the tide of work could have been turned, we spent too much time making decisions and our decisions were based too often on what we thought wouldn't make Putin nervous or they were based on virtue signaling like is this weapon system the right weapon system at the time?"
z_7k5UWzkAq,3251,Doug Sosnik,"Certainly of Biden voters in 2020 who probably voted Republican down ticket or voted Republican some in 2022 and very open to convincing themselves that even though they would've preferred it wouldn't be Trump, maybe Trump isn't quite as dangerous as people like me think and Biden's totally out of his... He has lost control and he's too old. That's where I think the age thing incidentally, I just want comment on really, it gives a kind of neutral excuse for those swingish Republicanish Biden 2020 voters to say, ""I voted for him once and I think it hasn't been great, but it's not terrible. But that was for four years, that was supposed to be a transitional thing, and now they want me to vote for him again and look how he's doing at some of these at the press conference the other night and so forth."" I feel like it's an easy way for those people to slide back towards the Trump voter, certainly to not voting for Biden. Well, I would say two things. One is we go back to ""Bill Kristol-adjacent Republicans"" for a minute. If you look at the 2022 midterm elections and the failure, despite all the advantages in the world of the Republicans to take back the US Senate, the day after the midterms in which for the second cycle in a row, Republicans did not take back the Senate when they should have."
zZnoKOUfQ0o,7480,Robert Kagan,"But that's literally what Bill Barr is saying. Not me. Right. I mean, the next Bill Barr will say, and again, what he's made very clear that he's not going to put the Mike, whatever you think of them, the Mike Pences and the Bill Barrs in charge again. This has been so interesting. Final point, though. You're a foreign policy historian and scholar and practitioner student. I am struck as we've been thinking about this, I'm thinking about this here. It can't be an accident that America First comes out of this moment in the '20s and '30s that you've been describing, and that the modern America First, the term that Trump actually revived, and I remember when he did it, I thought, ""You can't revive that term. It's so discredited,"" and I was totally wrong. It's now totally part of the discourse. It's the America First wing of the Republican Party, which is Trump's wing, and you can be anti-Ukraine and pro-Putin and so forth. I mean, talk a little bit about the connection, if I'm right about that there is really a connection, and I guess how central it feels to me it is. I don't think it's just a sidebar. Oh, these guys happen to be kind of isolationists as well, or these guys now for some bizarre reason don't like Zelensk3x1`y and sort of like Putin."
8izEacZ5eyb,10882,James Carville,"We had terrible disaster in Lebanon and the fall of '83 with the Marines being killed. But one got the sense... I mean, he acknowledged it and then he pivoted very quickly. And I'm not using that as an example. And Reagan, of course, everyone cites, is too much. He's too high a standard, I suppose, on a political scale, but it feels like they could be more decisive, whichever course he chooses to take. Or even if he chooses to change course. Yeah, I remember '83, the [inaudible] you know? I actually think he was too willing to move on. I think some people really screwed that up. I agree totally. Yeah. But he got beyond it. That's undeniable. But there was some... look, there's no more massive act of negligence on a part of any nation since World War II than there was about Israeli government on October 7th. That's just staggeringly... and so much of that was a result of hubris, of thinking we had everything under control, it was all done. And boy, when you look back at how arrogant they were, you could see how something like this would happen. And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have?"
mgGyMUHbg8M,8399,Mark Esper,"Look, at the end of the day, for senior officers that have to go up for Senate confirmation, even for any officer, frankly, they're all subject to confirmation by the Senate. The president can put anybody on that list he wants or pull anybody from that list he wants. Certainly, with the most senior folks, I would make sure that it was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or service chief that I would make my recommendation to the president. I would interview with him once I'd done my interviews, but it's the president's choice, and I always thought that to be the case. So a president can pick who he wants, and so that's another important function there when you get to that level. The White House staff, I'm just curious, having been on the White House side of this and in a much lesser role as Vice President Corral's Chief of Staff, but how intrusive can they be into this, or do they- You worked there, so you recall, look, there is a role for the White House. There is a degree of vetting where- That's an unusual statement by a Sec staff. That's really nice of you to say that. I'm going to bounce the equation here in a second. There is a role for the White House."
v-Fo3QASQu_,15363,Anne Applebaum,"Also, France has been talking about becoming independent of the United States for a long time. This is the moment that some people in France have been waiting for. So, I don't know. There's a slightly different story in each one of those three countries, but right now anyway given who's currently in charge, I think their feelings about this are pretty solid. But whether it will last, I cannot tell you. No, who can? I mean, the kind of shocks we've delivered, very hard to predict what the second and third order effects are, including a reaction in the other direction, as you've been saying, in a way more of a sense that they have to assume a burden. But on the other hand, practically speaking, the US has been so central, of course, to NATO and to the whole just defense enterprise, just as a practical matter in terms of capabilities and stuff that it's a little daunting. Well, you were about to say something about that. So let's look at that side. I mean, what's going to happen with Trump? We don't know if US policy is going to go even worse or go slightly backwards, a tiny bit towards a less radical version of Trump-Vance-ism or whatever. But I mean, say what you think would actually..."
KAvRJ7uqoP6,15744,Anne Applebaum,"And in the speech I said, the moral thing to do right now if you're afraid of autocracy returning is to support Ukraine, and pacifism is a false argument to be made in these circumstances. It's like being a pacifist in 1938. And I expected a big pushback that that would be a very unpopular thing to say in a big venue in Germany, and it turned out not to be. So it turned out that it was heard and accepted and that idea was okay with a lot of Germans who I didn't think... And that's just a little tiny example. I mean- No, that's important, that's important. Those ideas are now mainstream and they're acceptable and they're felt really strongly. I had a book published in Germany. I do a lot of public events in Germany. There are enthusiastic emotional crowds of people who are worried that if Ukraine were to fall or Ukraine were to collapse, that the next thing that would happen would be a push on Poland and Germany. You don't have to be on a border with Russia to be under Russian attack, remember that. Yeah, no, that's very interesting. They feel it really strongly. So I can say that for sure about Germany. I mean obviously, and the threat from the AFD, as I said, is primarily a threat of what's perceived to be correctly as a pro- Russian party."
5wU4oNj6jZ6,7963,A.B. Stoddard,"McCain fell short, Obama won the nomination, but in each case that's how they became the plausible alternative to the person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W. Bush. So what do you think of the Iowa, New Hampshire strategy, and does he have to start taking on Trump? I think with Trump's lead, he has to start taking on Trump, but I understand in the absence of that he is going to try to sell himself, I am the man of all these accomplishments, I don't have baggage, I get things done, Ron delivers. That's going to be his message once he's a candidate. And I think he is really smart in this moment of reset where there's been all this disappointment that he was going to rescue the party and turned out to look like he was maybe losing his nerve. I think it's very shrewd that they went ahead and they got the endorsement of Steve Cortes, which he's a huge Trump supporter, and it's a pretty big deal and it makes it look like Ron has a few more tricks up his sleeve. So that instills some hope in the people who want to keep supporting him. And then to come out and unveil a whole slew of Iowa endorsements and then a whole slew of New Hampshire endorsements, the ones from New Hampshire yesterday totaled 51, both lists had people that the Trump campaign had said were endorsing them that turned out to be false information."
7V5O9efbVLN,3319,Eric Edelman,"Now, in an ideal world, they would like to do this not only with a US blessing, but preferably with the US either participation or assistance for things like in-air refueling, certain kinds of munitions, which the US has that Israel does not... Sometimes that translates into, you'll see stories in the New York Times and elsewhere because American officials will suggest that, ""Oh, the Israelis can't really do it without us because we have all these enablers and this equipment."" My experience with the Israelis is they will do what they feel they have to do if they believe their survival is at stake, and they will do things we would never dream of doing militarily. If you think about the Israeli raid on the Osirak nuclear power plant in Baghdad in 1981, the Israeli mission was flown using aircraft in ways we would never have done. I mean, they put their pilots at risk. They were flying with a tolerance for fuel levels that we would never allow because those pilots came back from that mission essentially flying their planes on fumes. We would never have done that. But one constant mistake I've seen in my experience in government is American intelligence analysts and government officials assuming that people will or won't do things because we would never do it that way."
AS5Izfq-67F,6908,James Carville,"A lot of them have different reasons. We need some of those people. And if we can drive a stake between MAGA and them, we could get some or some could stay home because they're not comfortable with it. And I do think that MAGA is going to be here. Martha Ann Alito will be here far after Biden/Trump is gone. Let me tell you, she'll be here. So I think that's a potential to tie him to the movement. 'Cause the movement is, according to NBC poll, is a 24% approve. He's 42. I think you have an opportunity there, but you got to take opportunities at every point. And I think there's only so much Biden can do. I think if you've talked to them, they'd say, ""James, that's a great idea,"" but we've got to get him out there to say that and that that's not the easiest thing in the world to do. And I can understand that. But let's see if we have this debate on the.. June the 27th. Yeah. I am struck how much people just assume it's going to happen because Trump said he would do it. I assume Trump won't do it if he thinks it not in his interest. He said he was going to testify to trial. [Inaudible] he thought that."
VGz2hTLvVPB,7432,Robert Kagan,"It was a liberal war, and it therefore reinvigorated liberalism. And I suppose these groups don't have to have a fervor necessarily for anti-liberalism. I mean, in a way, one point you make is, anti-liberalism in a way is a default position or can become a default position. Yeah. If people aren't reminded of the importance of liberalism, of liberal principles, you could just slide into sort of normal transactional ethnic group politics in theory, which God knows we've had that in many, many centuries and many epochs in many nations. And it needn't lead to, as I say, to crazed hostility to this group, or that it can just lead to bargaining, but a kind of lack of any principle. But it does slide into hostility because, of course, when there's no principle to constrain you, the bargaining gets more and more. Right, right. It doesn't stay at a level of polite, just kind of slight preferences and economic policy for one region over another, but it slides into a more anti-liberal default, I suppose. I mean, just to really underline that point, liberalism I think is probably more antithetical to human nature than non-liberalism because it really does require a certain selflessness. I remember when, I don't know whether Frank was just quoting Hegel or what, but there's this argument that human beings crave recognition."
gaF7DJ7wrzY,8433,James Carville,"I feel like everything is a one-off and there's no theme or narrative. Is that a little unfair or is that just the way the world is today with social media and stuff? Or what do you think about that? You ran a campaign that was very good at staying on message and developing a very consistent message for weeks and months. I think it's very fair. I think it's very fair. And there are things that he's for that people don't know. And one of the big problems they have and that everyone has is we don't know how to run against Trump because he's a liar, but he's going to appoint bad people to the government, all right? There's so many things. Is he a crook? Is he a risk to national security? Is he going to end the federal bureaucracy as we know it? Is he going to put these really crazy judges on a bench? Is he going to get out of NATO? And people are just sort of overwhelmed, and we're not focused in on how we want to run against Trump. And the president's campaign, I think that economic message is, ""things are better than you think they are,"" which if left alone, maybe some pea shoots of hope, some consumer confidence numbers might look a little bit better, but you've got to let people come to that conclusion because if you come to that conclusion for them and they don't think it's a good economy, they say, ""Well, how can this guy fix something that he doesn't even think is broke?"" every conversation that everyone has in every focus group about President Biden begins with age, in the middle it's age, and at the end it's age, and that's a real fact that they have to live with, and they've just got to plow through it."
ACIx73wOFD9,15342,Anne Applebaum,"But the rapidity of the shift did take people by surprise. I mean even though it was predictable, everyone should have seen it coming, et cetera, et cetera, it's still, the last two weeks felt really fast. The US is done and they're saying so in a very clear way. And that I think is going to have ramifications that will last for a long time. I mean, in terms of whether the Europeans can help Ukraine, the answer is yes. Again, their help has been really key so far. The missing piece is that the Europeans are part of NATO and the leader of NATO is America and the supreme allied commander of NATO is an American. And so all of the decision- making processes all run through the United States. The assumption that the US would lead has been part of the NATO structure. And so rethinking that structure or rethinking how Europe could act together differently outside of that structure is not something you can do in five minutes, to be fair to Europeans. I mean there is something like a coalition of the willing emerging, and it certainly includes Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Poland, now Germany, UK, France, depending on their elections, Romania, and a handful of other large countries, maybe Italy, maybe Spain, they're a little farther away from the war and they don't feel it as sharply."
YLmcd_uEj_a,8129,James Carville,"When you're fortunate enough to have people that understand that and can explain it, it's a valuable thing because most people want to just give money to Amy McGrath or fund something that they like. A Detroit voter registration project, which I have nothing against. I'm all for Detroit voter registration projects, but that's what other people would do. It's not what we do. We're kind of a one-trick pony kind of people. Let me ask you one, maybe close with this. In our previous conversation... Actually, the two we had where you were worried about Biden, you commented that he seemed to be holding the older white voters okay, but there was massive erosion among younger voters and Black and Hispanic voters I think. Harris changed that equation much? Does she have a challenge with the older white voters? Does she still hold them? How does that work? Look, she has a potential to hold them or most of them, but what she does really have advantage. We had John Della Volpe on our podcast last week. He was a Harvard youth survey guy, which actually in spite of being from your alma mater, it's actually quite good. Right. No, they do a pretty good, they do a pretty big survey of young voters, right? Yeah. And he said that there's real changes, that there is."
PT_li198f6S,2561,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So, Aaron, thank you. Thank you for joining me. Thank you for having me. No, no, my pleasure. So, it was big in the campaign, and then Donald Trump has said, his lieutenants have said, big announcements coming right away and a lot of them on immigration policy. Let's go through the different areas maybe of the buckets of policy. There'll be the border, there'll presumably be a lot on the interior, the famous mass deportations, and that's legal immigration as well, visas and stuff, so let's... What about the border? Heard so much about the border, but it's kind of confusing actually. So what's actually happening and been happening at the border? And what do you expect the Trump administration to announce? Yeah, so the state of the border right now is unlike anything that we have seen a president take control of in their first days in the last decades, maybe ever. And that's because the border today looks very different than when it did when Donald Trump took office eight years ago. Right now, Mexico is carrying out its harshest and most significant crackdown on migration really in its history. Mexican immigration officials are setting arrest records nearly every month and blocking migrants from getting to the US-Mexico border at the scale that they had been for a lot of the last few years."
csnQNxnVIFm,15899,Anne Applebaum,"But I mean, it wouldn't be- The threat is that they don't keep their sovereignty, they won't be independent countries anymore. So Putin really is a funny way, if it were, helping is not the right ... You know what I mean? They see the threat of Putin as very real, if I can put it that way? Not just Putin. Not simply as an abstract matter of international relations theory or something. Not just Putin. I mean, there is now, I mean, people don't want to say it quite like this, but there is now also a threat from the United States. There's a threat that US tech companies dominate and control European political conversations, that they prevent the development of European competitors. I mean, there are other kinds of threats directly from the United States as well that people are also just beginning to grapple with. Yeah, that's so interesting. I mean, I do think here also, again, people didn't ... Trump and Vance had been sworn in and everyone was focusing on a million things, and Vance supports the AFD and it was just a little weird and Elon Musk and people weren't happy about it, I don't think, but there was not much ... People didn't understand how that would look actually in Germany or in Europe, right?"
eGr2B39lk-K,3030,Eric Edelman,"It is amazing, people don't... I myself, until I thought about it for a minute, didn't quite think of this side of it. We have huge, big relations with Qatar. We have a massive base there, there's a ton of... They've reimbursed us in times we've asked for more money to help them, to help improve the base, they've paid, I think generally tend to pay that. We, in return, have tried to help in a way not press them as hard as we might have on their hosting of Hamas. So this is a complicated state- to-state relationship and people can reasonably differ on exactly where, which equities are more important and who should be pushing harder on certain things. The conventional Republican position over the last few years has been that we've been too soft on Qatar actually. Biden didn't push hard enough on the fact that they were hosting Hamas and were friendly to Hamas right after October 7th and friendly to, they hosted the Hamas-Iran meeting right after October 7th, maybe, of the foreign ministers or something. They hosted the Taliban for years as well. Yeah. Okay, that's all, I would say, legitimate debate. What's really striking about Trump is there's no evidence that any of that is being factored in, right? It's about the plane, as you say."
HQn3tnSS8nr,10430,James Carville,"Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list. People that listen to this, make a list of all of this, ""First time this happened in the 2024 election."" First time somebody dropped out, first time they had a debate in June. So something tells me we're going to see a lot more first here. We're not done with first. We should have a running list of, ""First time..."" Blank. And it was the first... Very obvious, first time a woman's been ahead of a ticket or first time... I hate the term, woman of color, but that's okay. You're non... I don't have an objection to it. I just think it's such progressive arrogance to assume that everybody who is not white is the same. Right. That's why it drives me crazy. But anyway, whatever, first non-Caucasian to ever be at the top of the ticket, first to never get a single primary vote. That's one of my favorite arguments that I got. I get this a lot. I like to do kind of right-wing media, unlike most people because it keeps me... It's good when you... In old age, they tell you to do these, you should play bridge and you should do..."
qrfaGfcwpX4,8689,James Carville,"There's one word that Biden needs to use more often: the recovery. By saying, ""The recovery,"" is enough. You remind people that we were down. We can argue whether or not people were better off four years ago or whatever, but we can't argue that we're certainly better off when I took office on January 1, 2021. But use the word recovery because that connotes that you're recovering from something. So, if you see somebody that just had surgery and you say, ""How do you feel?"" They don't go... then you say, ""How do you feel?"" ""I'm recovering?"" You say, ""Well, good. I'm glad to hear that."" Not to say that, ""I'm fine,"" but, ""I'm recovering,"" because, oh yeah, if I had open heart surgery I would want to be recovering too, or anything like that. So I think that's one word that they need to use. And that people will say, ""Well, yeah, it was better than it was."" And I don't think it's a frontline attack but it's certainly a secondary attack if he answers, is the grotesque mismanagement of the pandemic. I mean, we just forget how bad that was. A I don't blame people. Who wants to remember? I hated the God damn thing. But I think every little word is going to count in this, and I think recovery is one of those words that can help him."
A7lVAH9igws,9225,James Carville,"She's running against a guy named Wesley Bell, who's actually a prosecutor, and describes himself as a Black liberal. Remember that used scare people now. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yes, of course. Come on in. They put a bunch of money in there, but they're running a really smart campaign, all right? They're not running it. He's got good consultants. They're talking about she voted against the Infrastructure bill. One of 10 people. I hope I'm right, but I think Bell's going to win and tomorrow, I will be commenting on it. That would be the second person in the squad to be defeated and I think in both cases, the campaigns... Even though a lot of people were interested in it, probably because of Middle East politics and other stuff, the actual messaging of the campaign was more about just not being a radical obstructionist really, and being a mainstream liberal. These people have literally been... Not only are they wrong about everything, they destroy everything. We're going to have to deal with Harris's 2019. That's a possible- Let's talk about that because I think the ad she had up today, I saw the new one is pretty much along the lines you're suggesting. She's a prosecutor, but they've cleverly, I think, linked together being tough on crime, not linked together but said she's prosecuted in a way that criminals and she's also got after big corporations that have been ripping people off."
PJYXpdUyl0k,8565,A.B. Stoddard,"Lafayette Square on June 1st of 2020. Just one thing after another. We could never catch a breath. We've caught our breath. People have forgotten. So it's a different dynamic, and I think that Democrats just assume that it's the same as 2020. It's not. No, that's very well said, and I think it's very shrewd actually, that people always want to fight the last election, but very different when you're the incumbent. God knows, I was in the George W. Bush White House and he wasn't a bad president at all. And people are tired, they want to change. Now, changing back to the guy from before is very unusual, and especially when it's Trump. So there's some Republicans probably would be better off to just nominate Nikki Haley and then have a normal ""election"", and win in a wrong track environment. Sort of a... But having said that, yeah, I agree. Trump's not as much of a disqualifier as a lot of us would hope. What about the Hill? We talked about Congress. You covered almost full-time. We cover White House too. But we thought it might be pretty crazy this year. So far it's been a little crazy. We'll see what happens with debt ceiling in the next couple of weeks, but maybe a little less crazy than we expected."

Hopefully, Gulag is part of history and it's not as much part of history maybe as we hoped and thought when the book came out, but here we are.

S3bN4hNEJJg,5734,Aaron Friedberg,"So Aaron, thank you for joining me. Thank you very much, Bill. So, maybe let's begin with, I want to get, obviously, to the choice we face, the different foreign policy options facing the American public, and their implications. But maybe just begin with, just the world, and do a quick lightning round, as it were, of a general sense of things. It doesn't seem like things have calmed down a lot since we spoke in January of 2024. No, it's to the contrary. I think they've heated up pretty much in all directions. Yeah, it is striking, isn't it? You could think these things go cyclically, but this case, say well, let's just go quickly around, the Middle East, the most obvious, but we should begin, say a word about that. Yeah, well obviously, there Israel is fighting on multiple fronts, continuing to fight in Gaza without any clear end point to that conflict. They don't seem to have achieved fully their military objectives and they've resisted pressure to agree to any kind of ceasefire, so they're continuing their operations there. And then the war with Hezbollah, which has been ongoing, in a way, I guess it's been ongoing for a couple of decades. Low-grade conflict has flared up with a series of remarkable Israeli strikes against Hezbollah at all levels, culminating, at least for the moment, with the airstrikes that killed the leader, Nasrallah, just a couple of days ago, and everybody's waiting for the other foot to fall, whether that's Hezbollah retaliation, or Iranian retaliation, or an Israeli incursion into Southern Lebanon on the ground, which is something which seems like a real possibility."
qDekUNIbBnY,7960,AB Stoddard,"This I am slightly mystified by in the sense that why isn't in his political interest to spend more money on fighting cancer? I mean, that's sort of a classic. If you look at the other demagogues and authoritarians, they actually often do spend a fair... they try to be the person who's vaguely in favor of kind of solving these kinds of problems. They're not ideological problems and they can throw money at it. What do they care? So anyway, but it is striking that he' so... Elon in this respect may be doing damage politically to Trump and as well as to the country, who knows. But what about the Democrats? They're the opposition party. They should be blowing, calling, sounding these alarms and rallying the opposition. They're in the minority and you've studied Congress and covered Congress a lot, and you know how weak or weak that makes you, even if you're a very large minority, which they are relatively speaking in Congress, but I don't know. What's your judgment of the Democrats? Well, again, I mentioned before that I am just horrified at how much they wasted the transition, a leaderless party. That's so interesting. I hadn't really focused on the transition as a key moment. People have now focused- It's almost three months. Yeah... yeah, that they could have really gotten a lot of stuff lined up, right?"
GbVSPFOBXdW,17640,Anne Applebaum,"People were doing different kinds of jobs three years ago, and yet they have put up this extraordinary defense. I mean, I think whatever happens next, the example Ukraine has set other societies for how you resist autocracy and how you stand up to violence and brutality. I mean, it's a great example for all of us. It's a beacon of hope. Well, thank you, Anne. That was really lovely, and I hope we don't succeed in betraying them, and I rather think we might not be... Trump may not be quite able to pull this off as much as he might like to. So thank you for those words about Ukraine. Thank you for the analysis, obviously of Europe and the US autocracy, democracy. Thanks really for everything you've been writing over the long time since we've known each other, and you've been writing on this for a long time back in the eighties and nineties, that Gulag , such a wonderful book, really authoritative book. When was that published? It was 2003. I was working on it in the nineties. Okay, great. Well, anyway, hopefully, that's... Well, I won't even go into whether that should be... Hopefully, Gulag is part of history and it's not as much part of history maybe as we hoped and thought when the book came out, but here we are."
xK1cLeuAaCu,7711,AB Stoddard,"And he did release an executive order recently, and it doesn't really matter what the terms were, but we can get into that, basically dictating to states how they should make these changes to their electoral systems. The federal government doesn't run elections, states do and localities do. So there actually, there has been a Democratic response. They're suing. And Hakeem Jeffries, the house Democratic leader and Schumer are on the lawsuit saying it's a power grab. And that's really important. Republicans are going to say, ""Oh, see the Democrats, they're opposing Trump because he wants stricter ID requirements. So non-citizen ""illegals"" can't vote. No, what they're stopping-and they need to make this clear to the voters- no matter what's in that EO, he doesn't have the power to dictate the way elections are run to the states. He's setting up a pretense for the states that don't follow him to say their elections were rigged. And this talk of the third term and whether or not your vote is going to count, I think alongside kitchen table issues is absolutely essential. To try to educate the public on what's coming. That Trump in the end intends to control the rule of law, the courts, everything. But he wants to control elections. He wants to find a way to a third term."
6S_oO0hA5Q5,6735,AB Stoddard,"So we're so far beyond a little bit of tweaking at the edges and some past administrations where of course your AG is a little nicer maybe to you or people in your party than the other party, but actually a pretty big effort since Watergate, I would say, to almost not do that and to bend over backwards. I think almost literally every administration since Watergate has had a special counsel appointed by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, if the attorney general recused himself. Even Trump's first term, right? I'm thinking of this... What strikes me is how radical it is... in the first term, Trump still felt constrained enough that he had to have a special counsel to look into the firing of Comey, and then Sessions felt old fashioned enough to recuse himself and Rosenstein appoints Mueller and Trump doesn't really quite have the nerve to fire him, and there's an actual special counsel report, leave aside Bill Barr and stuff for minute. But still. to even say those words, ""special counsel report,"" there's the Signal text scandal that broke last week. I mean, I'm so struck in the coverage of that that no one even said, ""well, gee, I mean maybe the Justice Department needs to look into that. The FBI, they need to have a special task force."
k_B2R9_PzBY,3738,Eric Edelman,"And that I think would be catastrophic not just for Ukraine, but for European security and for NATO and for US leadership in the world. And by the way, the Chinese will be watching. But yes, to your point, I mean this is not a coherent kind of worldview and it's not sustained by any kind of deliberative process. I know people hate foreign policy process, who cares, only foreign policy nerds like us. But John Bolton has a piece in the Wall Street Journal either yesterday or today in which he talked about the statements that are coming out of the Trump administration that now that Mike Waltz has been fired, that they're going to disassemble the National Security Council as we have known it. And John makes an impassioned defense for the system that largely emerged when you were working in the White House under Brent Scowcroft and Bush, 41. That has persisted to this day of committees of principals and deputies working through issues, resolving those that could be resolved at a low level and elevating those that really require the attention of the principals and of the President of the United States because our system is very presidential centric. And we're going to do away with all that which allows, however imperfectly because it hasn't been perfect and there have been all sorts of problems with the system and the outcomes have not always been great, but at least it allows for a deliberate consideration of pros and cons of policy and what the potential advantages or disadvantages that we have vis-a-vis our adversaries and how we might coordinate and consult with our allies."
lu3FxeaJT_M,6862,AB Stoddard,"And that was basically it. And they just said it over and over again and they had a good candidate, not a famous candidate, but a good candidate, and they won by 10 points. I mean, I do think maybe there's a bit of a lesson there for the other Dems, and maybe things will play into their hands a little bit because they will have to be votes in Congress on reconciliation and on taxes and on things. It's hard when you don't control Congress. You can't have the hearing today on the NIH cuts. But you could do quasi hearings, right? I mean, they're a little too paralyzed by, ""Well, we're in the minority, we can't do this."" You still get a hearing room. You could have the heads of three medical schools testify and fine. Is it elitist that medical school has, well, maybe some voters, but a lot of other people kind of think, gee, I don't know. Shouldn't we be advancing on the research against diseases? And same with foreign policy where I think Ukraine is an issue that splits the Republicans, right? Half of them voted for the Ukraine aid last year. Trump's selling out Zelensky to Putin. I don't know. There's a constituency for that. So they've slightly paralyzed themselves more than they had to maybe."
rm2zCXgK3OY,3104,Doug Sosnik,"The last thing I'll say, though, is Biden should be running like he's behind, and the reason that he should run that way is because he is behind. And that doesn't mean you have to do the 60 Minute[s] interview, but you better figure out, if you're not going to do it, what you are going to do to break through to people. Yeah. That's well said. I mean, the polarization, I guess, just trumps so much. That's one message you've-implicit or sometimes explicit-point you've been making. I mean, that is the tectonic shape of American politics today, more polarization, than, God, than we've seen, certainly. I mean, the idea that you'd move up 15 points after a good convention, like Bush in '88, or things would hinge on a debate in the last week, and, what, Carter-Reagan probably moved 10 points or something conceivably in that last week, it just seems inconceivable today. Things move two points and everyone's going crazy, right? Well, you have a world now-you're right-of what I call, ""high floors, low ceilings,"" which is because these tectonic plates are so baked in, it's hard to go below a certain number of support, and it's hard to get above a certain number. Now, that's where the problem right now is, is that Trump, as I said earlier, is kind of bumping up to the high end of his ceiling, and Biden is at least bumping up to the bottom of his floor."

I think in the back of my mind, this convention should be about a plan is ""we get you."" And the more that it's like that... Also, I would say one thing, don't let it become a celebration of coastal culture. That's a real problem because everybody's going to want to be there. Everybody's going to be wanting to shoehorn in. Pick your speakers, pick your entertainment. I saw I was very pleased this morning, Wisconsin, apparently I'm going to keep up with music that much being we're older, but they got a Wisconsin rock band or indie band or something that's playing. That's cool. Of course, you got Ben Wikler there. He's not going to let anything stupid happen, but just don't get overrun with Beyonce or Taylor Swift or anything like that. Not that Beyonce, Taylor Swift, anything wrong with them, but if you get people saying, ""These people are all too cool for me, I can't fit in that,"" then you're going to lose. Just remember all of that. And Tim Walz is just an antidote against all of that kind of stuff. But we'll see. You should have a good convention. You'd have to really, really screw this up to have a bad one."
KlKjdMPJuEZ,8930,James Carville,"Under 30 was 17% of the share, in other words, 17 out of 100 people who voted in 2020 were under 30. And of that, President Biden got 62%. Black was 12% share: about every 100 people that voted that were black, Biden got 90%. I don't think you're going to hit those numbers this year, so you have to make it up somewhere else. Now, the good news is we do seem to be doing somewhat better with older whites, which is good because they vote higher than other people. So, if you had to have somebody that you're doing better on, that's not a bad demographic to have. But, and I've said this before, and I'll say it again: I think maybe some people are uncomfortable talking about it, but the Democrats have a male problem. Males are 48% of the vote. I defy anyone to listen to say NPR and not hear, four times that, ""This is coming down to college educated women"" or ""No, I think it's coming down to women of color."" Well, women in general, yes-women are 52%, but how do you develop a political party that talks to 52% of the country? That's a big part, and albeit 52%, but we want to think about the 48% sometimes. Yeah. And I was struck, I was recently, I've been quoting your former boss and your friend Bill Clinton, what is it, Americans prefer strong and wrongs- Strong and wrong than weak and right."
5qhuugsC0Ps,10275,Mark Esper,"What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think. Right? I mean, I feel it's pretty big I think. Don't you think February 24, 2022 will be like a real, genuine moment in world history? Yeah. Look, I think it crystallized again this notion of a new era of great power competition with Russia and China being the adversaries. And keep in mind, it was just a few weeks before the invasion that Putin and Xi Jinping, the president of China, stood side by side of all places in Beijing at the Olympics, and they issued their 5,000 word statement about their strategic partnership and alliance, and would just be a few weeks later when Russia would invade Ukraine with armored columns and mechanized troops. And it was almost like the Nazi invasion of Poland in 39. I mean, it was just kind of a blitz into Kiev. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability."
LePoqxe2bSN,7458,Robert Kagan,"Yeah. Anti-liberalism is a strong force in history and a strong force in human psychology, I guess is what you're saying. And the founders saw that, right? They set up all these institutions and they were very worried about their survival because they saw how strong, you stress this point, how strong anti-liberalism was and would remain. It wouldn't go away after one or two generations of checks and balances working or whatever. I mean, whether Ben Franklin actually said ""A republic, if you can keep it,"" I mean, that certainly was the sentiment, which meant that he knew perfectly well and they knew perfectly well that for one thing, this is a voluntary system. At the end of the day, it's a voluntary system. It's a voluntary system for individuals. It's a voluntary system for the states. Even though states are not supposed to leave the federal government, let's face it, this government was formed by states agreeing to come together. Then they can decide that they don't want to be part of it, and that's another thing we didn't get into, but what happens if Trump loses in the election? But we can probably talk about that another... We should live as long, as they say. Yes, we can talk about that, the new secessionism and so forth in our next conversation."
YfWXD_PqLMz,8309,A.B. Stoddard,"We have to be even more of a culture warrior than Trump."" They spend half their time, that super PAC of DeSantis's, they're accusing Trump of being like in cahoots with CNN, and I just think that's the most ineffective... The idea that you're going to beat Trump by saying he's part of the establishment is just childish at this point. Trump, everyone thinks correctly, if he goes in for a second term, God knows what he'll do. So, DeSantis is unwilling to embrace the fact that he's got to be the candidate of the slightly more respectable Republicans than Trump and mobilize those forces, but in a way his campaign, until these very last few days, hasn't really gone in that direction. I just think your point about him attacking Trump and distinguishing himself from Trump is so important. And you said this 10 months ago, if he had to get up on stage and say, ""I love Donald Trump, he's a great president, great guy, unjustly persecuted by the libs, but, hey, vote for me for president."" I know the guy's been president four years, he won the nomination twice. He's the only Republican to win a general election since 2004. It's a little hard to say he can't do it again or he shouldn't do it again unless you say he can't do it again or he shouldn't do it again."
gh2ujya09Wv,5504,Tim Snyder,"There wasn't... the fascist regimes that are out there, or semi-fascist or whatever. Nasty right wing regimes weren't threats in the way the Soviet Union was to anyone else in particular, mostly, I would say in the '70s, '80s, Pinochet, whatever. And some of them democratized, and we did a little bit to help with that. We thought of China as, maybe incorrectly, still as communist, not as fascist. And then Putin, we were slow obviously in adjusting to. So there was about 20 years there where Milošević, I think there was a liberal conservative internationalist alliance to stop that in Europe. That was kind of... and again, but it's funny, I don't recall, and I was pretty involved in that in '95, '96, or even earlier, objecting within the Bush administration in '92 to our doing nothing. But I don't recall that we really thought of it as fascism, though I think that would not be a bad term, would it? For that. That was a real early indicator that fascism was a possibility, and an aggressive possibility, in a post-Cold War world. I think that's an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, ""These guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,"" which of course fascists are. Fascists have the cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness."
XQ3HPTmVUpc,2613,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"A lot of things can go wrong in an enforcement operation. Usually they're pretty nonviolent. Most people do not run from enforcement. Usually there are not a lot of concerns. But if you start ramping up detention, if you reopen family detention, you start sending parents and children to detention centers together and God forbid, a kid dies in a detention center as is a real possibility, it happened in his first term in office, we could see major shifts in the public's view of these. But if they managed to have some self-discipline, they might be able to win the propaganda war about how they're carrying this out, even if the numbers are not dramatically different. But we are also looking at: Are they going to invoke the Alien Enemies Act? Are they going to deputize the National Guard? How far are they willing to go, on paper or in practice? And we're going to be looking very carefully at those. That said, on week one, expect a lot of executive orders to say, ""DHS, start taking steps to move towards this change."" And so I don't think other than the changes to legal immigration, cutting off visas to certain countries, which can be done with a stroke of a pen, when it comes to enforcement, I think in the very short term there will not be very many changes other than publicity-related changes."
Yrc8tmVXlM8,16495,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, first of all, who invaded who? But there's this constant refusal to recognize this achievement, the holding the line. It is a smaller country, it is fighting a bigger country. And it had a lot of disadvantages. I mean, it still was a partially Soviet army. It has fewer people, all those things. And yet it's true, the collapse that people kept predicting never happened. Yeah. Say a word about, I mean, let's get to maybe to Europe more broadly. And obviously Europe has many different countries, as you know very, very well. Better than I, and different governments, and so we can break it up a bit if we want, but I just was struck... Again, I think people hear, it all happened so fast. That Friday Summit in Alaska, Monday meeting with Zelensky, Europeans get together with Zelensky over the weekend, and suddenly the most important European leaders are showing up here. I mean, it's pretty amazing, actually. I don't recall even quite seeing anything like that in my years of being in and watching and being around government. And I just wondered, A, were you surprised by the degree of coordination among the Europeans and also willingness to lean forward? I mean to really do something, taking on some considerable risks to themselves politically in that way."
jo4PiTUjOBN,5858,Aaron Friedberg,"And direct involvement of the U.S., that was- Right. And I guess, although we can't be sure what's going to happen next, what's striking, and maybe one of the reasons that these events don't get as much attention as they might otherwise is, the expectation in the past might've been any action is going to lead to some enormous and catastrophic reaction. And what's been striking is how little and how ineffective the reactions have been to both what Israel has done and what the United States has done. And in particular, from the Iranians. Their big contribution was to fire all these missiles at Israel back in the spring, and that was a dud. Those were all shot down, minimal effect. So it's not clear what capacity, I'm thinking here, particularly the Iranians, what capacity they actually have to hit back, and how willing they are to go up the next step on the ladder. Thus far, as I said, when they've tried it hasn't worked out well for them. And they seem to be hanging back. And that may be part of the Israeli calculation. They may have come to the conclusion that really, for various reasons, the Iranians either can't or won't take direct, escalatory steps. And what the Israelis are doing to Iran's surrogates is, among other things, humiliating to the Iranians and diminishes their perceived power in the region."
J2kSDpuq0v8,3337,David Axelrod,"I talked at the beginning about the fact that campaigns are about narratives. You should leave a convention knowing what that narrative is. That's the last chance really. I think this is an opportunity to do that. The candidates get to make speeches and those speeches, while the audience may be smaller, still are significant. I mean conventions are important. We had some great old conventions in Chicago. We've had 25 at which real decisions were made and sometimes historic decisions. It's not going to be that, but- FDR in '32, Lincoln and FDR. Taft and Roosevelt. When I was arguing for Biden should step aside and let's have a fun competitive race. I really liked the idea of the Chicago convention replicating Lincoln and Lincoln in 1860 or FDR in '32. It's not going to happen. Could also replicate 1968 of course, that was a bit of a problem. Yes. What about debate? Should Biden debate? We had this discussion. You may have heard if you listen to that. We had this discussion and Plouffe was of the mind that he has to, that he needs it. I think that it's probably wise to make that decision closer to the event because who knows what condition Trump is going to be in going into that convention? If you need it, you should do it."
kH4XAKWZhSY,7854,A.B. Stoddard,"Almost never to talk about that. And to talk entirely about Disney and so forth, but we'll talk about DeSantis, I guess, and sort of what you've learned about him as a presidential candidate so far. Well, we all know, and this so well, Bill, that the idea of running for president when everyone tells you that you have to do it, that you're the hope of the party is very tantalizing. Again, he comes off this amazing 19-point victory, reelection victory in which he won independents and Democrats just a resounding stunning win. And people are telling him he's the next hope of the Republican Party, and he has to come in and save the Republicans from Trump. And the idea with his wife's great encouragement, we reportedly know, of doing this is so different than doing it. And he's not even officially a candidate yet. But the guy looks so panicked. Now, obviously, as I said from the start, has not found a way to criticize Trump and separate himself from Trump. But even when he is standing at these podiums, they always have him in with big posters in front of the podium and people around him flanking him, and he has a new thing he's mad at that day... The Chinese buying property, the Disney corporation, the teacher, the groomer teachers, whatever it is that he's going after."
cNyB6oSlc_6,3303,Eric Edelman,"Is that possible in the next few months? How does that fit into the whole US/Israel relationship and so forth? That's number one. And then number two, we do just have this phone call, I guess yesterday we're speaking here on what Tuesday the 20th of May, between Putin-a two-hour phone call- Putin and Trump. So you've been involved in those kinds of phone calls in the White House and in the State Department, the Defense Department, what do you make of what we know about that? But so two big questions to Israel, Iran and Putin/Trump. So I said earlier that there are some nervous Republicans in the Senate and the House about what kind of deal might emerge from these discussions between Araghchi and Witkoff. I think the Israelis are nervous as well because they are very reluctant to see anything that allows Iran to continue to be able to enrich uranium. And that was of course their big complaint about the Obama agreement in 2015, which is that it left Iran with this industrial scale enrichment capability. And not only that, it allowed them to experiment with more advanced centrifuges that could enrich uranium at a faster rate and at a larger scale that would enable it to, on very short notice, amass enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon."
owxpM-Mar_r,7910,Robert Kagan,"And I think the answer to that is fundamentally political/demographic and the sorting of the two parties, which really does begin in this pre-war period when a very large percentage of the immigrants who come into the United States from Europe, from those parts of Europe that people don't want them coming from, are settling in Eastern cities for the most part, and are becoming part of what are then Democratic Party machines. And the Democratic Party is relatively open to them in a way that the Republican Party is not. And there develops then something which is still present today, which is a kind of suspicion of the city, a belief that the city is teeming with non-Americans. Now in that period, of course the Democrat Party still has the South, but increasingly under FDR during the Depression, and then especially during World War II, the Democratic Party becomes increasingly a party of minority groups, of ethnic minorities, of Irish and Italians. But also the Republican Party goes through... Basically is in the process of its Southern Strategy and trying basically to get white votes and therefore jettisoning Black votes. So Blacks are moving into Democratic Party in the thirties, and so when you emerge from World War II, you have what is going to become a national resorting."
fmk5Zi9Kuyw,8797,James Carville,"Give me anything more profound than that with deeper meaning, with... treat others as you want to be treated yourself. That the general concept of the golden rule, it's a breathtakingly good soundbite. It's very short, takes no time, and everybody understands the implications of it all. Now the problem Biden has is he's not very, and he never has been, very good on the attack. It is not just that he's old, he is just never been a particularly effective attack politician and how much of this he can pull off, I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting. What about this, we're talking Wednesday morning, the 29th. The trial is about to go to the jury in New York. Do you think that has any potential for affecting anything? Could the campaign use it effectively over a month if he's convicted? All this coverage in all these panels and he did this. This was a good day for that. I saw the expression on his face and I saw this and we got a panel here and there've been so many lawyer panels that I don't even know what to even think anymore. But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats."
k61qx8Brros,3455,Doug Sosnik,"I mean my slight-maybe caveat, I don't know what you think of this-of that count, which is very, very interesting. I mean particularly I want to say how important it is what you say about the sort of Clintons and then Obama/Biden dominating for so long, that they did probably suppress a whole generation of people who we know even who've left office by now, they rose and fell. On the other hand, of course as you say anti-Trump was key for the last six to eight years. On the other hand, the Democrats have produced... I mean, just came down from Mars and looked at, okay, they got Shapiro in Pennsylvania, they got Whitmer in Michigan, they got Polis in Colorado, and Newsom in California. They've got very impressive younger members of the house. Some of them not quite in the Senate yet, but they will get there. Abigail Spanberger will probably be governor of Virginia in 2025. They have actually what looks more like a normal bench, somewhat diverse actually and somewhat... Then there are people on the left, I probably mentioned a little more of the moderates. I don't know. But that Biden running for reelection again, I won't obsess on this, is sort of putting a cork over that. I do feel like, yeah, there's a real kind of..."
5WVbYQF2K3Z,14200,Anne Applebaum,"They've managed to pull themselves out. That sort of thing that's impressive about that meeting, pull themselves out of their own national and parochial, and issues with this and that, and suddenly they seem to be, more than I would have expected, honestly, presenting a kind of united front. I mean, you've got to think it some point, if we remain rogue or semi-rogue, let's just say, even if only semi on the side of the authoritarians, at least on the side of Putin, if not maybe China as well for that matter, there's so much pressure on them. I would think internally, I'm surprised ... Let me put this way, I'm surprised more politicians have risen up internally to say, ""Look, we can't do this. I mean, we cannot be fighting Russia, in effect, opposing Russia and China and the US is not really with us. I mean, we're not that big and we are fractured and they're powerful and they're ruthless, and why can't we just go back to a certain amount of business-as-usual energy policy?"" It wouldn't be crazy to have, I mean, it wouldn't be an honorable way to go, would ultimately be self- defeating. But I mean, it wouldn't be- The threat is that they don't keep their sovereignty, they won't be independent countries anymore."
uGvg2rlDiWl,3455,Doug Sosnik,"And then the sixth state that I would add is Nevada, which actually right now Trump is leading by more than the other states. And these are two states that narrowly voted for Clinton and for Biden. So we're back to the same handful of states which represent less than 15% of the US population. So the race starts out, nine months out with, remember, they reallocated the electoral college now based on reapportion and redistricting, which is a net six positive for Trump and Republicans due to population changes. So Trump starts out with 235 electoral votes. Biden has 226 electoral votes. So if 77 electoral votes at stake that are going to determine who the next President of the United States is. And so back to your question, traditionally there are the same swing voters generally in our country in the last 50 years. The swing voters that Reagan carried in 1980 are the same core group of swing voters that Biden needs to carry in 2024, which are, a couple of them are the independent voters, which we all know about, are moderate voters and suburban voters. But there are a couple of additional groups of voters that I think are going to be important to watch in this election because they're both so unpopular. One is third party candidates."
M4WnzINwp_H,4913,Aaron Friedberg,"So this is a serious problem that has been percolating for some time. It is getting worse in part because of the weaknesses in China's own system. It's inability or unwillingness to do things that would allow domestic consumption to increase. They are more reliant than in the past, or in the immediate past, on exports. So they have to push all this stuff out, and it's coming. And we're not going to talk them out of it, and wagging a finger at them or telling them, as we have repeatedly, that there's an alternative path, you should liberalize and so on is not going to work. So in my view, we need to defend ourselves against it, but we can't do it unilaterally. And what I propose in the article is a trade defense coalition, which would be a grouping of countries starting with our closest friends and allies, but also including some other industrial powers that see their prospects and their domestic industries being threatened by Chinese exports and imposing some kind of protective barrier between themselves and China. There are all kinds of issues with that. It's not something that's going to be easy to do, but I think of that as an alternative to what I see either a Trump administration or a Harris-Biden 2.0 administration from being inclined to do, although maybe it's closer to the latter."
qUf7IAE08xJ,3310,Doug Sosnik,"You've got a large number of non-whites who are lower educated voters who are moving increasingly towards Trump and the Republicans making it more problematic for Democrats. Yeah, I mean it's a close... Looks like it's going to be a close front thing. Either way. Let's get back, I want to get back to third parties in a minute. I've just got to think when there's two thirds of the voters don't want either of these people, there's a little more of a possibility of that than conventional wisdom in DC has it. But let me hold up on that for a minute. Just give people, I think a sense-not just-but of the events. I mean, normally, maybe this isn't their normal campaign and these things don't matter, especially. We would say, ""Well, what would happen? What's going to happen that it's going to matter?"" Trump will pick a VP, there'll be conventions, there'll be debate. They're usually these moments where there's a huge amount of campaigning that makes no difference at all or makes a minute difference in whatever locality they're going to or whatever issue pops up. And sometimes it can be an important difference if it pops up and it becomes a kind of big story like the special counsel or whatever. But the predictable things, I mean, are we just in a new world where all that kind of stuff matters so much less or does any of those things VP, conventions, debates, what would you pick of those?"
lDUvFlTDNbo,3647,David Axelrod,"He did okay in the debate. But I'm curious about what you think about the convention. It seems to me those are the two known-what am I supposed to say-the two known unknowns we know are going to happen. Well, will there be debate? Should there be? No, there are no knowns, actually. Isn't that Democratic Convention in Chicago a little problematic here? It is. Yeah, I'm worried about it. I'm worried about it. I think that we had a tumultuous convention here in '68 and a very calm and peaceful one in '96, and you worry that it would be more like the first than the second, particularly if the war is still raging. We haven't talked at all about immigration. That's the other thing that Biden has to move on. He can't just rely on Trump- Yeah, talk about that some more. Well, I mean, look, I think the border issue, whatever you think of Abbott's tactics, the border issue is now a national issue. In Chicago, it's an issue that's torn the city apart. It's separated communities that might otherwise be aligned. Hispanic communities, Black communities. And the same is true in New York and Denver, and- It could add to the chaos perception- Yes- ...on Gaza plus border, which are totally different things, of course, in the sense that Biden can't quite control either."
xCw9Atmx1c-,5175,Unknown,"But anyway, Joe, thank you very much for joining me, and thank you all for joining us on Conversations . View the Conversation > Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts RSS Feed"
u1TkQRBJCS-,5955,Aaron Friedberg,"Right. Well, historically, to the extent that we have pursued a consistent grand strategy, if you like, over long periods of time, those have been rooted in geopolitical calculations, but also in values or ideology. We're not a country that is led by people who are simply cold-blooded calculators of our political interest. Sometimes we have leaders who are more that way than others, but they need to mobilize the American people, and the way that they've done that historically has been on questions of right and wrong or freedom and opposition to authoritarianism and dictatorship. If you don't have a coherent geopolitical view, and you also don't have any adherence to those values, I don't see what the foundation is for a consistent policy or strategy. People who sing Trump's praises and say he's a tough guy and people are afraid of him because they don't know what he might do, and he might take dramatic action, they're not wrong in that, and that can be valuable up to a point. The perception that someone is maybe a little irrational or willing to take risks, let's say... that may be right, but that's not the foundation on which you build, again, a grand strategy that you can hope as a country to continue to pursue over years or decades if that's what's necessary, and it seems to me that that is what's necessary."
f6FJpvESMwK,3622,Doug Sosnik,"But part of the problem Democrats have had is, this whole generation of elected officials have never had the opportunity to step forward and see what they got. I mean, Bill Clinton ran in '91 for president because no one was going to run, because everyone knew Bush was going to get reelected. So Clinton ran. Well, Clinton was able to demonstrate, because of that opportunity, that he had the right stuff. But you look at the 2016 field that was primary in Trump, and all these people were strong on paper, and they just didn't have the right stuff. But you can't find this stuff out without an opportunity. And this is a party that has not given people an opportunity now for over two decades. Yeah. It does mean that we have this incredibly polar both... It's funny, we have both polarization in terms of the two World War I trench warfare sort of situation, and status quo or a static situation at the top. Where we're literally seeing the renomination of one 80-year-old president, and the renomination of the preceding previous president from the other party who's 77. So has there ever been a kind of more, I don't know what you'd call it, a backward looking situation? To have two massive phalanxes each being led by people more than 75."
P3I91CVjQlF,5664,AB Stoddard,"That's all fine. But I think if you get out there and you carpet bomb in the face of the assault on our system that we're facing, something will stick. And that's why I think the idea of having some kind of rotating voices on a unified message, like my whiteboard idea is that you can get a mother who is affected in a measles outbreak one week and the next a senator. But it always comes back to the idea that you needed government more than you knew. They're decimating it in a reckless way. They didn't plan this. They didn't poll test it, they didn't consult experts. It was all completely capricious. And that will drive home that your taxpayer dollar is basically being stolen. I mean, your concerns are not at the top of the Doge efficiency agenda or Trump's either. And they don't have to get into lofty talk about democracy. They don't have to talk about Elon's connections to Putin, Trump's selling out to Putin. I get that, they tried that last year. Fine, let other people do that. So they can do kitchen in a much more, I think politically potent and compelling way than they're right now. Yeah, and I think imaginative way too, right? I mean, Yeah, they're too... Anyway, we will see if they take some of this advice and it feels like they're going in that direction a little bit, but they always want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good."
C0dQQkNrohU,6268,Jack Goldsmith,"But I don't know how it's going to work during the Trump administration. I just don't know if it's going to be any counterforce at all. And the president always needs these counter forces. It is good for the presidency to have to justify itself to the Justice Department, the White House have to justify itself to the Justice Department, to the Congress. These inside-the-government constraints and checking points, going back to Madison's vision, frankly, are so vitally important to keeping the president on the right track. Presidents without constraints end up doing badly and hurting themselves. So we'll see what role Congress plays in this context. Is that the question you had in mind? I'm not sure what you meant by [inaudible]. I think that last point is so important. I do feel like my sense is that in national security, really Armed Services and Intel, what you described is correct, judiciary, routine domestic policy, I just feel like I'm not sure there's ever hugely great oversight that we would look at pretty closely at the rather unimportant, honestly, education department there in the late 80s. And they didn't like something we were doing, we heard about it. I just get the feeling there's much... And that was bipartisan, it sounded like. We had Republican senators coming down our throat if they didn't like something as much as Democrats."
RtG2_wVvOrf,3196,Eric Edelman,"But if they're cut off from the intelligence and other US assistance, that would make it very tough for them to continue. So the whole Russia-Ukraine situation maybe comes to a head this summer because I think some of those weapons, they'll either have to be renewed or permitted or not, and the intelligence cooperation continues or not. Maybe there would even be an attempt by the friends of Ukraine on the Hill to add aid for Ukraine to end of year appropriations package. That's a big, Iran-Israel... Obviously the US has all kinds of other issues simmering away, you might say, and in our foreign policy. It's interesting. Well, maybe I'll just ask this question to close it. The whole point of America First... I don't like America First, I don't think you like America First, it didn't work in the '20s and '30s and it was really bad when they tried to rehabilitate it suddenly in 1940 to give American excuses to stay out of a war that which already had featured the Nazi conquest of France and an invasion of other countries, and obviously the bombing of Britain. That was the original America first. But whatever everyone thinks of America First, at least, I suppose, the promise of it would be kind of we stay out of these conflicts."
jvFIb0m_NVg,8023,James Carville,"Yeah, I think the backward-looking, ""he's responsible for jobs"" is okay, but the way you put it is good because it's forward-looking, right? I'm going to do this as president in the next four years. And Trump, incidentally, we know what he's going to do. He already had four years to appoint these people. Right, and he can brag on it. He's going to continue to give you the same kind of courts you got right now. The same court restricting rights, the same court of ethical calamities after another, the same partisanship. I mean, for almost all our lives Bill, the Supreme Court was never a big issue. We'd talk about it, the partisans, ah it was good for fundraising, it gets the base excited. All right, then let's move on to something else. Now it's become an enormous issue. And the other thing I would do, and I'm trying to encourage it and I think I'm going to get it done, is an entire 10-page piece of research on every effort that Republicans have tried or said they wanted to get rid of birth control. Because I got news for you, birth control is popular out there. Those pills, the people like them. And you got to drive it home. You got to keep them answering. You got to keep Trump off guard."
mKEqxQkbLnr,8190,Robert Kagan,"And not just about Donald Trump, but by the movement that Donald Trump represents. That movement did not control the Reagan administration. They were basically fed crumbs from the table during the Reagan years and ended the Reagan years very disillusioned by the Republican Party. Pat Buchanan leaves the party in '92, right? Well, later in the '90s. He runs the nomination twice, but he runs against the Republican establishment. Absolutely. But he runs against Republican establishment, and so the idea of the uniparty really is prevalent in the Reagan years, and it's just unfortunate. Americans are so, again, present-ist. They just don't see the patterns and they really can't tell the difference between your normal Republican-Democratic race and what's happening this year. I would say that's certainly true of Republicans, but it's also true, unfortunately, of many Democrats. Well, hopefully they'll all read your book and then we'll be in a better situation. I'm sure it'll change everything. Yeah, that too is a liberal myth about enlightenment, but that's a longer conversation, right? Part of the point of your book is that you can't expect too much enlightenment suddenly, right? Yeah. Anti-liberalism is a strong force in history and a strong force in human psychology, I guess is what you're saying. And the founders saw that, right? They set up all these institutions and they were very worried about their survival because they saw how strong, you stress this point, how strong anti-liberalism was and would remain."
rN1FP56R_AG,5586,Tim Snyder,"It sounds very condescending, but we could win the war on Ukraine without noticing. The amount of help we have to give to the Ukrainians, which would be very significant for Ukraine... I mean, remember the Ukrainian economy is about 1/250 the size of the NATO economies. Russia's about 1/25 the size of the NATO economies. And so if we actually just had a consistent policy, the scale of which wouldn't even be noticeable in our budget, we could win. And they know that. They know that. And so then whenever they get their useful idiots, the relief is so great that it kind of bursts into hilarity. Like, ""Oh, look. These people could crush us with a little finger, but look, they're not going to because we've got Tucker and we've got Nashatrampushka , you know? We've got these people."" And so their relief manifests itself in this kind of hilarity, in this kind of like, ""Oh, well, look. The world is actually set up in such a way that we don't have to win. There are these people who are going to come and help us out."" Eek. Say a few words about Europe. I mean, generally there are crosscutting trends and tendencies in many different nations, and obviously the different nations are very different. But what's your general sense there, and particular things that either alarm you or cheer you up?"
CohNJrVwUJL,13358,Anne Applebaum,"And why would someone like that cave to someone like Donald Trump whom they know is breaking the law and they know is taking power away from Congress. I mean, this to me is really mysterious. We saw some of it in his first term and actually should say, I even wrote about it. I wrote a piece about collusion and why people collaborate back during Trump's first term. And so it's not like I've never thought about this before, but that seems to me the thing that has really accelerated. There's just much more of that than I expected. I really think that's true. And I think it's true throughout society and civil society and business, private sector as well as the Republican senators are the most mind-bogglingly obvious example. Only four of them were needed to stop some of these cabinet secretaries, which would itself have sent a signal about the sub-cabinet appointments and about policy to say nothing of stopping all kinds of actual policies ranging from tariffs to foreign policy. It's not like Senate has no role. But there's been absolutely nothing there. But the business, and I guess it has been for me, just seeing it time and time again, and people would say, ""Well, Bill, when he really goes after the stuff that effects business directly, that's when they'll step up."
ZU-M1_meaGC,7916,Robert Kagan,"So this is a time of hyper-consciousness about race and a real desire to limit the American population as much as possible to the original, basically Anglo-Saxon, Protestant that was the majority when the country was founded, to the point where the Ku Klux Klan has... what the people call the Second Ku Klux Klan has got millions of supporters. It has branched out beyond racism, which was the early Klan, which was basically re-fighting the Civil War. So it isn't... the Ku Klux Klan of the '20s is anti-black, but it's also anti-Catholic and it's also anti- Jewish. And it is not just a southern phenomenon, it's a national phenomenon. And the amazing thing about the Klan in this period is that it's pretty much a respected civic organization in America. Politicians think nothing of going and speaking at Klan rallies. And the Klan claims many, many, any number, a couple of dozens of congressmen who it claims as members. And so we've completely forgotten about this period, but it's an example of the fact that you can go backwards. It isn't just steady progress. And what undid that triumph of white anti-liberalism were events, not just education, or not even... people didn't change. The Depression discredited the Republican and conservative movement, followed by World War II, which discredited racism, and really led to a huge flowering of liberalism in the wake of what had been a very dominant anti-liberal 1920s."
I9D0dCiMfQm,10258,James Carville,"And when you watch him, that rally in Georgia I think is significant because he didn't fill it up and he blamed Georgia State- a well-known liberal, coastal, elite institution. But the people were walking out and his reaction is, ""I got to keep them. I'll just get crazier."" And so he's like Brian Kemp. Okay, who's you know, Brian Kemp is Karl Rove's kind of wet dream of what a modern Republican should be. And he's just like savaging the guy. You could see he's trying to do anything he can to keep the crowd and keep them on their feet and keep them motivated. And like I say, he's an old comedian. Punchlines just don't work like they used to and he's just struggling. And do you think it'd be hard for him to regain his balance? I mean, it's hard to know, right? All I can say is we need to do everything we can to keep him off his balance, not predict if he can get his balance back. And I think the debates are golden opportunities because he doesn't want to do it. He does not want do it. He's got too much at risk. It's a multiracial female that he's got to go against and Vance is going to have to debate Walz and Walz is going to..."
R0lpHBtcjWg,7131,AB Stoddard,"You've covered the Democrats so long. What is with the polling stuff? They're just obsessed with polling in a very Silly way. They're very tied to data. I agree with you. And look, they literally have nothing left to lose. That's how bad it is. Once they realize that, I think they'll take more chances and they'll be more creative. And I do think that you lead by example. The Booker thing was inspired. I mean, I'm sorry. He stopped eating food on Friday. He stopped drinking water on Sunday. He planned it. He broke this segregationists' record. He talked the whole time about John Lewis and all this uplifting stuff he talked about scripture with another senator, Chris Coons. I mean, it made for good YouTube, it made for good TikTok and it was very smart. And people will see the energy that came from that and they'll be willing to try other things. And also they desperately need new leaders. So let a thousand voices bloom. I mean, Jason Crow is from Colorado. One of the things he's been doing is going on TV and basically talking about where he's from. He wants people to go into red areas. He worked construction, he served in the military. He knows what it's like to struggle to find healthcare coverage, to get a job where that would be provided."
mJbOftUa0Nd,6178,Jack Goldsmith,"This is the thing I worry about the most. It would be wonderful, and this is naive, it's going to seem naive, it would be wonderful if they meant what they said when they said they're going to stop the lawfare. And they've spoken in two sides of their mouths on this, and I don't expect them to go in there and do nothing. And it doesn't take much, by the way. It just takes opening an investigation to really wreck people's lives. You don't have to actually bring them to prosecution. This is the thing I worry about the most, that we're going to have the next round of lawfare, that it is going to be ratcheted up like the next rounds tend to be. And it just depends on what they want to accomplish. I think it will actually damage their administration if they're too aggressive on this stuff, because it's going to hurt the integrity of the Department and the reputation of the Department before courts and things like that. But this is what I worry about the most, because the Justice Department is in bad shape right now, is in really bad shape for a whole bunch of reasons, some deserved, some not deserved. And that would be terrible for the country in my view and for the idea of apolitical justice."
G9VwSfEOYC4,5919,Larry Summers,"And they're each very serious in their own way, so maybe let me take them in sequence. There are different patterns with which markets trade. There's a classic bastion pattern, which is the pattern that I associate with the United States. Sometimes the world gets risky. When the world gets risky or problematic, stocks go down and people buy bonds as insurance, and they buy the dollar as insurance. And that's the pattern. And sometimes the world gets riskier and stocks go down and bond yields go down and the dollar goes up. Sometimes the world gets safer and stocks go up and bond yields go up and the dollar goes down. That's the pattern of a bastion. There's a different pattern, which is the pattern of a suspect emerging market. That's a place where people either feel good about it or they feel bad about it. That's the experience of the typical Latin American country. That's the experience of the typical developing country. That's why a central thing you watch is do you start having days when interest rates are going up and the currency is going down even though interest rates are going up? Because when that happens, that's a sign that people just don't trust you and they've stopped trusting you. And so, you make inferences not just from what's happening in markets to which way an individual security is moving, but from a correlation pattern across markets."
XAvjqw4JqCF,15550,Anne Applebaum,"Are we a kleptocracy in an oligarchy like the Russians? Is that what we are now? I am not 100% sure that everybody wants to see their country that way. It's one thing to have an America that wants to be a good and nice country and sometimes fails, which we could say was the case in recent years. And it's another thing to be a country that is overtly bad. I mean, overtly seeks to help other dictatorships destroy other societies and seeks to... whose leaders are looking out for their own financial interests and don't care about the prosperity of their own people. I mean, we're then shifting into being something very different. I don't know that all Americans want that. My guess is no. No, I think that's well said. And a very important point. I mean, the dangers you well know, and you've written about this, is at some point there'll be a reaction, I think. A huge amount of damage could be done before the reaction takes hold. We're having a race, in my view, between a... I think a reaction has begun against Trump and against Musk. And a lot of it is just based on more common sense, what are they doing with the government and why are they treating people this way?"
Aq7TFTpGm-t,4903,Tim Snyder,"If we want that, the Americans are going to have to come in and help. What about domestically though in Europe? I mean, how worried do you about Orbanism? I mean, some countries seem... Czech Republic, very impressive, sort of repudiated a Trumpy type president. They've got half a million Ukrainians who seem to be doing fine. There's not much resentment so far as from what I can tell. They're being treated well and so forth. Hungary, kind of Orbanism, where do you see the domestic trends there? Yeah, that's interesting. Because if you take it as a whole, it's kind of like the US, where you have a strong and increasingly organized minority, which is pro-Russia, pro-Putin, pro-Russian victory, pro-fascist. And it's not a majority anywhere, but, on the scale of Europe as a whole, it's significant and it occupies certain important posts, like for example, the post of prime minister in Hungary. And from those posts, it can cause disproportionate damage or it can slow things down. And then a couple more of those posts. And then you've got real problems. Again, it's like the US. You don't have to have a majority which is anti-Ukraine, but you have to have a few blockers in position, which is what Putin is aiming for and what he hopes for."
PXoSDo00m4j,5455,Aaron Friedberg,"South Korean- there's been an open discussion about that in South Korea and Japan. It's more of a taboo subject, but less than it once was. So there are kind of quieter conversations about that going on. And again, a world in which the United States has pretty clearly been defeated and Russia has succeeded with the help of China is one in which confidence in American security guarantees can only go down, and leaders are going to have to think about how to fend for themselves. And with the help of Iran, I mean, I think if you're Saudi Arabia, you don't have as nearly as direct as stake in this as other countries. The effects might be a little more indirect, but I don't know, do you really think if the US won't go to any extra trouble to help a country that's bordering NATO and is democracy in Europe, a place we've been committed to forever and willing to risk NATO for this because we don't want to just send more arms to Ukraine, what is, I don't know, do they really think we're a viable partner? Suddenly the Saudis, I think get less interested in a defense deal with us and more interested in their own nuclear program conceivably, right? They might be friendly with Trump and they're busy giving money to his family and all this, so maybe they could buy them off short term, but I guess that's the thing."
YwKmzLKU_iV,6449,Jack Goldsmith,"Now, the Trump people are saying they're going to come back in and get rid of the PC stuff and make it focused as a fighting force. And that's their theory of the case, is that DOD has gotten too far away of being a fighting force and they're going to restore it to that. So I'm not in a position to sort that out. Here's what I worry about the most, and it's on the intelligence side. The people that the president has, and the president himself says he wants to reform the intelligence community, the FBI and the DNI and maybe the NSA, maybe the CIA, and get rid of people. There's talk of ending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. There's talk of ending Section 702. These are two absolutely critical laws that are at the core of our national security and our ability to protect ourselves from national security. If they wipe those out, either by overruling them by statute, which they won't be able to do, or just by the structural deregulation I was talking about, hollowing them out from the middle, I'm confident that would have a bad impact on our national security. Just the way that when Stansfield Turner under Jimmy Carter became the CIA director and fired 900 human intelligence officers following the Church Commission, which led us to be blind in Iran and Afghanistan and other places."
rX__viK2K3X,2286,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That people should wait to come here legally. That was sort of the- Maybe, but they can't wait legally at this point. That's the whole thing. There is literally no way for them to get a Green Card. And even if they were to go back to their home country, they would be barred from reentering for 10 years and would likely not be eligible for any form of status. Of course, many people think anyone around the world can just apply to live in the United States. That truth couldn't be any further from that. It is virtually impossible for the vast majority of the world to get a visa. Getting a visa, you have to either have to fall within a very limited family- based category. So are you a close nuclear family relative of a US citizen, or you have to have a job offer and usually some form of advanced degree to come here. So we have a legal immigration system, where if you're a computer programmer, you can get a visa. If you're the world's best electrician or plumber, you cannot, there's no legal visa for trades people, for example, which is actually a big concern for the United States as we have some issues hiring and recruiting for the trades. But that's a whole separate issue."
2ohtQ___Xdl,5564,Aaron Friedberg,"Wow. And we talked about a week ago or 10 days ago, and one reason I wanted to have this conversation was the comment you made, you were walking through some of this stuff just very quickly with me, and then I think you said something like, ""But of course the biggest source of instability or concern right now is probably our election,"" not any of these actual, not to minimize these foreign policy developments... but not simply these foreign policy developments. And so let's get to our election and the choice we face, explain that. One can imagine the dangerous world and we've had it in the past. And a U.S. that's ready to deal with it. Or maybe not ready to deal with it, but that in any cases, on a certain path, that's kind of established and set. That's not the case now, Right. I don't know that I would say that the United States is the biggest source of instability, but the biggest source of uncertainty right now I think we know what all of the other actors we've been talking about are going to do over the next six months, year. They're probably going to continue along the path they've been following. The biggest uncertainty is what we're going to do. And I think that does depend on the outcome of our election."
hciHTMKs0dH,14208,Anne Applebaum,"But you also do have to have a path forward. They can't just be going back to the- No, we can't go back. No, they need to be defended and reimagined. After Trump, assuming there is an after Trump, there is a different kind of leader next time, we will have to have a different kind of Justice Department. We'll have to rethink what it does. What does the FBI do? By what rules does it operate? All those things are going to require an enormous amount of creativity and imagination. Let's hope we can... Well, you certainly can help and I hope we can all help some people use that creativity and imagination some. Anne, thank you so much for taking the time today. And it's really important, I think, and stimulating conversation. Thanks, always a pleasure. Be well. I'll see you soon in-person, I trust, here in DC or elsewhere. Yep. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
QaE6xOAnFLq,6717,Aaron Friedberg,"And so explain that in more, why isn't this just the normal Bush, V. Kerry in 2004? There's always been some uncertainty and some differences in opinion about what we should be doing during the Cold War and during the post-Cold War era. But is this like that, or something more fundamental? No, I think the range of possibilities, if Trump comes back, the range of possible policies in each of these areas and across other domains too, is just much wider than would have been typically the case in the past, particularly obviously we're talking about foreign policy. So the range of possibilities there is quite wide. We can talk about Harris, there are uncertainties about what she would do, but I think the range of uncertainty there is fairly narrow compared to what is the case with Trump. And that has partly to do with his past record and partly to do with uncertainty about who exactly would emerge around him and who might have influence over policy in a second Trump administration. And some of those people, at least in their expressed views and their past track records, are maybe closer to a kind of conventional, traditional Republican hardline approach to foreign and defense policy. And some of them are completely different. Some of them really are isolationists, and I don't think anyone can say with assurance if there are such groups, which one is going to emerge dominant."
3aorh5ifpra,8812,James Carville,"I mean, they've won elections before. And what's coming out of there is... you're right, they don't know where to go. They let it get away from them. It was like they got hit in the... And they were totally... They didn't see this coming? I mean, if you and I were running that campaign, I'd say, ""Bill, three things can happen. Biden dropped out, it's Harris. Biden drops out, it's an open thing."" But you would have a plan that you would pull off the shelf. You would be ready for that or you would anticipate it. From what little bit I can read, they were just standing there feeling good about themselves and then they got hit in the mouth and they didn't have... There was no concerted organized thought out reaction, which is pretty amazing. It really is. I guess it's a piece with the overconfidence that went with picking Vance at the Republican Convention. I mean, one thing is how fast it all happened. Trump assassination attempt, Saturday, was the 13th of July. Convention begins the 15th. Vance has picked the 15th. Trump gives a speech on the Thursday, Biden out on the Sunday, and people as late as that Wednesday, Thursday, I think I did [David Axelrod and Mike Murphy], we were all slightly down on the dumps that the move to persuade President Biden to step aside, which we've all been involved in, was not going to succeed."
7z8m8dwx8hS,5530,Aaron Friedberg,"I feel like Biden's maybe aired a little bit more on the- Yes. ...Things are getting better side of it. And it puts Harris in a slightly tricky position here, I think. Right, yeah. Two things. One, there is the rhetorical issue and then there the concrete issue, I'm thinking particularly of defense spending. And yes, on the rhetorical side there is a desire to say things are getting better and there is obviously going to be a desire on the part of the opponent to say, oh, the world's going to hell in a hand basket and it's because of this administration. Well, the world may be going to hell in a hand basket, but it's not primarily because of what we're doing or not doing. It's because of these external factors and the character of these regimes. So this claim that things are getting better or the inclination to say that also frames the problem in the wrong way as a short-term thing that can be brought under control and we can go back to business as usual. And my own view is that's not an accurate presentation, and it's not solely or primarily because of any failings of the current administration. It's because of the way these other powers are evolving. And I believe I said this in one of our prior conversations that Biden had an opportunity, there was a moment there after the start of the Ukraine war, after the beginning of the Russian invasion, when he could conceivably have gone to Congress and said, as Truman did after the North Korean invasion of the South in June, 1950, ""This is an extremely dangerous, a newly dangerous situation, and we have enemies and so on, and therefore we need to make dramatic increases in the resources that we devote to defense among other things over an extended period of time."" And I think he probably would've gotten support for that from people on both sides of the aisle."
WBcgnj2ws6g,17046,Anne Applebaum,"We've removed funding from other independent Russian media. These are organizations that can bring the truth about the war to Russia, which also has an impact on how people feel and how the war is perceived there. We are slowly dismantling sanctions simply by not updating them. So a sanctions regime requires constant shifts and changes as the Russians find ways around old restrictions. We aren't updating those anymore. That's been reported both in the media, but it's also been, there was a big Senate report about it a few days ago as well. So at the same time, we don't see the administration talking about new aid, either new military aid or any other kind for Ukraine at all. So we see the US slowly backpedaling, slowly removing restrictions. We see a prolonged negotiation that has no result so far and simply allows the Russians to spin out this game, whatever game it is that they're playing with Trump. That's what I see. Yeah, that's very helpful and comprehensive. I mean, one question, well two questions I guess, one is just how much do you think, and there's one more Ukraine-specific and the war-specific, the drying up of USAID, it doesn't seem to have quite as bad an effect of some of us feared. I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more."
bkFUImLyPRj,9844,James Carville,"This is the choice and let's roll. Final question. Speaking of VP candidates, I have a hunch that Vance could hurt actually the Trump ticket a little more than people think. Normally, VPs don't matter much as we've been... I think that's the conventional wisdom, except maybe for '92 I think where you guys were helped by the Gore pick. And '80, which I do think Bush helped Reagan as a kind of taking the edge off the charge of extremism. But do you agree that Vance is weird enough to use Walz's term that it not only doesn't help Trump but could actually hurt him? Well, I do because I don't think we're through finding out things about JD Vance. Okay. As I say, I think there are more shoes in that closet. And like today he gave a book blurb to Jack Posobiec. Oh, that guy. Yeah. I mean, all right, this is some [inaudible] stuff, dude. Let me tell you. And I know people ask me to do a book blurb and I'm very generous about book blurbs. No, this is like, you do the basic stuff. So somebody say, ""Hey, James. I'm professor of political science at UCSD, and can you do a book blurb?"" And I'll look up the guy and okay, he looks all right."
7KLdbSUr5Qr,7097,AB Stoddard,"And I see... you mentioned Ukraine, and it is a good issue Democrats should exploit to divide Republicans. Trump is using some occasional tough talk on Putin, and he's going at this plan that he said was only going to take one day to bring peace to the region, which we all know means give a bunch of territory to the Russians. But I was interested to see Senator Cornyn, who was competing for the majority leader position against Senator Thune tweet...He picked up a line from a Wall Street Journal editorial board writing about the fact that Putin is not interested in a peace deal, and the line is the Russian dictator is stringing President Trump along over a 30-day ceasefire Ukraine has already accepted. And in it, he says he doesn't want peace. He doesn't want a deal. And so, it was interesting to me that Roger Wicker has been a little louder on-Senator from Mississippi-on Russia. Of course, Mitch McConnell has all along. And then now another Senator, Senator Cornyn. Senator Murkowski has been outspoken all along. She's an outlier, obviously. I was really disappointed in their whole reaction to this national security breach, we'll call it, because they invited a civilian journalist into an insecure chat about war plans. And this ""Signal gate"" is just a little more than a week old, and Republicans looked the other way."
1O1TSMNMks0,17257,Anne Applebaum,"We'll talk about all those topics and update people, even if we can't entirely cheer them up. Well, thanks for having me. Always pleasure to talk to you, whether in real life or via Zoom. No, both are good. Okay. So you've been to Ukraine several times, obviously you know it very, very well. Been to it before obviously the war, then since the war, you're right there. You're spending a fair amount of time in Poland right across the border. So what's your sense of the actual situation on the ground in the war in Ukraine? So first of all, yeah, I'm in Poland now. I'm in Western Poland though, so not exactly near the front line, but still. I was last in Lviv a few months ago. I was there in the spring, and I'm actually supposed to go to Kyiv in September. I mean, I think one of the remarkable stories, and this is not very well told in the US, is that not that much has changed. Despite this kind of constant drumbeat of crisis and danger, and the Russians are going to take Pokrovsk, which is a big fortress town in Donbas, the Russians move forward very, very slowly. They are moving, but I was told at the current rate, they will take all of Donbas in something like four and a half years."
n2wUvgKRKl4,8480,James Carville,"I have a record to build on, not to sit on, we've created foundation by chips and new green energy projects,"" and anything like that, but have some future conclusion that it's all going to get better. And that's pretty urgent that they start saying that, you think? President Biden sometimes says, ""Well, people don't focus until the fall,"" and all this, but I don't know. I hear that all the time. And I'm sure that people come in and say that, and people say, ""The average American spends four minutes a day worrying about politics,"" or, "" No one is going to decide until after they all go to the shore,"" and they won't decide until they come back from the shore or they go to the Hamptons. After they go to the Hamptons, they're going to decide. No, they're watching and they're absorbing what's going on around them. And I've heard all of these theories about when voters decide and don't decide. Our big problem, the Democrats' big problem, is I don't see how we can replicate the 2020 coalition. Under 30 was 17% of the share, in other words, 17 out of 100 people who voted in 2020 were under 30. And of that, President Biden got 62%. Black was 12% share: about every 100 people that voted that were black, Biden got 90%."
MFBRVqt4iLv,15783,Anne Applebaum,"I always say what you said, and I think it is right: they have actual responsibilities running a country, and they have to do what they think is right in terms of not only their own country, and that's obviously important, but also in terms of helping it, really helping Ukraine. And Trump's going to be president for the next three and a half years so people like me can say, this is horrible, but they have to say, ""Oh, we can make it work, I guess."" Now, but you're saying, I'm just curious, I mean, you're saying they understand, A, And B, I'm curious if that goes beyond this particular rung of leaders to sort of a European elites more generally? And C and relatedly, how good do you feel about the general political situation in Europe? They've been these spurts of alarm maybe justified about the far right and AFD at one point, and that other countries have their own. Feels to me like that's subsided a little bit, but maybe that's just because there's an election in the next month or two. I don't know. So generally, give me your sense of that in Europe. So yes, it's widespread. It includes the UK, it includes, I don't know, people like the Poles and the Czechs and the Romanians."
SAjSQgWODQB,2556,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"I mean, I guess, legally, could they say, ""You, 10, we're proceeding now to expel you, the other 68, just go back to your jobs,"" or something like that? I mean, because they've talked some about focusing on criminals, and then the recent legislation that's now-actually this week in the Senate-focus changes the definition of criminal from convicted of a crime to accused of a crime. We can get back to that if you want, but leaving that aside from it, is it possible that they could boast in three months, and truthfully boast, I guess, in three months, that they've expelled X number of criminals or accused criminals? Well, even people who have been accused or convicted of a crime, who are undocumented, they also have to go through the immigration court system. So that depends on their circumstance- You can't kick them out if you find someone who's got a black mark on his record? Yeah. Yeah, unless they have already been ordered deported in the past, and that is actually a fair number of people. There are many people who have been deported at some point in the last 30 years, and then re-entered and are in the country with a prior order of removal on their record. These are the people that can be deported very quickly because all they have to do from an administrative perspective is they do what's known as reinstating the order of removal."
oOCQNfJWvIT,9343,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't believe he's lost a step mentally. I just spoke to someone, a member of Congress, who was with him just a few days ago and said it's not that he doesn't know what's going on, he's not confused, but he's really tired, he speaks more slowly. At the State of the Union he was shouting, he was obviously on some Red Bull, then the next day his voice was hoarse. He went straight to Wisconsin and he was tired. There's a reason... and people say, ""Oh, he doesn't do anything until 10:00 and then he stops at 04:00."" Well, Trump never showed up at work. He didn't come down until 12:00. He watched every single cable show and then screamed to people on the phone for half the day. Joe Biden can actually do this job without working that much. It's just that in a presidential campaign, when you're doing things like you're going on a lot of airplanes and you're going to events at night and stuff, it shows his age. So when I think about the fact that he's so tired now, that he's visibly aged so much since the campaign began in 2019, that he's not going to be able to hide in the basement. Intuitively, I just feel that he might not be on the ticket in November of 2024."
gMZ-qtQeMkI,5761,Tim Snyder,"I'm sorry to say this, but he's turning the Republican Party into a personality party. When it's like you've got people with the same last name as you who are supposed to run it, and it's going to fund you? It becomes then a personal institution like a fascist party. But if you don't have the vocabulary, then it's harder to criticize that. Anyway, I'm taking your point. Look, there are many different kinds of fascism, and that's not an observation one would necessarily get out of the Arendtian tradition. Yeah. On your point, for me, Ukraine is the most important issue in American domestic politics, partly because it really is such an important issue for the world in many ways, and therefore for America. But also because it's so revelatory, it seems to me, about people's actual views about America. Almost a little more than America itself, where you can find excuses not to see certain things, or there's someone... You know what I mean? Yeah. This is so clear cut. Yeah, I agree. It's a litmus test, and there aren't... The interesting thing is it doesn't ever really go wrong. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, and I will tell you what you think about voter suppression. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, I will tell you what you think about a whole range of other issues."
82COVT4-8C5,7578,Robert Kagan,"Yeah, no, he was respectable. He ran for office. He was a great peace advocate. He was an isolationist, but I would think he would've said he was an advocate of peace. And he was Henry Ford, he revolutionized the American economy. No, he was a big figure. And I think it's important, he was on the extreme end of antisemitism, I would say, but he was not so extreme that he was read out of society by any stretch of the imagination. I think that just goes back to thinking that, I don't know whether people forget it or not, is how prevalent antisemitism and how accepted antisemitism was in the first half of the 20th century. I was reading recently again, rereading, Edith Wharton, The House of Mirth , which is a wonderful book and has so many wonderful qualities about it. The antisemitism in it is mind-boggling. It is as pure as it can be that the characterization of Jews in that book is just horrific. And that was routine. I think in most works of literature in that period you see very casual antisemitism. The interesting thing about that is that that was an increase in antisemitism following the great immigration influx of the 1890s. Antisemitism was not a big part of 19th century America, but it became a big part of 20th century America as, again, the white Anglo- Saxon Protestant, still majority in America at that time was getting very nervous about what it meant to be an American, and really set out to define more clearly what it meant to be an American."
RwTEpSL6weN,6342,Tom Tugendhat,"And then we can get to some of the economic questions as well. Well, I mean, look, we're doing a lot more than we were doing a few years ago. I mean, you touched on the fact, Bill, that I'd spoken about Putin before. I mean, I took over the chairmanship, I was elected to chair the Foreign Affairs Committee in 2017. And one of the first reports that we started work on, we published the report in May, 2018, I think it was, it was called Moscow's Gold, in which we exposed the threat of Russian corruption in the city of London. Now we're talking about the city of London, actually, you could talk about many other jurisdictions, sadly, including your own where dirty Russian money flows through financial institutions. And it's not a threat in the sense that it's a huge amount of money that could bring down the US or UK economy. That's not the threat, the threat is that it spreads poison throughout it and it corrupts all that it touches. It corrupts business people, it corrupts banks, it corrupts politicians who get involved with it. It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia."
6ruGc6q8u5O,5688,Tim Snyder,"These are people who like the fact that Russia's killing lots of Ukrainians. They like the fact that Russia's trying to prosecute a genocide. They like the fact that Russia's pushing for a world where might makes right. They like that. There's a certain number of Americans who like-people around the world, people who are not Americans who matter in America-who like this. And that is unfortunately the appeal of, I'm going to use the word fascism. That fascism is about saying, ""Look, it's all about the one guy. It's all about this one guy who's beyond history. Look at him. He's breaking all the rules."" And yes, of course there's killing involved, but that's necessary. It's a normal. It makes us feel good. And that's what we're dealing with now. It's a big part of what we're dealing with. And although it's not always explicit on the Trump side of things, it's also part of the Trump side of things, where Trump is about how there's a strong man. It's all the succession of strong men. He doesn't pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He's kind of a link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it's ultimately about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in Ukraine, there's so much bloodshed, is clarifying."
fWKMQS_3js6,4020,Doug Sosnik,"Secondly, Obama, who got elected, is essentially challenging the Democratic establishment. When he got elected president, he didn't care about the Democratic party. He didn't care about democratic candidates. He never took all his data file of millions of supporters and went to the DNC. The Democrats made historic losses in 2010 due to the negligence, and over the course of eight years of Obama, Democrats lost almost 1,000 state legislative candidates, got eviscerated in the house and the Senate, controls of these legislatures, and so really the 2010s was a lost generation, a lost decade for Democratic elected officials across the country, and as I said earlier, fed this lost generation. Now, since, I would say, lastly, since 2016, so we're clocking in now eight years, the organizing principle of the Democratic Party has not been what you're for, but what you're against, and it's been a party that's been organized singularly to deal and beat with Donald Trump. And so, you've got this sort of mishmash of forces that have been building, that are going to explode the day after the election, about what does it mean to be a Democrat? I mean my slight-maybe caveat, I don't know what you think of this-of that count, which is very, very interesting. I mean particularly I want to say how important it is what you say about the sort of Clintons and then Obama/Biden dominating for so long, that they did probably suppress a whole generation of people who we know even who've left office by now, they rose and fell."
RDWYZHfE6Gu,13782,Anne Applebaum,"These ads are being put up saying, essentially, I mean I'm paraphrasing, ""Join ICE if you want to be tough and beat people up."" And you're creating almost like a paramilitary organization, which doesn't have a culture of rule of law and isn't loyal to anybody, again, except for the president. And, again, I'm sure there were police force in Alabama in 1920 might've looked something like that, or even more recently. But at the federal level, we have never had this. We never had a national interior ministry police, which is what this is. That's something you associate with communist countries, with fascist countries or with countries that have very, very different political traditions. No, it is really startling. And of course, one problem, just picking up what you said about, not only have you lost all these people from government and lost the culture and the traditions, you now have these people embedded. And so, let's assume the most wonderful person, whoever it would be, is elected president. There is a free and fair election, fair enough, and Trump loseS it and someone succeeds Trump. Could be a anti-Trump Republican, it could be a pro-liberal democracy Republican, it could be a pro-liberal democracy Democrat, it could be a coalition ticket, whatever. What do they do? I mean, people do not appreciate this."
39WWQNxpx1f,5662,Tim Snyder,"Germany is very, very slowly, too slowly, very slowly going in the right direction. And then you have the French who have been basically... Macron has seen, as generations of French leaders before him have seen, when there's a moment of American weakness, that's a moment when France can play a disproportionate role. And Macron, I think he's doing exactly the right thing in exactly the right rhetoric, and I'm glad he is doing it, but it's really striking that the Gaullist moment arrives when the Americans are busy doing nothing. But what Macron... I mean, the French are doing less than other countries, but what Macron is saying now is very important because he's the one who's saying, ""This is very clear morally, and this is also very clear strategically,"" and he's right about those things. So I think the Europeans can get the Ukrainians through this year without a disaster. But if we want the Ukrainians to win, and if we want... We haven't really talked about this, but there are all these strategic gains which the US gets by Ukraine winning. If we want that, the Americans are going to have to come in and help. What about domestically though in Europe? I mean, how worried do you about Orbanism? I mean, some countries seem... Czech Republic, very impressive, sort of repudiated a Trumpy type president."
PDeUnB0LcO7,2449,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah, so a year ago, the situation was very different. In December of 2023, we saw 250,000 border patrol apprehensions, the highest number on record. I will note as a little bit of a historical aside, it's not clear if that actually is the highest number of people who've ever crossed in a given month because 20, 30, 40 years ago, we had far less situational awareness of how many people were crossing. Border patrol only apprehended, according to some estimates, about one in three people who were crossing. In fact, it wasn't until 2012 that we actually took the majority of people crossing the border into custody. But setting that aside, 250,000 was an extraordinarily high number. And then last month, the last month of border patrol data we have from November, there were 46,000 people taken into custody. So it is less than a fifth of the border patrol apprehensions compared to a year ago. And that gives you some sense of the change that has happened with the Mexican crackdown and the actions that President Biden took in June. There are still about 250,000 or more migrants waiting in Mexico. Many of them are registered through the CBP One app, attempting to seek legal entry through a port of entry. And the Biden administration's carrot and stick policies seem to have shifted some behavior."
5QcJOOU-IXp,8852,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary? I guess not. It just makes me so sick. I wrote that for The Bulwark months ago. They're not allowed to say that he didn't win the election. Chris Sununu says that, Chris Christie says that. Mike Pence says things like, ""I didn't do what he wanted me to do because I didn't have the constitutional authority to on January 6th,"" and will always disagree, but he doesn't like to come out and say, ""We lost the election."" He really avoids that. But you shouldn't incite mobs. It's the story of the Capitol. But they won't even, they will not even criticize January 6th. So not only will they not say he lost, they will not say he definitely tried to steal an election, he plotted a two-month coup, he incited a deadly a riot where people died. They won't touch January 6th. They won't touch his coup plotting. And so the message they're sending everybody is that it's okay. And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day."
MpxRqWo9IqC,10204,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
T5vv4JRuyoj,2651,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Nevertheless, they'll still be able to use that propaganda to say, ""We are protecting Americans."" And to emphasize, I think a few other points on here, of course, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not criminals. The undocumented population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born American citizens. Same is true for legal immigrants because people of course, sensibly, do not want to show up on a government radar and generally don't like to stick their heads up. And the undocumented population is really part of every community. And if they actually did manage to round everybody up, it could have really devastating impacts on the United States economy in particular with massive spikes in inflation, a drop overall of the economy. We estimated if 11 million people are deported, we estimated GDP could drop 4.2 to 6.8%, which is as high or higher than the percentage drop during the Great Recession. And the economic implications could be dramatic. But we are in a world right now, days before Trump takes office where we can predict a number of different scenarios, but we can't say which one of them will come true. We can say it's probably unlikely-almost impossible-that 11 million are deported. But given this new world we are in right now, and with the possibility of this massive influx of funding, saying how much they're going to get and how quickly they can ramp up this enforcement, it's still tricky."
hoGOPRXH9uf,6065,Jack Goldsmith,"So we've had a downward spiral of these norms. The Biden pardon is definitely a big step in the downward spiral of the use of the pardon power, because as many people have pointed out, it's going to give Trump cover to do basically whatever he wants. Also, Biden, in the course of that pardon, trashed his justice department for being politicized, which plays into the Trump narrative. So it's a downward spiral of these, whatever you want to call them, norms and expectations of the offices just really becoming inefficacious. Yeah. One thing that struck me about the Biden pardon, which I was not happy about either, if anyone cares... It was, compared to various other pardons of leaders, at the family side of it, but Bush... At the end of George H.W. Bush, I was in that White House with the Vice President Quayle-chief of staff-pardoned people because from Iran-Contra at the very end, but they had mostly, actually not every single one, mostly had pled guilty or been convicted, or they'd been held accountable to some degree. And a very high percentage of pardons, when you think about it, including Clinton's example, which are pretty deplorable, the huge majority of them are cleaning the record as a favor of someone. Maybe you shouldn't do it. It's not quite equitable."
AwOc2eoQ7_s,6865,Tom Tugendhat,"If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty. I think we underestimate that at our peril. No, I think that's very well said, and I mean, the courage plus competence apparently, in leadership. Yeah, totally. And a high level of competence. That's awfully important to people. Like I mean, it happens, and then of course, when things swell, of course, that's how it was going to go, but it didn't have to go that way. No, and you're... Maybe we'll close on this. You were such a critic of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. I mean, think of what the world looks like if Ukraine falls. You know, Zelensky just doesn't make the right decisions, or the Russians make better decisions, and they take the airport near Kyiv, and then it goes, and the whole thing [inaudible] - Or we make the wrong decisions and we don't support it. Very much so, so I mean, what does a world in which we've pulled out of Afghanistan and watched the Taliban take that back over, and then six months later, Ukraine goes under, or part of it, a large part of it, let's say, to a brutal invasion from Putin."
dAvY03yfUxw,9853,Mark Esper,"But I think one thing we all share is we know that there's a responsibility that comes with being Secretary of Defense and for running the Pentagon that says, you are going to be apolitical to the degree that where it matters, certainly for sure. And so there's this sense of apolitical and your responsibility and staying out of politics, particularly for the military. And so that's kind of what brought us together, particularly as things unfolded and as the election denialism continued, there was a growing concern that, would the military get involved? And we all know now that there was that, I guess a meeting in late December with I think maybe it was Mike Flynn and others who said, ""Yeah, maybe we should send the military in to seize ballot boxes or to conduct another election."" I can't recall the details, but it was quite alarming that the military would be put in that context. I was concerned going into the fall that the military would be used at the time of the election when the results were revealed to put down protests to do other things and so that became more of my concern, immediate concern at that point in time. And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did."
b7myNAvkmN9,14692,Anne Applebaum,"I think you might also want to spend a minute thinking about the difference between how ICE is being created, the new ICE, as opposed to how the FBI was originally created back in beginning of the last century. The FBI, which has been a very flawed institution, this is not an advertisement for FBI, but from the beginning it was meant to be the people who were recruited for it were told they were civil servants. There was this idea originally, they were this straight-cut square-jawed G men, and they wore suits and they were trained in a specific way. Again, they violated that and mistakes were made. I don't know. But the DNA of the FBI and the reason why, even in some of its worst years, it continued to attract, again, civic-minded people was because that was the culture of the institution. Look at the way ICE is being created. ICE is the opposite of that. So, people are allowed to wear masks. They don't wear badges, like normal police. They're being recruited in a political way. These ads are being put up saying, essentially, I mean I'm paraphrasing, ""Join ICE if you want to be tough and beat people up."" And you're creating almost like a paramilitary organization, which doesn't have a culture of rule of law and isn't loyal to anybody, again, except for the president."
iI5xYjSuH8f,7734,A.B. Stoddard,"They have erosion with Asians, erosion with Black voters, erosion with Latino voters. And Biden's support among Black voters has dropped 30% in two years. This is really horrible. Presumably, I think the pros will say, ""Well, they'll come back and vote Democratic anyway."" You know what? I think that no, no, it's never that they'll vote Republican. It's that a lot of people will sit this out if they're mad. They didn't get voting rights. They didn't get police reform. There's a lot of frustration among Black voters about the fact that the Democrats always think they can count on their vote. So it's a very serious matter. And I think Democrats in swingier, more competitive environments understand that, that these are close margins, and that Biden's unpopularity is pretty strong across the board. And so that's a problem. On the Republican side, Republicans are having trouble recruiting candidates because they don't want to run next year when Trump is running. And that's a really interesting, hasn't-really-been-talked-about-yet issue. But do you want to run with Donald Trump? Do you want to start a political career and raise the money and run in this environment defending him? It sounds like fun, right? So that's interesting. And the other thing about how crazy this whole environment is, is that Democrats and Republicans, they both feel that the Democrats are likely to take the House and that the Republicans are likely to take the Senate."
dfk4QQVDEtp,7995,Mark Esper,"But if it's something, if you're in a crisis or you need speed, it's not as adept at that. And so in some ways, we're too slow. And that problem, in some ways is dictated by Congress when you talk about weapons procurement, because while the Pentagon can make a decision to buy a new weapon, it still takes 18 to 24 months to program it, to put it into your budget proposal, to send that budget proposal to the hill. And then Congress considers it for a year and then finally passes an authorization bill and end of an appropriations bill. But again, you're talking about two years to bring something to just approve the funding for it, let alone kind of start a production and everything. And that is the biggest challenge or one of the biggest challenges we face these days, and it's been exposed by the war in Ukraine and exacerbated by what's happening in the Middle East that we just simply can't keep pace on the production of arms and ammunition that we need for not just these conflicts, but for, God forbid, a future one with China. Yeah, how worried are you about that? I mean, our friend Eric Edelman, I've done several conversations with him, and he made the same point you just did that particularly the..."
4w9fr66D9Oh,5992,Tim Snyder,"Hopefully things look more promising in November 2024, and maybe we can talk more about the future and about a brighter future. Whereas I think, as you say, so well, I mean this... 2024 could be a real turning point, not just for Ukraine, but for all of us. I mean, couldn't it be a real inflection point in world history? Yeah. And it can still be a good one. It can still be a good one. Yeah. Thanks for reaching out. Tim Snyder, thank you so much for joining me today, and thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
k7rSZJORYT5,16268,Anne Applebaum,"So there was obviously a lot of, let's call it latent extremism there in Germany, unfortunately because of- Well, to be clear, the Russian campaign in Germany is 15 years old. Yeah, fair enough. So that wasn't the recent- It's not something they built just for this moment. This has been going on for a long time. But didn't you think, I guess deep in my heart, I thought, geez, these parties often do better on election day than they do in polls, which people don't like to say that for them. I really feared 25%, which would've, and I'm slightly heartened by the fact that they stayed, they had their solid 20% and they didn't increase it basically. They didn't increase it. Certainly the Musk and Vance interventions didn't increase it. That seems pretty clear. So if you want to be cheered by that, then be cheered. I'm going to be cheered. And I'm cheered by what you say about Merz who dabbled a little too much with a certain kind of nativism and all this during the campaign, and even a tiny bit in a complicated way with working with the AFD. But basically, as you say, is a pretty conventional center-right. And will have the similar coalition to what we've had in recent years in the Grand coalition."
8MxlYSEQ_Lm,3979,Eric Edelman,"He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document. It's sort of, that's also, I suppose, the kind of transactionalism Trump likes, right? Pretty vague about exactly what's promised to whom, a lot of ability to rethink things later on. Maybe he will use the plane as a private citizen after he becomes president. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it. The whole thing has that ring to it. I was amused also, I'll just say, by the fact that it seems to be something they've been trying to dump for four years. No one wanted to buy it. It's both expensive and extremely, I guess, expensive to operate. God know what the expense will be for us to transform it into an actual functioning Air Force One with all the security and other considerations that that involves. But anyway, I think you're right. Yeah, that is the shakedown side. Well, say a word more about that though. Why would the Qatari, why would they be so eager to have Trump's backing or Trump's goodwill?"
x18e8mKyESP,16770,Anne Applebaum,"I don't know. So generally, give me your sense of that in Europe. So yes, it's widespread. It includes the UK, it includes, I don't know, people like the Poles and the Czechs and the Romanians. Everybody, however they feel about it, whatever kind of government they are, including the far-right governments, they understand that there's been a seismic shift and everybody's seeking to adjust to that shift and to figure out how to cope with it. So there's no one who thinks differently. Maybe some like it. I mean, Viktor Orbán in Hungary presumably likes the change in the United States, and he's hoping to profit from it. But he too understands the scale of it. So nobody really doubts that. As for the stability, I don't want to make a general statement because these go election to election and each election is different. There is no question that there is in every European country, maybe one or two exceptions but almost none, here is a far right which is pro-Russian and which in some cases has been funded by Russia, or amplified by Russia on social media, or has had some special relationship with Russia, or with Russian propaganda, just like in the United States. Some of those parties are flirting with or experimenting with MAGA techniques. So they're watching what works in America and they're seeking to bring those tactics to Europe."
ZAHsd466tyM,7196,Invisible Rulers,"Because eroding confidence in institutions and repositioning yourself as the source of authority and trust is good business for somebody who's trying to sell Twitter or Substack subscriptions or whatever. That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else. It's very divided, and that's why that sense of how do we put reality back together? Well, people who believe Elon, when he says that there was, what was it, 50 million in condoms to Gaza or something, that's just wild theories come out of nowhere. And the fact check doesn't reach people. It takes it to another level, as you say, when he's standing in the Oval Office, and then when a whole bunch of government organizations, and he's got huge people in government who want to keep him happy, have a big incentive to these things. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's actually that- And so it's not just Elon, it's the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary of DH, whoever. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's that they can act on them now. So 10:30 this morning was the RFK Jr. confirmation hearing. I assume he sailed through. I assume it went through on party line. Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised when we're done. I doubt it. But now we have a person who has been propagating the vaccines cause autism conspiracy theory leading Health and Human Services."
eLJBBrJT6qN,7166,A.B. Stoddard,"So it's not nothing. I don't know. I get the sense just talking to people, and I include myself in this criticism, that we know it's ultimately a two-party race. We think it's probably going to be Biden versus Trump. We don't quite appreciate how much unhappiness there is out there at that choice. And I think obviously if you think Trump is a total existential threat, you go vote for the alternative, even if he's too old or whatever. And if it's Biden, some of us will do so pretty cheerfully, even though it might be nicer if he were younger. But I don't know, younger voters, as you say, voters who are not connected closely to politics, the chances that they're staying home, I think, starts to go up quite a lot, doesn't it, in a Biden Trump race. That's where I worry about the polling might show Biden up by one or two, but I don't know. Who knows? In 2020 people were energized. Would they be on the Democratic side after various, as you said, grievances with Biden and lack of alarm, a lack of as much alarm as they might have with Trump? Biden was a relief. He was rescuing the country from Trump. Biden's the incumbent now. He's not rescuing the country from Trump."
5-FlYpKMVAI,5596,Tim Snyder,"Yeah, Britain in 1940 is for me, as this war began, has been going on for me, is the one that just stands out. Yeah, right. I mean, there's Czechoslovakia in '38 where the democracy should have helped, but didn't, and then there's Britain in '40 where we should have, and we did. But there aren't that many cases like this where really all we have to do is give them a meaningless percentage of our defense budget and they're going to win. And yet somehow we get ourselves tied up in these incredibly complicated arguments, which really don't even need to happen. And the Ukrainians are understandably befuddled by, and this is our, I think maybe our central strategic weakness and one that the Russians certainly exploit, our everyday assumption that it's all about us no matter what's happening in the world. It must be about America in some sense. And whether you're on the left, whether you're on the right, I think this is kind of our national weakness. And if you assume it's all about you, then you spend a lot of time thinking about how it's all about you, and you get yourself tied up in arguments among yourselves about how it's all about you. Rather than just saying, ""Okay, there are other people in the world who have agency, the Russians have agency, they decided to invade Ukraine, the Ukrainians have agency."
k-nFcyHAamb,2223,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"But that practice of circular migration is gone. That is essentially eliminated because, over the last 30 years, the United States has built up a massive border security infrastructure and legal infrastructure to make those kinds of acts punishable a lot more harshly, and for actually getting across the border, a lot harder to do. In the early 1990s, you could just walk across the border, and you would probably get through. The majority of people crossing made it through on their first attempt. That is not true- These are the people who are dreamers and DACA recipients, and who have been presumably working here or living here and having families here and being undocumented here for decades now at this point, sometimes, or at least quite a long time. Yeah. And that's because when you build walls, you do keep some people out, but you also trap people here. And so that is why the undocumented population grew so dramatically in the 1990s, as border security ramped up, people ended up staying here and in the 2000s. And the undocumented population pretty much grew steadily through the 1980s, 1990s, and then 2000s. Then around 2006, 2007, border numbers started dropping for a couple of different reasons. First, the labor market cooled off. The Great Recession caused a massive drop in construction and other industries that were often employing undocumented immigrants."
WevurAyJdR_,3353,Doug Sosnik,"One is from an economic standpoint; I think they feel more pinched by what's been going on and remember more fondly 2019 with an economy under Trump. The second is, if you look at the polling particularly of swing voters, is the sense that Democrats are just spending way too much money in government, and that's a big part of the problem. And then the third are the, I guess I would call them crime related issues of the border and crime as proxies for a sense of not trusting Democrats. And so as a result of that, I do think the only way that Biden carried Georgia in 2020 and the Democrats held onto the Senate in 2020 was because of Trump, because of Trump on the ballot in 2020 and because of Trump's role in the special elections for the two Senate seats. But that state is still, I think, more leans Republican for those reasons that I cited. And I do think the same is for Arizona, particularly in the case of Arizona and Nevada. You've got a large number of non-whites who are lower educated voters who are moving increasingly towards Trump and the Republicans making it more problematic for Democrats. Yeah, I mean it's a close... Looks like it's going to be a close front thing."
HI8Ek0XR1vw,5266,Larry Summers,"No, that's very interesting and well said. I guess there's a reason this discipline was originally called ""political economy"" and maybe should still be, and you treat it that way certainly. Politics matters a lot for economics and vice versa. What about the international side? I feel there's discussion of Trump's doing this, Trump's raising, lowering tariffs. Then everyone's shocked, gee, the Chinese get to do something too, and the Europeans get to relocate plants and change their own trading and tourist practices or trading practices to some degree. Again, this ties into both politics and economics, but how... You deal with people, you talk to such senior people from abroad all the time. What's your sense of the international economic situation, if I can put it that way? I think that what happens in the United States has profound impacts on the rest of the global economy. I had a student a few years ago who did a study of long-term interest rates in a variety of countries, England, the Euro, Australia, Japan. And what the study found was that long-term interest rates in most countries change more based on Fed monetary policy than based on the central bank of the country in question. So when the Fed moved, that was bigger for Australian long-term interest rates than when the Australian Central Bank moved."
zqIor-b8Oj6,5933,AB Stoddard,"We have to do kitchen table, we can't do this. They can do a lot of things that a lot of different people can do a lot of different things and they speak to different constituencies. It's a very big country and the business types who care about tariffs or consumers who care about tariffs are different from the people who have relatives who have temporary protected status or who know people very well who have temporary protected status. Venezuelans, nations which he's taking away, different from the people who are most outraged about the deportations you mentioned to El Salvador, different from people who care about Ukraine and care about NATO. And there are again, they're sort of, so I don't even have to put my finger on it... Republicans are pretty good at this, I think. They've, over the years, they see that there are different groups that care about different issues and will attack Biden on the border here, will attack them on radical, I don't know, Latinx here and whatever, femin- being bad to men here and college students here, and you know. And you see what gets traction and what doesn't. But again, things get traction to different degrees with different groups. The Democrats want some magic phrase and they sort of hit upon the kitchen table stuff and prices, which is of course a legitimate issue, but a little bit fighting the last war too to some degree and reminds people of Biden and they're sort of surprisingly, yeah, anyway, they overthink."
V4F0ue4k5de,2252,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And I do think politically also, the numbers of people in New York and Boston and so forth who were assembled there, so to speak, and were straining this social services and all that was part of the political effect. So that led to the mass deportations pledge, or at least made it more popular, I guess. So, talk about the undocumented who were here, because that's a big number and different types and different people who've been here different amounts of time. And they range, I guess, from 40 year olds who've been working here for, went to high school, college and have been working here-35 year olds at least, maybe 40 olds-to people who came three months ago and are being put up at a not very pleasant room in a shelter in New York, and I don't know if they're even allowed to work. Anyway, shows I'm ignorant about this. So explain what's the internal situation with undocumented immigrants? Yeah. So right now, estimates are that there are about 13 to 15 million undocumented immigrants in the country. And despite the rhetoric around the undocumented population and the way the Trump campaign talked about it, most of these are people who have been here for a long time. There is a minority that arrived in the last four years."
UCDhem2OHvh,7850,Robert Kagan,"So when Trump comes in and wants to be tough on crime, he is hardly going to be swimming against the tide. And if you think about where he first wants to militarize our society, which he talks about a lot, and this is something that I think we learned from his first term, if you've read Miles Taylor or listened to him talk and others from the administration, is that the one thing that Trump discovered, as all presidents do, is that the one thing that he can do is order the military around 'cause he is commander-in-chief. So he talks about using the military to carry out deportations and man immigrant holding centers. And a majority of Americans are going to be probably fine with that, but the problem is, it's more than the camel's nose inside the tent when you start using the military for domestic purposes that it was not intended to be used for. He can use the Homeland Security as a domestic military force as well, but as long as he's doing these things on issues where there is, not just Republican and MAGA support, but sort of broader support on the general issue. Jamie Dimon said Trump was right about immigration. So that's the other scary thing, is that he can start sort of abusing his powers in a way that a lot of Americans will find acceptable."

Reminds me a little of Clinton, Gore '92, which you remember extremely well. There's a little downtime and then the convention, so talk us through what to look for, what advice you would give them over these next two, three weeks, which seemed pretty important to me. Politics, to be so trite, every journey begins with a step. We all know that. People really don't know who she is. We think we know her, but we really kinda don't. There's a Fox caricature of who she is, we know she's a California liberal, we know she's multi-ethnic or biracial, I don't know and I hate talking about that shit anyway, but we know all of that. What she has a chance to do, and she's got it pretty much front and center between now and the Thursday night at the convention, tell us more about you. Make us like you. We're open to it. We're on a date here and we like you going into it, and try not to pick your nose."
11654x7urpz,6873,A.B. Stoddard,"I am better for these reasons."" And I think he has to find a way to say that with strength. Yeah, I think that's right. For all that the Republican establishment is discredited allegedly and mixed blessing, I do think having a lot of these senators and governors just weigh in the way you just said would have some effect on those swing maybe Trump voters. Obviously, Trump will have his 30% no matter what, but it can't just be DeSantis saying it, but it can't not be DeSantis saying it. It has to be people up to and including probably Mitch McConnell ultimately, just people who really... If you're a business Republican and you respect, it has to be the chamber of commerce, it has to be whoever it is in different states saying, ""Look, we have a better alternative here. Trump's likely to lose. He's going to govern very erratically if he gets back in."" But that is a more traditional message for DeSantis, and what's weird is the DeSantis campaign seems to have seemed to have talked itself into, ""we can't be the establishment candidate at all. We have to be even more of a culture warrior than Trump."" They spend half their time, that super PAC of DeSantis's, they're accusing Trump of being like in cahoots with CNN, and I just think that's the most ineffective..."

_OMeRx6v1T1,2361,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It was also a rise in visa overstays. As flights became cheaper and the world became richer, getting to the United States on a visa became easier. And there was a point in the early 2010s when the number of visa overstays, where visa overstays were a larger contributor to the undocumented population than people crossing the border. That is no longer true, obviously, given what we've seen in the last few years. But if you look at that population, crucial to understand, a lot of people say things like, ""Well, why didn't they just apply for citizenship if they've been here for 30 years? Why haven't they gotten a Green Card?"" And the answer is that Congress has very deliberately made that almost impossible. So for the vast majority of the undocumented immigrant population, it doesn't matter how long they've been here, there is no way legally for them to get status without Congress changing the law. Congress doesn't want to reward them for jumping the line, so to speak. At least that's the argument, right? That people should wait to come here legally. That was sort of the- Maybe, but they can't wait legally at this point. That's the whole thing. There is literally no way for them to get a Green Card. And even if they were to go back to their home country, they would be barred from reentering for 10 years and would likely not be eligible for any form of status."

They barely held, and none of the people who helped hold them up are going to be there in the second term, Pence and Mattis and- Gary Cohn is not going to be there to move things around on your desk so you don't see it. Right. Or General Kelly's not going to be there to- Bringing that home is hard to voters, I think, that they saw him for four years. They think it wasn't that terrible. What's the problem? You got to really... that's why it has to be a forward- looking campaign. Someone was quoted the other day in the paper, ""If it's a referendum on Trump's presidency against Biden's presidency, that's not good for Biden."" Fairly or unfairly, but people retrospectively have sort of whitewashed their memories of the Trump presidency. There's one word that Biden needs to use more often: the recovery. By saying, ""The recovery,"" is enough. You remind people that we were down."
qEUZ9iP1-_Q,2903,Eric Edelman,"So you will keep a close eye on it, right? And we'll get back together to discuss when the billiard balls are really breaking or really not breaking or something. I don't know what the metaphor is. Do you find that personally? I mean, you've been involved for decades in this. Is it as worrisome? I don't mean to put words in your mouth. You tell me. How worrisome is the current moment? I co-chaired a commission on National Defense Strategy with former Representative Jane Harman of California, which reported last year and our report basically said, and it quoted former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates to this effect, that the country's actually facing probably the most challenging international security environment, certainly since the end of the Cold War, but probably since the end of World War II, with this sort of tightening collaboration among adversaries, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. It's not a time for improvisation, it's not a time for lack of coordination and foreign policy by whim. And unfortunately, I think that's what we have. So yes, I find the international environment very worrisome. We will be worried, but more importantly, we'll try to intelligently discuss it and do what we can, I suppose, to influence it. So Eric, thank you so much for sharing your genuine wisdom here with us today, and we'll have you back soon, obviously."
A2sfF5VcWJu,3823,Eric Edelman,"He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations, to reintegrate them into the Syrian Armed Forces, and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who, if left untended, could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria. So he asked for all of those very important things, but not for some of the things that even Senator Thune talked about when he was asked about this, which include rule of law and minority rights and domestic reform in Syria. And therein lies, I think, a contradiction at the heart of, again, of Trumpism. I mean, again, to the degree that there's a doctrinal side to this, Trump sort of announced it in his speech in Riyadh where he said, ""We're not going to tell these countries how to organize themselves and how to live their lives the way my stupid predecessors did by insisting on human rights and rule of law. We're not going to do that. We're going to deal with the governments as they are,"" and et cetera. The problem is, in Syria, you don't want an inverse of what you had under Assad, which was an Alawite dictatorship over a Sunni Arab majority."
Hjx_Cwx4Fca,3557,David Axelrod,"That said, I still weep when I see a starving Palestinian child, I still weep when I see families destroyed. And I think the passion of these young people... Some of it is misinformed, some of it is unfair, but a lot of it is them reacting to what they're seeing. I wonder if they're focused on what the difference would have been had Donald Trump been president at the time this happened, because he would have applied no restraint. He would not have been an advocate for restraint or for humanitarian aid. By the way, we should say a word about the seven World Kitchen Central folks who were killed in Gaza, apparently by Israeli forces accidentally, Prime Minister says. I take him at his word on that. But this is just a horrific situation. So that's a long way of saying one hopes this is at a different place come November, and that people rec- It's World's Central Kitchen. I got that wrong. One hopes that by November, there will be a different situation, that the war will be over, that some rebuilding will be done, that there'll be some discussion of what comes next that includes Palestinians in that discussion. But this is a real thing, and Biden's not getting the credit for what he has done."
8yb8w7fMxQo,3677,Doug Sosnik,"The economic policies of Trump favor the rich. Why are these idiots supporting him?"" Then I'd go to a Republican group and they would say, ""I don't understand these young college graduates-then name a color. The economic opportunities have never been greater for them since Trump became president. Why aren't they supporting Trump?"" And the answer for both groups is the same, which is that this is much more deep-seated about who you are as a person, what your values are. That does correlate to education but it's much deeper than that. And so as a result of that, if you believe that, it shows you why it's so difficult to get out of this relatively evenly divided country. So in our previous conversation you thought this will eventually break open. It's kind of not really sustainable, ultimately, and I very much agree with that. That's a 2028 or 2032 thing or something like that. I gotta say, part of me thinks... not most of me, most of me thinks we're going to have a polarized election that'll be very much as you described, either it'll look like 2016 or 2020 and that'll be the kind of range of outcomes in those six states. But a little bit of me thinks, I don't know, if two thirds of the country doesn't want these guys, and they're going to both clinch, let's assume, their party's nomination."
xfFgqYExdpS,16011,Anne Applebaum,"And yesterday I believe, he was being interviewed on election day, and he said something that to me was astonishing. He said, ""Germany needs to begin to think about becoming independent of the United States."" In other words, the most centrist, the most pro-American, the most pro-NATO piece of the German political spectrum now wonders whether the United States can be an ally anymore. And I think... I don't want to be overly dramatic. There many things are still going to happen and we don't know...Things can change. But the fact that an important German ally, like that one, says that on TV, and he even said something like, ""I can't believe I'm saying this on TV."" But that he says it means that there's been a real sea change in Germany. The other part of the story that probably many know, the German far-right party, the Alliance for Germany won about 20% of the vote. This is actually a little bit less than people thought they might win. They might well have been hurt by the intervention of Elon Musk. In the campaign, he promoted the AFD, he did a live interview with their leader on Twitter. JD Vance also made a subtler and even more insidious intervention in the campaign by denouncing Germany for not being sufficiently in favor of free speech at the Munich Security Conference a few days ago."
Hyh_wtkpHDF,8281,Robert Kagan,"And what's next, right? I mean, I feel like that was a big moment that got sort of slid over. I don't know. Yeah. I don't really know whether people didn't really believe that Jamie Dimon really meant any of the things that he said. I don't know. But the bottom line is, I didn't even take the substance of it very seriously, I read that as Jamie Dimon signaling to Donald Trump that ""You're not going to have any problem from me and my kind,"" which I think Donald Trump knows, which does get to this larger point, which is okay, I don't have any doubt that the American corporate world will be fine with Donald Trump as long as they bring him the necessary gifts or cut the deals with his family that he wants them to cut. I mean, they're going to be okay. Capitalism and authoritarianism may be incompatible ultimately, but capitalists and authoritarianism are not incompatible. As we've seen, there were rich people in China too, you know? But when you get beyond Jamie Dimon and start asking this question about what we used to call the normie Republicans, they also, in my view, I feel like this is where Lincoln and Jefferson's warnings come into play. I think they also think they'll be fine."
f44Uuvkx0rG,2448,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"They cannot suddenly add hundreds of new immigration judges overnight. The hiring process takes a long time, and Congress has never funded the immigration court anywhere near the level that would be necessary to do that. So they can't just sweep down to New York and say, ""There are a couple of thousand people shown up in New York in the last couple of years, and we're kicking them out."" Would it require a change in the law to do that? I mean, how protected are these people? Well, they're protected in that there is a legal process, and the legal process requires that the government obtain a formal removal order before anyone can be deported. And it's obtaining that formal removal order that is so backlogged right now. And so people who came into New York and are part of a process and are going through that removal process are effectively safe from Trump right now because they are already in a legal process, and Trump can't speed that up to completely, though last time around, he made a lot of efforts to turn the immigration courts into assembly lines for deportation. And we do expect that this will be a major regulatory agenda. Speed up the timelines for every hearing, limit the number of opportunities people have to find a lawyer, and delay the case so that they can get legal representation, force people to submit applications even more quickly or else see them automatically denied, that's the kind of thing he tried the first time around and will likely attempt to do the second time around."
SkSEonPj9b_,3824,Eric Edelman,"If it walks away and it continues to allow the military assistance that's in the pipeline from the Biden packages of assistance that were still in train, contracts that are still playing out and being delivered. If it means continued willingness to allow the Ukrainians to purchase US military equipment financed perhaps by the Europeans, either using the interest on Russian held debt as the Fins are doing with artillery shells for Ukraine, and if it means the continuation of very important US intelligence sharing with Ukraine, that's one thing. If it's what we saw briefly in the aftermath of the Oval meeting, the disastrous Oval meeting between Zelensky and Trump back in February of a cutoff of intelligence, a cutoff of assistance, and apparently also a cessation of offensive cyber operations against Russia that was ordered briefly by Secretary Hegseth, that's a completely different story, and that would truly be I think, a sellout of Ukraine and pretty catastrophic. I mean, the Ukrainians have shown really incredible valor under strain and willingness to fight with some limitations that I would rather them not have, but seem to be politically required for the moment. But if they're cut off from the intelligence and other US assistance, that would make it very tough for them to continue. So the whole Russia-Ukraine situation maybe comes to a head this summer because I think some of those weapons, they'll either have to be renewed or permitted or not, and the intelligence cooperation continues or not."
3mQMpIXzCy-,3551,Eric Edelman,"Similarly, the hostage deal for Etan Alexander, we can all be glad that the last living American hostage was brought out, but it was done without regard to the fact that there are still a lot of Israeli hostages, not to mention some dead Americans who are still being held by Hamas. But again, no coordination really with Israel. You've also seen a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis in Yemen that was limited to their attacking US naval vessels in the Red Sea, even as the Houthis both immediately before and after this agreement, were targeting Ben Gurion airport with missiles and drones. So- Let's take 60 seconds on the Houthis, just a little bit of a sidebar from Israel. I mean, they also were launching occasional missiles at Israel, but one forgets, I wouldn't forget, but I mean the ""Signal-gate"" thing that ended up helping to cost the National Security Advisor Mike Waltz his job, was about this US military operation against the Houthis, that's what Pete Hegseth disclosed that he shouldn't have, presumably. This was much hoopla, certainly among Trump supporters, ""He's tough, not like Biden. We're war fighters, we're bombing the hell out of them."" What was that all about? How did that all work out? Well, I mean, what's happened, look, there was an argument for a more robust policy than the Biden folks were willing to undertake against the Houthis who were in fact disrupting international shipping through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea."

And what it didn't hold here, I would say, and hasn't held everywhere... it's sort of held for now in Germany. But you're right to be of course, cautious. So give us the sense, I think you were at the Munich conference. And which was what, just two weeks ago. And you're right there in Warsaw. What is the sense in Germany, I don't know... What sense in Europe, how serious do they hope the US can come back onside? Do they really think they may have to fend for themselves? Do they think they can fend for themselves together or separately? So there has been a series of shocks. The Trump election itself, the Vance speech in Munich, which I'm sure you've discussed already on previous podcasts, which was understood by the people in the room as an insult. Never mind what the speech actually said. It was understood as an insult. Remember who's at the Munich Security Conference?"
Iho5t9v_m-o,8128,A.B. Stoddard,"But Trump is going to say, ""In a couple of months, sleepy Joe's going to be in the hospital, and we're going to be stuck with Kamala."" And that's crude, but that's what he'll say. And it will matter. And especially if he picks Nikki Haley, and he doesn't have someone crazy like Kari Lake as his VP. I don't know. That actually could matter. These two old guys, one clearly older, an unpopular vice-president, so that's a real factor that could be part of the conversation. So we know that he probably ran because he was afraid of the open primary that you and I have been advocating for a year and afraid that would open up divides in the party and that people would get upset that he wasn't openly endorsing her. But he can't openly endorse anybody because the voters pick the nominee. So it wouldn't have ever been appropriate for him to do that. But I feel that he was probably talked into running again because people were too afraid of those divides and of alienating Black women, the most critical constituency in the coalition. So that's likely what happened. It doesn't look good for their prospects. As the great James Carville said on Conversations with Bill Kristol , the age thing gets worse each week."

This is where I give Japan credit, I think Prime Minister Kishida a couple years ago announced that Japan would double its defense spending from 1% to 2%, and you think about a 1% increase for a country that's the fourth-largest economy in the world, that's a big increase. And plus, they made decisions to acquire counterstrike land attack cruise missiles, big change from where their constitutional foundations have been with regard to these matters. So you see some countries taking it very, very seriously, and you see others not so, and I think we all need to have that collective sense that we are in a new era, we're going to have to get back to higher levels of defense spending no matter if we would prefer otherwise. And America and a few countries just can't carry all this weight. The voters just will not suffer that, and I think we'll talk about that, you'll see Trump tapping into that notion as well. Yeah, they need to do more, but they can't really ultimately do it without us either. So it's a- That's right. We need both to..."
VXJBUL-XNYh,6992,Tom Tugendhat,"So this was a pretty universal view. In fact, so much so that you may remember President Biden offered a helicopter to go and get President Zelensky out. And he very famously responded, ""I don't need a lift, I need ammunition."" And thank God he did because his courage solidified the defense of Kyiv. And in solidifying the defense of Kyiv, he solidified the defense of the whole country. And he's been quite literally, personally, quite literally on the front line of freedom ever since. And so it's been quite remarkable. So I don't think it was a foregone conclusion at all. There are various reasons I'm sure would come to them as to why the Russians failed, partly their own fault, partly the courage to the Ukrainians and partly, thank God, people like Ben Wallace who's our defense secretary who got weapons into Ukraine when a lot of people were either saying, ""There's no point they'll be defeated so quickly they won't count."" Or, ""It can all wait, don't get involved."" And that's just people in our own system, let alone in other countries. And so it's been really quite something. And I think being with them this year, being in Ukraine this year, being in Kyiv this year was really quite moving as well, because of course it's been a long time since your independence day was marked by anything other than fireworks and celebrations."
ji7oMccCpcI,3337,Doug Sosnik,"Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined again today by Doug Sosnik, the veteran democratic strategist, political director in the Clinton White House from, I think six years of the Clinton presidency, 1994 to 2000. Advised on dozens of Democratic campaigns over the years, often very successfully. Really widely regarded and respected in Washington as not just a political strategist who knows the ins and outs of campaign tactics, but a real thinker about American politics, the two parties, where we've been, where we're going... People look forward to his monthly memos, which lay out some of his thinking on this. A very good piece in the New York Times earlier this week, we're speaking on what? The 14th of February on Biden and Trump. Anyway, we had a conversation about what, six, seven months ago, and that stands up well, too. So Doug, thanks for joining me again. Thanks, great to be here, Bill. Okay, so Doug, well let's just, maybe we'll talk about where we are in the election, Biden and Trump, and then a little bit more broadly since you're so good at that too, at the, not just where's the election, but where's the country and what things might happen that might surprise us, but where's the race?"
bv6KfnYQnGw,2928,Doug Sosnik,"Which is, despite all our problems, I'd rather have America with our problems, compared to any other country in the world by far. I mean, we have a lot of problems. But, my God, we have strengths which is largely built around our people, and at least up until now around a legal system that's independent. And also the entrepreneurial spirit that made America to what it is, is still the DNA of our country. So I'm quite optimistic if we can get to the other side, that we're going to be able to turn the corner and reach our potential again. But we are in this three- decade trough right now of going from one era to another, and getting new institutions that are responsive to people, what they care about, so that we can rebuild trust in our country and all of our institutions, but particularly our governmental and political goals. That's good. No, I'm going to think a lot about this somewhat hopeful vista and vision over the next eight months as I look at the actual candidates and choices we face, and debates and everything else, conventions we're going to have. But no, look, it's a very important point and a good point that you make. And it's not just for leaving people happy after one gives a speech, though I agree with that."
rzVhKpXr9Wr,6906,Tom Tugendhat,"I tell you my thoughts and prayers are with their soldiers. I hope very much that they achieve the ends that they need. But the reality is this is a hard slog, and... Although I think there's no great doubt the Russians have lost. And what we're now seeing is the pain of defeat for the Russian Armed Forces inside Ukraine. Sadly, that pain is shared and too many Ukrainians are being killed in the process as well. I have no doubt that the end result is clear. The courage and commitment of the Ukrainian people means that Ukraine will not and cannot be a Russian satellite or a Russian colony again. And now what we need to do is to make sure that the trauma of occupation is ended as soon as possible. And this counter offensive, it seems kind of impressive, both in its conception and, well, certainly it's a couple of days in, its execution, but it's unlikely you think it will result in a route of the Russians where somehow the situation is solved in six weeks. I mean, I'm not close enough to the frontline and close enough to the military elements to comment on it, I'm afraid. And you'll forgive me as a former professional soldier, I know how easy it is to get false impressions from TV reports or from reported gossip."
QaULgEKPmuV,3636,Eric Edelman,"Because the Turks were the major patrons and suppliers and protectors of HTS Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is the rebranded version of the Nusra Front that Farouk al-Sharaa heads and which liberated Syria from Assad. Turks have made no bones about the fact that they want to have some kind of, not just influence, but a defense agreement with Syria including potentially access to several air bases that have been vacated, which would be available. Some of those bases have been bombed by Israel during Israel's effort to completely denude Syria post-Assad of any military capability. And that's all understandable, I don't begrudge the Israelis that, but it's also opened up for the US the prospect potentially of two allies and partners clashing with one another. And in a more normal administration, I mean, I think you would've had a senior envoy out there already trying to work out some deconfliction. Instead, we've got a circumstance in which the Israelis and Turks who don't want to come to blows over Syria are actually trying to work out this deconfliction themselves with sponsorship of the Emiratis. It's really an example of what happens when the US vacates the region and creates a vacuum. And it's I think not a terribly comfortable situation and one which if I were an Israeli, I'd be very worried about."
WhMCRwOran6,8651,James Carville,"It doesn't matter who's in there. To a person that would all say she's very confident and asks very good questions and seems to be well briefed. I'm happy that she's like this. I'm not totally surprised. You think that there's reasonable hope that that lasts? They've done a good job, don't you think, of rolling her out? She hasn't done any interviews in these two weeks. I notice people are beginning to whine and complain about that. That seems to me to be the sense. What do you think about that? First of all, where is it written you have to do press interviews? It's nowhere. Secondly, she's accepted the debate that Trump has weaseled out of and said, ""I've got a good idea. Ask me the question at the debate."" It may be in her interest to do that. I was telling... Katie Couric has a podcast like this, I guess, and I was on there last week and I said, ""Maybe she could do a Sarah Palin thing, but maybe she shouldn't."" As you well know, these things are fraught with danger, but I am not impressed by the argument that she needs to sit down and be grilled for 50 minutes on Sunday morning TV. Don't think that's what we need, but I expect she might do a little bit more than people think."
CyjBG_kdtcY,2110,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"I think it's pretty easy to say you don't join the National Guard because you want to go around rounding up grandmas. And that is a major challenge for the United States if they go down that path of trying to co-opt the military for this. National Guard recruiting is already difficult. Military recruiting is down significantly. And I will note, military recruiting is in many ways the highest among immigrant communities. And there are very high numbers of people with Green Cards and others coming from immigrant backgrounds joining the military by comparison to people who've been here for a few generations. So, if they actually start using the military to go into immigrant communities, you could be ordering a National Guard troop to go arrest their own family member. I mean, I don't think that's a particularly likely scenario, but it's the kind of thing that would hurt the US I think a lot more than people are really thinking about. This is so interesting, I'm learning from this the constraints on their ability to do an awful lot very, very fast. They're just a lot of people and limited capacities and laws that are currently in place that maybe they'll try to change, but it's not obvious they can change radically, even constitutional protections at some point."
wPMybbOlWUz,3259,Doug Sosnik,"And secondly, it's just Trump himself personally. Actually, he's not out very much, by the way. The very little secret is he's got his own 2020 basement strategy. Again, the tectonic plates were so strong that the traditional, you go in 99 counties and campaign in Iowa, DeSantis did that, and didn't carry a single county. Trump barely went to Iowa and Trump barely campaigned in New Hampshire. But when he is out there is an erratic nature to his performance. And so I think we'll have to see that. And then lastly, in the case of Biden, I think a lot of it's going to have to do with how he manages or isn't able to manage the issue. And he's going to have the pressures of at 81 years old, of not only running a country but running a campaign. And so you'll see a lot of that played out through proxy things like debates. When you have debates and Trump wants debates, he wants to engage Biden as much as possible in spontaneous events. And you can see the Biden White House is very concerned to put him out in non-controlled environments. They didn't do the Super Bowl interview. So I think a lot of it for Biden, I can tell you stories you want about the Reagan White House, but I think for Biden, a lot of it is going to be just turn the sound off and watch him on TV and see how he looks."
AI-IYGSaQLW,9056,James Carville,"If you look at the historic chart of the value to minimum wage, you can see. And so, not only you're going to raise somebody making $7.50 an hour, somebody who's making $12 an hour, their salaries will go up appropriately. Now you say, ""Well, it's going to [inaudible],"" but we do know that every dollar a low wage worker makes gets put back into the economy. A dollar you give to a high wage person, they put a fourth in the economy, a half in savings, and a fourth to pay taxes or something. They don't have that savings part; they're net borrowers. So, that's really hurting him in the economy and it's hurting him with young voters. I guess two questions to follow up on that. It sounds to me like you think the inflation slash economic wellbeing, especially of younger and less well-off people, remains the crucial issue he's got to address A, and B, I'm struck when you talk about these things, you're very clear and they sound they could be attractive politically, am I wrong to say that the Biden campaign, I feel like he gives some good speeches and he has some good policies, but they're not sustained somehow? I feel like everything is a one-off and there's no theme or narrative. Is that a little unfair or is that just the way the world is today with social media and stuff?"
8ROHsuRl6S1,8364,AB Stoddard,"He wants people to go into red areas. He worked construction, he served in the military. He knows what it's like to struggle to find healthcare coverage, to get a job where that would be provided. He basically, he says, you can't go to Walmart and buy a Carhartt jacket, a Carhartt boots, and show up at an event and try to talk to working class people and win them back from Trump. You have to be authentic. I've seen him repeat this message. I mean, this is somebody who's making an effort not only to get the message across to Democrats, but to become a voice for the Democrats. And so I think that kind of thing will spread. People have to take chances and they have to get out there. And Jasmine Crockett went viral on the oversight committee before Trump was reelected. So now she's running around trying to be a voice, and she made a mistake recently. So people are getting worried about that. People are worried also about having AOC and Bernie before facing because they're too liberal. That's all fine. But I think if you get out there and you carpet bomb in the face of the assault on our system that we're facing, something will stick. And that's why I think the idea of having some kind of rotating voices on a unified message, like my whiteboard idea is that you can get a mother who is affected in a measles outbreak one week and the next a senator."
c2JfZVqnIMD,7915,James Carville,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations. I'm very pleased to be joined again by my friend James Carville. We last had one of these conversations, I think right after Memorial Day. Joe Biden was the likely Democratic nominee, he was trailing Donald Trump. We were a little down on the dumps, I would say, even though we concealed it very well, of course. James is always cheerful, but I think we were slightly pessimistic about things. It's a different world now, I guess, or is it? Where do we stand? Where's the race really stand now, and what should we be looking for? First of all, thank you for having me on. Secondly, yes, it is decidedly better. It's not overwhelming, it wasn't a huge shift, but we're probably down two or three and we probably up two or three. In this environment, that's a lot. I don't know how much you can move, but we're testing and I think we'll test the upward number here in the next couple of weeks, at least I hope we do. But yes, everything is better. The polls better, fundraising is better, the enthusiasm is better. It's just unreasonable to even think it's not better. Now, how much it is, I see some of these giddy people on TV and like hey, knock it off."
e8tFAgwmyvQ,7319,Robert Kagan,"And incidentally you mentioned the anti-Semitism thing, made me think of it. We didn't let Jews... I mean think of that, everyone knew what was happening in Germany by '37, '38 certainly after Kristallnacht, right? Right. And we were so wedded threat to our nativist restrictionism in immigration we wouldn't let Jews in from Germany or certainly from Europe. Argentina let, my sense is, people in more easily, or Cuba, all kinds of places like that, not paragons of liberalism one might not have said. So I think the real world effects of some of these things is also somehow a little bit washed over, or glossed over in some of the histories. Right, and then the 1965 immigration reform, which then permitted not only much more immigration, but a wave of non-white immigration that was also unprecedented in American history. You had huge influx of Asians, people from Latin America, and other non-European sources of immigration, which also further changed the complexion of the country, but which has led obviously to the same kind of backlash that we saw in the 1920s, which was a reaction to the previous immigration flow. And now we are seeing this reaction to the immigration flow that began in 1965. The interesting thing is that, and as I try to argue in the book, the problem for the anti-liberals and the white nationalists and the white Christian nationalists is that they closed the door way too late."
197arSooszQ,2727,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And of course, being undocumented itself is not a crime. It is a civil violation of immigration law, the punishment for which is deportation. You can't be thrown in jail for being undocumented. You are not committing a crime every single day you are living here. You are just here in violation of immigration law, and if caught, can be ordered deported. And Trump says all of them have to go, and that is a big concern, again, because we're talking about 4% of the US population in total. In some states, 1 in every 20 people. And the ones who registered with DACA, they're no better off than the ones who never registered with anyone? Well, they're significantly better off because they have protections from deportations in the ability to work legally. So as of today, there's a little bit more than 530,000 people who still have DACA. No one has been able to apply for new DACA for years, thanks to the first Trump administration. And mostly, at this point, people are aging out of ever having been eligible for DACA in the first place. What does DACA says? Even I don't remember now. So DACA is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and was for any person who entered the United States before June 2007. And so, at this point, there are not very many people who are eligible for DACA, even if applications were to reopen, because anyone who entered after that point is not eligible for the program."
REk8R85AKCg,2453,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And they did this during the first term too. For example, there was a population of several thousand Indonesian Christians who had come to the United States in the 2000s after the earthquake. And for various reasons, there were some agreements between the Bush administration and senators at the time of the States where those people were living not to deport them back to Indonesia as they argued that they were going to be persecuted where they came from in a Muslim-majority part of Indonesia. And ICE said, ""Okay, sure, fine, we won't deport you."" And they were checking in with ICE every single year for 15 years. And then Trump came into office in 2017 and said, ""Deal's over, we're going to kick you out right now,"" and started deporting some of those people. So, there is a population of people that they can go after much more easily. That said, that's a fairly small, all things considered and is not how they're ever going to get anywhere near 11 million. So, say a word about in practice... two questions, I guess, I have. We read recently about something in California, they went after some farm workers, and it seemed like a bit of a mini-raid there as a test maybe of how this might work. And there were rumors about a symbolic raid very early in, maybe in the first week of the Trump administration, in some place like DC or New York, that's a... blue states or sanctuary city-type situation, so they can make the point."
l9RXKTAv6wp,3501,David Axelrod,"But a good campaign could make it harder for him to straddle it and duck it. Partly because of DeSantis, he attacked the six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed, that Supreme Court in Florida affirmed yesterday that is going to have reverberations nationally. This issue is going to be a real problem for Trump, and he's going to have a hard time navigating it from now until election day. God, there's so much we could talk about and this is also interesting. I just went through a bunch of things. The Haley, Chris Christie, Liz Cheney sort of supporters out there, whatever number of Republicans and semi-Republicans there are. I mean, the Haley voters are the most concrete example. There were hundreds of thousands of them in battleground states, more than the margin in Michigan and Georgia, and I guess North Carolina, too. Anything special about getting some of those voters [inaudible] for Biden. Some of them are just Republicans, but there are some of them in the middle. I prefer to call them Bill Kristol Republicans. There you go. Yeah. They're already for Biden, the Bill Kristol Republicans. These Haley voters are undecided. Yeah, they are, but what were the centerpieces of her campaign? They had to do with national security issues, and that's a place where Biden should press his advantage."
Lwd1eT2nq5Q,5690,Aaron Friedberg,"So the claim that someone is risky because they're threatening to make radical changes in policy may not work if people don't believe in the threat and therefore don't see the danger of having someone who might do that. I think that's a real failure on the part of our leadership up to this point. I was just looking at the Commission on National Defense Strategy that came out over the summer, and normal people don't read those things and they certainly don't read them every time they come out, but if you do read them, it's quite hair-raising. And these are serious sober people from both political parties who are saying, I think in the first sentence, we face the most dangerous international environment since the end of the second World War. Therefore, we need to increase defense spending considerably. We need to make serious changes in strategy and all the things that follow from that. I don't think that most people in this country see the world in that way. And part of the reason is that I don't think our leaders have successfully conveyed that message and that heightens the danger I think. Because, well, just taking the defense spending as an example, we're headed towards 3% of GDP, far lower than the average over the course of the Cold War."
XPQZAgB6__A,6232,Aaron Friedberg,"He doesn't speak that language, and I don't think he's going to pursue the kinds of policies that will make that possible over a period of time. So he's risky, but maybe there's something about the way people are viewing the world, which doesn't make it clear just how risky he is. No, that's really well said. Our friend Eric Edelman was Vice Chairman of the Commission and really co-author of that report and has testified on it before Congress. And I think I need to go read the whole... Really read it. I've just looked at the kind of headlines of it and maybe have a conversation with Eric, I guess about it at some point in the future. But the paradox, I guess is in a political way for Harris thinking about the next five weeks is a version of what follows what you've said, which is, I mean, any incumbent administration sort of wants to portray things as getting better. I'd say the Biden administration in particular though is not... They've done some, might be pretty good things. You think on China and I think on Ukraine, we both think on Ukraine and so forth, actually supporting Israel, but they certainly haven't made one of their centerpieces of their rhetoric that it's a very dangerous world out there and we need to do more than we've been doing."
59RhWpkZK1v,7930,Robert Kagan,"And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that. And one of the things, that's why, in a way, that's what I'm trying to do in this book, is to say, ""Wait a second, we know what this movement is. We've seen this movement again and again and again throughout history."" And that's the part of it that I think people have lost sight of. We're so presentist in our approach to things. We only remember the last 20 years, if that. And we don't realize that the movement we're looking at today has been visible in every generation of Americans since the founding. And that's what I'm trying to get at, because we really have been having this argument from the very beginning, and we're still having it. Let's talk maybe then about the decade that I found most fascinating that you discussed at different times in your book. It also is important in the previous, in the history of American foreign policy book, which is the 1920s."
28fjSu8vnCE,7417,Robert Kagan,"To some extent, it's now happening among a certain number of minority groups who have hitherto been discriminated against, and now, almost by definition, they must feel comfortable enough that they don't feel the need for liberalism to protect them anymore. So they now have the luxury, I suppose, of voting for Donald Trump on whatever other grounds, and could be, as you say, they got over the bridge and now let's pull up the bridge because they don't want anybody else coming in. And that's a real problem. Again, a lot of it will depend on how much even political leaders are willing to defend liberalism. And I think that there's no question that liberalism has been attacked from both sides, from left and from right, and the constituency for liberalism in America, this sort of passionate constituency for liberalism in America. Again, I want to emphasize I'm talking about the founders' liberalism, seems to be severely diminished on numerous fronts, and I don't know whether we can recapture it. I don't want World War II, but it was World War II in a way that reinvigorated ... It was a liberal war, and it therefore reinvigorated liberalism. And I suppose these groups don't have to have a fervor necessarily for anti-liberalism. I mean, in a way, one point you make is, anti-liberalism in a way is a default position or can become a default position."
8d77rKoY21a,7894,James Carville,"They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough. And Haley gets 22% in a closed Republican primary in a place like Indiana and Nebraska, it's a lot of people. And that 22% is going to have terribly hard time voting for a Democrat, and the most likely scenario for most of them is they will return to their traditional partisan habits. But a conviction could stop that. So I think it can have an impact. It's not going to be a moment where somebody in South Mississippi comes up to me at the Walmart and says, ""James, God, I was so wrong all of my life and thank God I saw the light."" No, that's not going to happen. But you could get some what I call loosely aligned voters, and there may be some loosely aligned Democrats that think the economy was better under Trump and just may stop some bleeding on that end too. Yeah, that sounds right to me. It seems to me though that, I mean the Biden campaign to come back to the campaign for a minute, or even the outside groups, they have a tendency to think, okay, well the guilty thing will explain itself."
IW4-p6f2zFw,5946,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't see that in the offing. As you say, and maybe we come back to this, there are those two branches, question of whether the U.S. and others would assist the Ukrainians in escalating in some way that might have hope of bringing about a more successful outcome. Or, whether we might under, for example, a Trump Administration, put pressure on Ukraine to come to terms with the Russians, even as things stand now, giving up a chunk of their territory, effectively. Yeah. And the other point people don't, I think, make quite often enough about this situation, Anne Applebaum's made this point in conversations here, and some others have. But if you have a more conventional border war, you can have a stalemate, and you can have a negotiated temporary settlements, at least. If you have a semi-genocidal war against the country you're conquering, and trying to kidnap its children, and kill and torture people, and so forth, it's a little hard to know what even a stalemate or agreement on territory would mean. Are they really going to just allow Russia to just destroy and devastate millions of Ukrainians? So the nature of the war, I think, makes it harder to get to. Yes, and I think, also, the nature of the technologies involved, the fact that you have these long range standoff weapons on both sides, so even if you had a stabilized front on the ground, you could continue to have strikes on infrastructure and military targets going back and forth in both directions."
8hryKqwo-EI,2252,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"The latter thing, people trying to sneak through without being caught is really what the border looked like for most of US history or the last century, really, since we invented the concept of undocumented immigrants by imposing restrictions on immigration. But what we haven't really seen in the past and what has been going on in the past decade is very large numbers of people crossing and immediately availing themselves of the nearest law enforcement officer and not trying to hide, walking across and turning themselves in immediately. That latter behavior does seem to be more heavily impacted by policy. And why did people do that? Asylum is a good thing to have, or it's easier to get than it used to be? Or just... Well, it's not clear why this started. Of course, since 1980, immigration law has allowed any person crossing the border by whatever means to access the asylum process. One major change in the 1980s, after this law was passed, the Refugee Act of 1980, the Reagan administration largely ignored that and turned people away rapidly anyway, including people fleeing the death squads in El Salvador or the indigenous genocide in Guatemala in the 1980s, were turned away at a rate of 97 to 98% of asylum seekers. The big shift really began under the Obama administration as more people began leaving El Salvador and Honduras, as MS-13 became ascendant in those countries and started recruiting young children for their gangs and taking women forcefully as ""girlfriends"" with no choice."
JocXIU1zLsc,5806,Tim Snyder,"It's not just doing the right thing and helping a country that's dealing with a terrible neighbor. It's actually a huge strategic advantage. I don't know if maybe that's just our wars over the last, God knows, 50 years Vietnam and Iraq and Afghani- we're helping people who I think we could argue were on the better side of these conflicts against dictators and so forth. But it was more us trying to do the right thing and help them. And as she put it, well, as I mentioned Vietnam, she said people need to think of Ukraine as West Germany, not as Vietnam. That's not quite right. But I mean, as a big country, that will be a very important ally in fighting for freedom and democracy in the future, not simply as a place we kind of have intervened to try to help do the right thing. Yeah, I mean, this is the problem is that we don't actually have an analogy, and I mean there are two differences, but with Iraq, and these are places where you and I may disagree, but in Iraq, we actually intervened militarily, which we didn't do in Ukraine, we're not going to do. And what we did, we did on false pretenses. And so that's meant that we lost a lot of credibility with our own people and then also with others."
FWhV_r7QLo3,7858,Robert Kagan,"A week. Anything surprising in the reaction? People more hostile, less hostile, more open? I don't know, surprised, not surprised? Well, I think I've been on pretty friendly media so far, so it's hard to... If you're on MSNBC a lot, I'm not going to get attacked from where I think... I had an interesting conversation with Jonah Goldberg on his podcast. I'm expecting that, well, people may just ignore it, but if they don't ignore it, I expect conservatives to sort of push back on my pretty negative treatment of modern conservatism. And that's something we didn't really get into, but even people who are anti-Trump are sort of like, ""Why are you saying that about Bill Buckley? Why are you condemning originalism,"" which I say is an anti-liberal doctrine almost inherently. So there may be some of that coming up. But people are open to this notion that, they're open to getting out of the progressive mindset that liberalism is still on the right side of history kind of thing. The arc of, what is it, the arc of history bends towards justice or liberalism or something? Right. I don't know. The problem is, even for Democrats, of course, it's very easy for them to fall into the yeah, well, this has been... It's just like Ronald Reagan."
Xst522g_DaP,5896,Jack Goldsmith,"I'm not saying that reform is not a good idea and that certainly looking at reform isn't. And it's just a question of how they go about it and whether they're going to... This is another important point, so much of effective government is not just about the exercise of hard executive power to coerce people into doing things. There's just only so far that can get you. I don't care how broad a view of the unitary executive the president has, there's always an element of cooperation, persuasion, leadership, et cetera, and the people who can really bring reforms are the people that have that full range of qualities. So I think it's an open question. It's also an open question whether when these people get in these jobs, they're really going to be wrecking balls because they're soon going to discover that if they're really wrecking balls, it's not going to be in their interest, at least that's what I think we'll see. I mean, of course national security could suffer if the agencies become dysfunctional, but it's just not clear to me that the wrecking ball approach is the optimal approach for bringing the reform they want. Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. So last topic. I'll let you go in a minute. I mean, Congress, so we barely mentioned it, which probably itself tells us something about some decline of Congressional oversight, and competence, and supervision of all these things, or maybe not."
ulfioNGs0-j,3306,David Axelrod,"I would expect both the Biden campaign and the Biden super PAC or super PACs to be very active in the spring and really push some of these comparative arguments and try and knock Trump down a few points. I think this is the time. I don't think you want to wait to do that in the fall. I think intuitively people think that to talk to people when they're paying attention. Yes, you've got to do some of that, but this is a time when you can cement a negative narrative when they don't have the air power to respond. I mean take advantage of the fact that Trump has resource issues right now and press your advantage. That's very interesting. It's three months until July 4th. That's been my instinct. I mean if Biden could pick up two, three, four points and be a bit ahead by July 4th, that's a very different world than if he's had this little bump, but it subsides and Trump is plus two, three, four on July 4th don't you think? I just feel like- We also, Bill, have no idea what all these cases, I mean he's going to be tried in New York. That seems pretty clear. We're waiting on a Supreme Court decision and we could get a trial later in the year in Washington on the January 6th case."
BBawMpuhXhe,9028,Mark Esper,"At least in the military, you have a professional military class who understands what its ethics are, what the norms are, the proper behavior between civilians and the military, and I think they will hold the line. But the civilian Secretary of Defense has a lot of power. I've tried to emphasize this multiple times. There's only two people in the United States of America that can deploy United States forces, the President and the Secretary of Defense, not the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not the Vice President, it's only the President and the Secretary of Defense. So it's an immensely powerful position, and there's other things that come with that responsibility too. So these decisions on personnel will be very, very important. And that should concern us, again. Yeah. And I think you were alarmed, as I was, when you were relieved and the kinds of people that President Trump wanted to bring in there, and some of who he did bring in, maybe there was enough pushback that he couldn't quite do what he wanted to do. But you signed that letter on the very beginning of January of 2021, reminding, I guess all living former Secretaries of Defense did, reminding everyone that the military could not be used for political ends and so forth."
4BkOTHEWUBy,6930,AB Stoddard,"Well, yeah, we'll get to Democrats afterwards. I see sort of the population and then the institutions of law, of acting, yeah. That's a good distinction... And they're different. I feel that we've seen with the law firms always and others, a lot of hands in the air saying, we're trying to protect our business. We had no choice. You've mentioned this in recent conversations. I mean, what am I going to do? Always the back against the wall. And then there's been preemptive cowering because of these other examples like, well, that'll be me next, and I have shareholders, or I have a board or whatever, and I gotta pay my employees, and so I have to survive. It is really difficult, in terms of watching the authoritarian model, to watch people capitulate so soon because the sooner they do, the more we'll see. The longer we might not be able to stop Trump's destruction of institutions, he's going to do what he can to deplete trust in them, but the sooner he cripples them, the harder it'll be for other outliers to try to stand up. You have to hang together as long as you can and then break, not break first. And so that's really... it's very powerful, their inability to unite, refusal to plan for this."
EH0-BCy2HJx,7401,Invisible Rulers,"But Mike Shellenberger wrote it in his newsletter, and then Mike Benz said it on Joe Rogan. And this is audiences of millions of people, and they write very carefully, but they say the thing, and know their audiences trust them and are not going to believe the correction. And they're not going to believe... They're never going to walk it back. But that's the sort of divide that we live in at this point. There's no evidence offered beyond the theory, but that's where we've kind of gotten to. Well, or some sort of fake evidence of some, as you say, misread spreadsheet. Or they like actually evidence in the wrong way. Right? Conspiracy theories always like... Joe McCarthy waved around the lists. I mean, they like to have a datum, I guess, that's not real or that's one exaggerated, or totally made up point. But they always want to have... It's funny how they- RENÉE DIRESTA: That is true. Usually, there's a screenshot. There is a- Yes, there's a thing. RENÉE DIRESTA: This is what happened... In the conspiracy theories about us, they actually... So when I was at Stanford Internet Observatory, the same people I just mentioned, Shellenberger and Benz, came up with this theory that we had censored 22 million Tweets. And the evidence of that was in a report that we wrote."
42zhGi-crFn,3649,David Axelrod,"And you talk about that, his inaction on pharmaceutical prices, a whole range of issues on which, on economics, he's just in the wrong place. And if there is a presumption that goes to Joe Biden for having some sense of the way real people, or average people, live... I think Trump gets a lot of points for cultural signification with working class people, but on economics, I think you can hammer him. And I think you have to remind people, get them to think about the future, about do they want someone who's going to take on the pharmaceutical companies? Do they want someone who's going to take on predatory interests, who raise costs? Do they want someone who's going to fight for healthcare rather than dismantle the Affordable Care Act? I think there are places where Trump is very vulnerable, and people aren't as focused on it as they can be. Yeah, the cultural stuff is so appalling. Certainly, people like me and you, I think, and many others, and certainly in Biden's circles and President Biden himself, I'm sure, the bigotry, the nativism, the mean-spiritedness, the demonizing of opponents, the total disregard for the rule of law, that one does tend to focus on that, whereas the populist economic argument might actually be more effective, as you say, this- I fundamentally believe that. ...is the problem with these modern campaigns."
NQPFYY5MJrm,7059,AB Stoddard,"It's an unbelievably tiny amount of money, and if it keeps his voters happy and they can go get their benefits fixed, and if something goes wrong by going to some office, well, that's a pretty small price to pay. So the rule of law side I'm curious about, and then the kind of eviscerating-of- government side. Trump has been very clear since he came on the stage in 2015 that he is a transactional guy, very interested in a deep safety net. He didn't want to take anybody's benefits away from them, be it Medicare, social security. He was the anti-Paul Ryan/Mitt Romney ticket. He basically... we're going to have a debt bomb, but he figures he'll be gone, and he's called himself the king of debt. He doesn't care about any of this. So it is very interesting that there is now kind of this resurgence of just a few-maybe three of them-republicans in Congress who have relocated their fiscal rectitude and feel that we need to be told about how just unsustainable this is, that we borrow money from other people and we can't go on like this, subsidizing businesses on and on. That's why we have to have tariffs, whatever. I don't believe in the end that Trump is on board for enacting deep Medicaid cuts and really eviscerating social security, but I believe that he believes that Elon is very helpful to him."
BSnL_M6oVlU,6338,AB Stoddard,"Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I'm Bill Kristol. Very pleased to be joined today-I think this is our third conversation together-by AB Stoddard, a veteran correspondent and analyst of Congress, I suppose primarily maybe, but really all things Washington and all things political and a observer of Trump from the beginning and not a fan of Trump from the beginning. I think it's very fair to say, AB, but also very much on the mark. I think really so much of what you wrote and said over these last several years has stood up so well and being... understanding the radicalism of what a Trump second term would look like. But I don't want to put words in your mouth so you can tell us about that. But first, welcome back, AB. It's great to be with you, Bill. Thank you. You were alarmed. You thought the second term would be different from the first term. We discussed this ourselves. I remember talking to you right after election day, but what are we now in since election day? It's been November, December, January, February, March, five months. What strikes you, what surprised you? Well, when I was on Fox News panels in 2015 and 2016 and we were talking about the rise of Trump first, of course it wasn't taken seriously and our late great friend, Charles Krauthammer, I believe, called him a rodeo clown."
u9d51dQf0Rh,3423,David Axelrod,"I mean, elections when your message is right is about the future, and my argument would be Biden's fighting for you and your future. Trump is consumed by his past and fighting for himself, and I would sort of build the campaign around that. We live in a very unsettled time, and that has made Biden's task harder. I think we have a post-pandemic PTSD. You can see the wrong track number that we always talk about in politics has remained pretty negative, people's view of the world. I think that's amplified by and fueled in many ways by social media, which thrives on the negative. What I wouldn't do, and I just was fulminating about this on my own podcast, on the Hacks on Tap podcast, I wouldn't go out there and extol the miracle of the Biden economy. It just drives me crazy when he does that. He was on the Today Show yesterday and he got asked by Al Roker about a very simple question. It was at the Easter egg hunt, and Roker asked, ""A lot of people are worried that their bucks aren't going as far. What do you tell them?"" Instead of sort of doing what you'd expect Joe Biden to do, because he's a person of empathy who grew up in a working class circumstance and identify with the concern, he said, ""I would tell him we've got the strongest economy in the world."" He continues to do that."
k2BNDwSGHZi,5770,Tim Snyder,"I mean, that's why the Russian propagandists have trouble containing themselves, is that the stuff that we're going to... It's this. The stuff that we're going to throw away would be enough to help the Ukrainian army defeat the Russian army. But we can't get ourselves together politically enough to give the Ukrainians the stuff we were going to throw away. And that's why they laugh at us. And I mean, that may be unpleasant, but we have to break out of it. Sometimes you have to... Other people can help you to see ourselves. And so yeah, the US should be able to help Ukraine win this war. I mean, now switching from the Russian point of view to ours, I guess the main thing that... The main switch I wish we could make is I wish we could say, ""Wow. In the last two years, the Ukrainians have done a lot for us."" They've defended the international order. The basic principle of international order is that countries shouldn't be invading other countries and changing territory. They have held off, in large measure, a genocide. Wherever the Russians occupy, they have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people. Holding off a genocide is not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world."
7aqRV8Bo1WT,3069,Doug Sosnik,"So we'll have to see if Biden's numbers will go down even further. My hunch is because we're in a divided country politically, Trump is still, despite his advantages, he's still at the upper end of his ceiling of around 46 or 47%. He never once had a 50% job approval one time as president. So I think he's pretty much at his high end, and I think Biden is probably at the low end of the range, but he really does need to pick up to get to at least the low to mid-forties if he's going to win. That's terrific that somebody thinks to follow up on there, a very helpful overview. So let me just pick up on a couple of different things. I was struck by the one poll answer-question and answer-you mentioned from I guess late October on, whose presidency did you prefer it as retrospectively Trump or Biden currently? I do think that's kind of undue, well, you couldn't ask that question of course at any time in the last hundred years, right? Since we haven't had an ex-president running against the current president and the most recent ex-president. So it is a weird race, a little different from the normal challenger-incumbent dynamics I think. I think we discussed this in June perhaps, where that people learn more about the challenger, it helps them if they like the challenger, it hurts them if they don't like the challenger, it hurts the challenger if people don't like him, if they see more of him."
gP3sWDu7s2b,3630,Doug Sosnik,"Since we haven't had an ex-president running against the current president and the most recent ex-president. So it is a weird race, a little different from the normal challenger-incumbent dynamics I think. I think we discussed this in June perhaps, where that people learn more about the challenger, it helps them if they like the challenger, it hurts them if they don't like the challenger, it hurts the challenger if people don't like him, if they see more of him. Here everyone has seen Trump for four years as president and Biden for three plus years as president. And I just feel like that's a pretty fundamental number, isn't it? If people think, ""the Trump presidency was better for me than the Biden presidency""... I mean, I just was struck by that. I'd love your comments on that. I mean, because people are still talking about the races if it's your standard incumbent versus- I'm sorry, challenger versus incumbent. It doesn't quite feel that way though. Well, you're right about that. I think there are probably three reasons for that. The first is that people remember their economic situation in 2019 before Covid was in a much better position than it is now. And remember that we've gone through the biggest, highest rate of inflation in our country since the early 1980s."
uovK05hFHfB,7975,AB Stoddard,"She's an outlier, obviously. I was really disappointed in their whole reaction to this national security breach, we'll call it, because they invited a civilian journalist into an insecure chat about war plans. And this ""Signal gate"" is just a little more than a week old, and Republicans looked the other way. Mike Turner, who's the intel chair on the house side, brought himself only to a TV studio to say, I guess this was courageous of him, that that information clearly would've been classified. But then he just said the way it was handled was so ""surprising."" He was deposed as house intel chair by Trump, basically at Trump's direction. Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Sorry. He wasn't, no, no, but I'm saying you're Former. Yeah, But that makes it even more astonishing. What does he owe Trump? I mean, he literally lost the job he cared the most about on The Hill. And that's what's kind of astonishing. I guess we'll close with this, just maybe do you think, I don't know, by September 30th, with all the drama with the budgets and Ukraine and NATO, there'll be a NATO summit. God knows what Trump will do there. Maybe we will begin to see-God knows you and I have spent eight years being disappointed to say the least by Republicans-but maybe at some point they snap a little bit, or as you said, maybe not even quite the ones who face primaries don't, but then there are others and maybe some candidates emerge somewhere who aren't simply, but maybe not, incidentally, the greed with which the whole party... to me it's just now whole generations of politicians who've made their way by being slavish imitators of Trump and lackies to Trump is, I guess we can't discount that."
AckEfHPCuz_,6826,Jack Goldsmith,"He was, of course, ready to appeal. He had plenty of attorneys to do that. I feel like doing it in the middle like that is more egregious in a way than doing a favor for someone that you respect or to be fair to someone you think was a good civil servant, a good public servant who deserves to, in a sense, have a break retrospectively. Yeah, I agree with all those distinctions. I mean... I agree with all those distinctions. We could still debate the late Bush pardons. I actually think they were justified because I think the independent counsel there had overreached, but you're right. They came after guilty pleas. They came after trials. The Biden one was in the middle. President Biden claimed that, and I can't assess this, that his son... No one else for these crimes would've been prosecuted, but the idea that his justice department was engaged in misbehavior is ridiculous. I don't know if you noticed this, but when Hunter Biden sought to have the case dismissed, the judge took issue with the president's description of the unfairness of the trial process and the prosecution in pretty strong and effective terms. The closest analogy, I think, to the Hunter Biden pardon is Ford's pardon of Nixon, where he basically pardoned him for a long period of time for crimes that he'd not yet been charged with."
x1u8UakL9QW,7581,Robert Kagan,"And then as God knows, there's a lot of ethnic violence and so forth. I mean, this is a staple of the American fiction, I like to read the mystery of old crime novels and stuff, cops are not neutral players among all the citizens in small town America or in big city America. Right? Right. Many famous books and novel and movies have been based on this. It is interesting, I don't know, these books and movies are very popular, and everyone sort of reads them and likes them I guess, but you don't really think, well, that's really kind of about America, this small-town violence. Yeah. The point I was trying to get to, which I didn't quite get to, which is that it doesn't require much change at the federal level to open up the opportunity to go back to what was a very common quality in America, which was the sort of the tolerated violence against certain groups. At the state and local level, often you could pretend it wasn't a national issue almost, right? We can't really control what happens. Yeah. Well, and that was the view, don't tell the south what to do. They have to deal with their world, their way, et cetera, et cetera. That's what Buckley was arguing in the '50s and '60s."
h7GMWFluo2O,17257,Anne Applebaum,"So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that. And I can't account for how that morale will eventually affect them. But the war continues not very much changed. And the Russians are not making a breakthrough and they've not achieved a victory. And so I think that's the first thing to say. I mean, I think the second thing to say is that, looked at from the point of view of the Ukrainians and indeed from the Poles and from Europe, all the events of the last couple of weeks that seemed so dramatic, the meeting of Trump and Putin in Alaska, the Europeans flying to Washington to meet Trump together with President Zelensky of Ukraine, all of it has had very little impact on the ground. And probably what it's doing is prolonging the war. So again, I have to be very careful how I say this because I too want these talks to succeed and I also want there to be a breakthrough. And I hope there are secret negotiations that I don't know about where something better is happening. But what we see from the outside, and indeed what the Europeans and the Ukrainians see, is simply President Putin stringing along Donald Trump."
U_LrHHtTNQ-,8449,Mark Esper,"But you signed that letter on the very beginning of January of 2021, reminding, I guess all living former Secretaries of Defense did, reminding everyone that the military could not be used for political ends and so forth. Talk a little bit about that. I was very struck by that. I thought, man, if Mark Esper and Dick Cheney and people like that, or Bob Gates are signing a letter like this, they're alarmed. And if they're alarmed, I'm alarmed. It's not the kind of thing you just do easily. Yeah, no, I think it was January 4th that we wrote that piece. We agreed on it. I had a hand in editing it and writing it. And it was remarkable that you had all of us sign on, the eight or nine at the time, probably the first time ever all living Secretaries of Defense, from both parties, by the way. So it was myself and Bill Cohen and Bob Gates and Leon Panetta. I mean, it ran the whole gamut, Republicans, Democrats and Republicans who work for Democrats. But I think one thing we all share is we know that there's a responsibility that comes with being Secretary of Defense and for running the Pentagon that says, you are going to be apolitical to the degree that where it matters, certainly for sure."
kroPK01S_ZX,2842,David Axelrod,"But a lot of Republicans do think we should not be pro-Putin and NATO has helped to keep the world safer than it would otherwise be for the last 80 years, and that's an issue. We're there with Biden unambiguously. It's not like some of these other issues where they're in between the two, and I feel like the Biden people could do much more to really press that a little. I was disappointed that they didn't make more. At the time, when Trump single-handedly killed the bill that had funding for Ukraine, Israel, the border, Taiwan, all in one package, and it was negotiated by a very conservative Republican, Senator Lankford, who got left out to dry there. Biden got down to the border three weeks later. They should have flooded the zone in the moment, and that's what they have to be better at. They need to understand that it's not just a one-off thing. You've got a hammer, hammer, hammer away. Because when you're sick of saying something, that's about when the average American has begun to hear the message. And so they've got to be better at that. So this national security thing, I think, is important. One thing, Bill, that I would hope they would be organizing is a show of force among former secretaries of defense, former chairman of the joint chiefs, former senior military and national security leaders of both parties to, at a strategic moment, stand up and say, ""We are Republicans and Democrats and independents."
-7PgECheIiA,5968,Jack Goldsmith,"The military's pretty big norms there of not politicizing too much and so forth. On the other hand, they've talked about having an outside review panel for three and four-star generals and so forth. You want civilian control in the military, but on the other hand you don't... It's pretty important, I think, for the last since the Cold War really to have a somewhat apolitical military. They have their own politics in the sense of jockeying for whatever. So tell me, what do you think about- Well- ... all that? ... so I'll say something about the military, then I want to shift over to the intelligence community if I can, because I'm more worried there. Yeah, please, okay yeah. So look, Rumsfeld, when I was in the Pentagon, he was a wrecking ball and a lot of the things you just said Rumsfeld was doing. And in other words, he thought... And I'm not going to get the details right, I don't remember them, but he thought the way the DOD was organized was wrong. He thought the way people were being promoted was wrong. He thought some of the top people were bad, and he tried to put his footprint or fingerprints or vision on the department and I can't say that that's not sometimes healthy. I don't know."
hNQxqj8aVAd,3639,Doug Sosnik,"And I feel like that gives Trump a cushion that a normal challenger who said these kinds of things doesn't have. I mean, he's weirdly advantaged by being both the challenger, the outsider, the change candidate, and hey, he was president. I mean, there's not that much to worry about. Things were okay when Trump was president. Well, you're right. I think that most people have sort of priced into the stock Trump saying crazy things, but above and beyond the economic narrative that Trump will be able to put out about when he was president compared to now on prices and inflation and the rest, he's also going to be able to say regardless of whether or not he deserves any credit for or not, when he was president though, didn't have a war in Europe, didn't have a war in the Mideast, and aren't getting closer to war every day in Asia. So, I think again, that reinforces this second point that I made earlier about the reason a lot of people supported Biden was to have normalcy back in people's lives, more control with adults in charge. You stress that Biden's job approval hasn't recovered. And I think some people I've talked to over the last two, three months have kept on saying, hoping maybe, ""Well, it's the economy."
TDK696iAqF5,8191,Robert Kagan,"God knows we were anti-Trump in 2016. You were extremely outspoken and vocal and analyzed it, but you could talk yourself into things then that you really shouldn't be able to now. But people literally, as many people are talking themselves into it now. I mean, just empirically, as many people are supporting Trump now as supported him in 2016 or 2020. So that's kind of striking, right? Because he's much more radical in his statements, much more frank- Absolutely. ...than he was. And the movement is so much more radical than it was. There was no Heritage Project 2025 in 2016, or even in 2020, really. Right, right. And with the way people talk about his first term, the way Jamie Dimon talked about his first term, he was good on the economy and he wasn't totally wrong about NATO, and he was maybe sort of right about immigration. And every time we talk about his first term, we don't mention what happened at the end of his first term. Yeah, it is silly. It's as if he did not try to become a dictator in 2020, which by the way, people don't put that clearly enough either. If he had succeeded, if Mike Pence had not shown unaccustomed backbone at that one particular moment and Trump had succeeded, he would've been ruling as a dictator."
QR655TpL0xd,9002,James Carville,"I mean, he's the most Biden-like VP candidate I guess, of the ones who were in the picking. So, Harris went more with the Obama model than the Clinton model. Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. Okay. We kind of went generational. She sort of went steady governance. But I tell you, the people that I know in Minnesota that know him... Apparently, just from the Democratic point of view, he's been very effective and is kind of what you see. And I personally liked Shapiro a lot, would call him a friend of mine, but it would've been a San Francisco-Philadelphia ticket. If you know, that is always kind of bothered me that we are a little too coastal. And it's fresh water, they decided on fresh water and not salt water. And it is basically that simple I think. But my number one pick would've been Beshear, but so be it. Yeah, I feel like that gets you a lot of the... but, whatever. It gets you a [inaudible]. But Walz, I'm so on this train and blowing the whistle and we'll rolling. This is the choice and let's roll. Final question. Speaking of VP candidates, I have a hunch that Vance could hurt actually the Trump ticket a little more than people think. Normally, VPs don't matter much as we've been..."
fODX_xPhh5b,2510,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And just to finish with this, none of this really has big legislative implications, it sounds like this is all stuff Trump can just do. There are some significant legislative implications, and that's really around funding. Same is going to be true for mass deportation. We have a reconciliation bill coming up in the next two months- So let's get to that because that's important, I think. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But in the very first months, he can announce A, B, and C and whatever effect it has, it has on the border, and so yeah- That's right. So, let's get to the next [inaudible]- And the president's power is the strongest really at the border compared to the inside the country. Yeah. Well, I'm saying is on the border, it doesn't sound like he's going to offer a piece of HR2 in the first day, there's no need... It doesn't sound like there's much need for it. So let's get to the internal situation, which mass deportations. We saw those signs at the Republican Convention. And I do think politically also, the numbers of people in New York and Boston and so forth who were assembled there, so to speak, and were straining this social services and all that was part of the political effect. So that led to the mass deportations pledge, or at least made it more popular, I guess."
dopemSc0mjH,6236,Larry Summers,"People all sell and nobody quite knows who it is exactly who is selling. And they have the virtue that they're always open, and so they're sending signals in very rapid response to events. And all of that makes them a powerful force. But I think they're more effective with respect to some issues than with respect to other issues, and I don't think they are sufficient. Something I have learned over time from my own participation in public debates and watching others is that interventions are most effective when they're unexpected. So the impact of Nancy Pelosi shouting from the rooftops or The New Republic and Nation magazines being deeply concerned about civil liberties is much less than voices like yours or voices of Republican senators or business leaders or the kinds of people who President Trump has traditionally been very respectful of. Yeah, it may be that we'll look back on Liberation Day as a tipping point in this direction, in a good way, and that people stop being able to tell themselves it'll be like the first term, he'll be constrained by reasonably responsible advisors and national security policy and to some degree an economic policy. And as you say, tariffs go from 1.5% to 2.5% or something, not tenfold or even fivefold. And I do think the universities have been useful."
3wk3kMLNLC0,7222,AB Stoddard,"And I guess we'll see if they go in that direction. And also knock Trump's-let's get to the Republicans and close with them-but if they knock Trump's numbers down, the argument's always been maybe you get four Republican senators, four Republican house members to jump ship on some votes at least. And then you start to get some fractures in the Republican party. And that does have, I can say this, having been in government, that has an effect on the governing party. I mean, if you start to have to worry about your own members and just the image of losing some of these votes, losing some of your members legitimates concerns among the citizenry. Like, ""Well gee, even these Republicans are worried about what Trump is doing on issue X Bill Cassidy-type thing."" And so anyway, do you think that's practical though? If his numbers get knocked down some, if the Democrats get more energized and use your whiteboard and more effective, do Republicans ever defect? I don't think so because they're only looking out for their primaries and that hasn't changed. So until and unless people stop threatening them in their driveway and on the phone and online, I mean these are real threats to their security if they go against Trump and then they to win their next primary and hold their seats."
DNdMKM7xMCS,6370,Invisible Rulers,"And those people came to be called opinion leaders in this very kind of canonical work that studied how this process happened. And the opinion leaders would talk to their friends, and when those friends were sort of surveyed by social scientists, they would report that they formed their opinions in large part around who to vote for in this election based on what the women in their community were talking about with them. So these opinion leaders kind of became the mediators who took stories from the media and talked about it with their friends, and that was where the influence channels were happening. And this came to be called two-step flow. Two-step flow of information and opinion shaping. And what happens on social media is that the people that you talk to are the people who are also kind of the media. So you're talking to an influencer who is also the person that you sort of see as being this media-like figure, but they're talking to you at the same time. You're having that opinion shaping process happen with the other people who are in the comments. If you go watch a stream on Twitch or something like that, the chat is going at all times, and the person who's speaking to the tens of thousands of people who are watching is picking comments out of the chat and responding in real time."
lE-z--dHC2o,8457,Robert Kagan,"In what way is Donald Trump not an elite? In what way is Steve Bannon not an elite? Populism also suggests that a lot of it is economic. At least traditionally in American history, populist movements have sought, basically, fundamentally economic goals. And I don't think... I don't think, I'm quite confident that this rebellion, just as in the South before the Civil War and later, this rebellion is not about economics. It's about the definition of what America is. Yeah. That's so interesting and important because this does make your book, I think, distinct from a lot of the other books, some of which are good books, on this phenomenon. I think a lot of people might argue, ""Well, it is a populist reaction. It's not fundamentally thought through. It's not fundamentally grounded as much as you're saying in a kind of tradition or a self-conscious understanding. There's some elites who've glommed onto it but..."" I've been struck by this too, though, talking to... the degree to which the conventional view of Trumpism is white working class resentments, ignoring most of the leaders and energizing forces of Trumpism who are not resentful. Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies."
cR9T6v18bfK,6115,Larry Summers,"Look, they backed off there. Look, they're sending signals that they're just going to declare victory and not do anything real."" So that is the disturbing thing. And these things can tip very quickly. One of the first major financial dramas that I witnessed as an adult professional economist was the 1987 crash. And that had its roots in a risky environment, markets were high. That had its roots in there being some problems in the plumbing, lots of portfolio insurances, what it was called in those days. But the match that lit the fire was a spat between our Treasury Secretary, Jim Baker and the German financial authorities, and a question about whether the dollar would be allowed to fall. And investors all of a sudden decided they didn't want to be near this drama and got very alarmed over the weekend. And then on Monday we had a major crash. And that's the kind of event that this all makes us at risk of. It's pretty clear that the first of the many reversals, the reciprocity reversal that took place, came because the Trump administration in a matter of a few hours, became alarmed that this kind of thing could happen imminently. And indeed by all press accounts, the US trade representative was in the midst of testifying in Congress when he learned that there had been this dramatic reversal."
W2_Gswo10Tm,6062,Larry Summers,"Who the president selects as Jay Powell's successor, who the president ... How that person conducts themselves and demonstrates independence is something that will be very, very important. I do think it's important to note, and I think that a lot of these discussions at this moment as the president says things about Jay Powell, yet miss, is that the Fed is an institution, not a person. There's nothing that says that the other six members of the Board of Governors, or that the presidents of the regional banks are obliged to follow the lead of the president. In many other countries, the central bank is more like our Supreme Court in the sense that the Chairman is like the chief justice. The chief justice probably has more influence than the average justice does, but sometimes the votes come down and the chief justice is in the minority. And I think that if there were to be a successful effort to appoint an aberrant chairman, I think that aberrant chairman might find there weren't so many followers for the parade. And so I think there's a bit more insulation that is built into the system than these very personal discussions about chairs of the Fed would suggest. Look, I have said something on the subject of the dollar and things international, that I think that the general kinds of views that I've expressed continue to feel right to me, but in a different way than I used to say."
gLTn0VHpXDH,8805,James Carville,"No, this is like, you do the basic stuff. So somebody say, ""Hey, James. I'm professor of political science at UCSD, and can you do a book blurb?"" And I'll look up the guy and okay, he looks all right. Sure. It's a thrilling book. You should read it. It's full of insight and everybody's done that shit. Okay? We all know that, but man, this is a bridge too far. And I just think you're going to keep finding... Because I kind of think that's who he is. And he's really into this crazy... Look, I think the people that say we need higher birth rates actually have a point. I'm not a guy that just dismisses, but how you achieve it and what else you do and everything else is kind of a, to say to least, a delicate subject. And they want to have some kind of a religious... They do, I'm sorry. And the guy that has been most influential in all this is a guy from Baton Rouge named Rod Dreher. And the press pays too little attention to Rod because he's very there on that kind of nationalistic... He lives in Hungary now, [inaudible] about. But Rod is very, as you know in that world, because you had to deal with it more than most people had to deal with, he's really, really influential."
wcwNPWn-Msk,2941,Eric Edelman,"And I mean in a funny way, not a funny way, but one has to follow a foreign policy more closely I find now than one used to, because it used to be you kind of got the basic thrust of foreign policy. You either liked it or you didn't. It played out in a slightly predictable way though in terms of what the point of what they were trying to accomplish, one could say, well, they're not going to accomplish it successfully or one could say they might. Here, one doesn't know. And I do wonder when you just have so many countries that don't know where we're going, they don't know where each other are going, we're not there to reassure everyone at the end that, okay, we're going to prevent this from getting out of hand, as you were saying. That you've got an awful lot of billiard balls bouncing around without a regulator. That can get... It can be okay for a while, and then suddenly it's not okay. That's what it feels like to me and we need to keep a close eye on it. So you will keep a close eye on it, right? And we'll get back together to discuss when the billiard balls are really breaking or really not breaking or something."
45DvRQnB_tr,9078,James Carville,"Yeah. But everyone was ridiculing him on the Democratic Biden campaign. He's going to a place he can't win, New York. And what's he wasting his time for? I feel like that was pretty effective. He showed that he's willing to go anywhere. He went to an 85% blue area. Biden never goes to an 85% red area. He can say to Hispanics in other parts of the country, ""Hey, I'm willing to campaign anywhere. And I care about you guys."" Maybe- Yeah. I think there ain't much money. And it was cheap, it was convenient. Right. He got a ton of press. Right. I think we could make something about the two convicted felons that he had there. Whatever, but it was right. And he says, ""Oh, I'm going to carry New York. I'm going to carry California."" But most politicians actually deep down think they can do anything. I remember at the end of the '92 campaign, Bill Clinton snuck off and went to Mississippi. ""What the shit is going on there?"" ""Well, William [inaudible] went and Mike Espy said if I came here, they thought I could win."" I said, ""Oh, Jesus."" I saw Mike Espy a year ago. ""What the hell did you do that for?"" But they actually... Bill Clinton thinks, if I can just get in front of the bank president, I can convince him."
vlFTPvnvml-,8300,James Carville,"Yeah. You got to get out of it with some humanity and humor. But if you start explaining structural racism and police reform and community outreach, you're dead. At that point, you're dead. And by the way, Black Lives Matter is a real estate holding company, and they actually started with a pretty good idea. I mean, it's fair to say for 400 years there's been a concerted effort to dehumanize Blacks, particularly Black males. It just is. And when it started, I thought it had a... I had some sympathy for it. And then of course it was what it was... Eric Hoffer said, ""Every movement begins as a cause, morphs into a business and ends up a racket."" They didn't take it long to get to the racket stage at all. So she has this little tour with the two of them for the next week. Then the convention. Anything special about the convention you would recommend? Not recommend? Biden will speak on the first night, I suppose, and exit, which is typically the way you do it with the outgoing incumbent president. I don't know, special message, special teams. What's the key thing to accomplish? I think in the back of my mind, this convention should be about a plan is ""we get you."" And the more that it's like that..."
9woW6rth9Yf,5890,Larry Summers,"It's the kind of thing that in a developing country, you ask yourself whether they're going to have to have an IMF program within a few months when you start to see that pattern develop. We're too big for an IMF program, but we're at risk of a major kind of a financial incident. And- And am I right, If I could just... That there's no reason to have thought six months ago, let's just say, that this would be... I'm not making a political point here really, I'm just being analytical, that this would be happening. That this is a phenomenon of the last two or three months really of the new administration's mode of governance. I think what a fair-minded person would've said a few months ago is, ""Gee, we have a lot more debt than we did and a lot more government debt than we did. And our politics are in general seeming more polarized. So you would've said that we were in a more risky place where we had much less room for error than we might've had room for error 20 years before. But we weren't in some kind of imminent danger. And I think what has happened is in a general environment where we don't have that much room for error, we've started making huge scale error in terms of our attitude towards the rest of the world, our unpredictability, our potential hostility to investors in our currency."
pePS6gx2THn,15254,Anne Applebaum,"And so Trump is breaking with two very important, very long-standing pieces of bedrocks of American domestic and foreign policy. And one of them, the independent civil service, and the other is the network alliances. And those are very radical things to do, which no previous Republican or Democratic President, however, left or right wing has done. Not since 1945. No, absolutely right. That's really well said. And also the patron system. It's one thing to have a patron system when you have a very small federal government, and mostly you're appointing semi- qualified or unqualified people to be local postmasters or maybe to be administering a few GI benefits for civil war veterans. Even there, it blew up and that's why they had civil service reform. It's another thing when you're running massive Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, NIH programs, right? I mean, the level of damage that can be done just by this, I think, is great. I'll let you go in a couple of minutes. It's the third anniversary of the war, obviously, of the attack by Putin on Ukraine. You've covered it so closely. You've been there several times. You wrote about it this morning in The Atlantic . Just say a few words about what we should be thinking about on this day. I think everyone should think back on how they felt at the time of the invasion."
8CvqO1nD8hd,5859,Larry Summers,"But I think it's going to be pretty difficult to do that. I think that an example for better or for worse is various changes in the way the confirmation power has been adopted by the Senate. Once that changes, it has changed and it is very hard to cause it to go back. And I think there will be that kind of tendency going forward. So I think this affects very much the character of our democracy. I think that a big thing is just what happens apart from all the market stuff. This is the equivalent as a supply shock of an increase of perhaps $50 in the price of oil. It pushes up prices proximally. And so because we're paying more for the things we import and because we're paying more for the things we import, we are poorer. And because we're poorer, we spend less. And that means there's fewer jobs and more unemployment. So we have administered a self-imposed supply shock to ourselves. And that's always the most difficult kind of economic problem to deal with because you don't know whether you're supposed to hit the accelerator because of the unemployment or hit the brakes because of the inflation. And so you can't really solve both problems. So I think we've done a very large amount of damage, and I tend to be an optimist about the United States."
A-93zIcAx9P,6858,Aaron Friedberg,"And I think in many ways they're betting on that, counting on that because power is always relative, and power in the Chinese view is the sum total of all different kinds of capabilities, including those related to the strength of the domestic system. So it's not just about what we do or don't do in Ukraine or what we do or don't do with Taiwan. It's also about what we, or happens to us internally and what the implications of that are for our credibility and our ability to act as a power in the world. I mean, that's the deepest source of my concern. Yes, it's about the possible policies that Trump II might follow. And maybe they wouldn't be as bad, and maybe this more traditional strain of thinking would have some influence on various specific questions. But does anyone think that a new Trump administration is going to be suddenly sober and serious about adhering to the law, about resisting the temptation to use its powers to oppress or persecute its domestic enemies? I think we know what we're in for on those counts. And all of that would, in my view, would dramatically weaken the United States, both in practical terms and in moral terms. I mean we're already in a bit of trouble on that score."
jTcQQ4_tQNf,6549,Invisible Rulers,"Again, the weird weeds of tech policy, but Zuckerberg settled a lawsuit with Trump. Trump sued him after he was kicked off the platform after January 6th. There is no universe in which this company would have settled that lawsuit for anybody else. It was unambiguously, absolutely the platform's First Amendment right to kick the President off. That is how the law is structured. But instead, they settled and they gave him a $25 million donation to his library to get in the tent, is how Trump put it. We call that a bribe. So that's politics. We won't get into the politics here. So final thoughts? So it's not entirely... I don't know. On the one hand, you're impressively cheerful about the topic in general. Not about the topic, but in your manner of discussing it. And I guess as you said, it's very important to remind people things weren't great before. We had horrible demagogues succeeding. We had conspiracy theories. We had craziness. And there were good sides. I was very much on the good side of the internet in the '90s and early 2000s, as many, I think, conservatives were. We weren't that friendly to the establishment media. We thought the more people the better. And I just remember going to speaking college campuses and being so pleased that students, this is much more simple-minded, but could have access to my friend Charles Krauthammer's columns, even though they were in The Washington Post and they were in college in Ohio somewhere because of the internet."
xG7sVvhWnQP,13788,Anne Applebaum,"But that they actually, if you had a neutral test, so to speak, they push towards the, I guess we're not quite supposed to call it a neo-Nazi party, but I call it an anti- anti-Nazi party. You know, it's not a very... a very far-right party. Anyway. For our purposes, the interesting thing about it is that it's a pro-Russian party. Very actively pro-Russian. And actually, historically anti-American as well, anti-NATO, anti the European Union. And it's pro-Russian, and of course, the bizarre aspect of this election was, and this has been documented, I've also seen research papers documenting it. There was active Russian support for the AFD, and as you say, active US support for the AFD- Isn't that horrible? ...from Musk and Vance. So you had Musk, Vance, and the Russians working together to support this one party, whose most significant arguments are about taking Germany out of European institutions and stopping German support for Ukraine. They also talk about immigration and that seemed important to Vance. But other parties, the CDU is going to be also limiting immigration. So that's not the most important difference between them and the center right. The difference is that they're pro-Russian. What struck me was that, and this is my glass half full. Since you were going in that direction, I'll go in that direction too, this morning."
eeNTO_DyUaW,16146,Anne Applebaum,"Yeah, no, that's very interesting. They feel it really strongly. So I can say that for sure about Germany. I mean obviously, and the threat from the AFD, as I said, is primarily a threat of what's perceived to be correctly as a pro- Russian party. UK is the same. In the UK, both the current Labour Party and the Tory Party have also been very loud in support of Ukraine and very clear about their... They've also had huge cyber threats from Russia. I mean, actually I was in London a few months ago and just bizarrely- so the British Library, which is one of the great cultural institutions of the English-speaking world, lost an enormous amount of data. I think it lost access to all of its files because of a Russian cyber attack. And people were talking about that when I was in London. So there's this feeling that Russia is a problem for the UK and all kinds of... The Russian money in London has been very notable and obvious over the years, and people have turned against the Russian oligarchs who were living in London for such a long time. So there's been a kind of sea change there as well. France is more complicated, partly because the... France also has a big pro-Russian party, and that was Marine Le Pen's-it's changed its name several times-but Marine Le Pen's French far-right party."
dGqCclgxtIU,3454,David Axelrod,"I just feel like- We also, Bill, have no idea what all these cases, I mean he's going to be tried in New York. That seems pretty clear. We're waiting on a Supreme Court decision and we could get a trial later in the year in Washington on the January 6th case. I mean I'm dubious about that. I mean I'm dubious about whether they're going to ultimately hold a trial that ends in October. Right. The Trump people are delay, delay, delay on all of this, but this is a weird campaign because a lot of it is going to happen in the traditional places. A lot of it's going to happen in courthouses, and you talk about unknown unknowns. Those are the greatest probably. It is striking, isn't it? To the most recent president or the current president, 99.9% name ID so far in the last year pretty small fluctuations I would say in the polls-- Yes, it's also because we're so tribal. We're very tribal and polarized. On the one hand, one's instinct is to say, ""This is what it is. It's kind of stable, but very much on the margin."" Then, you look at all the things that are so unusual and so crazy, 77 year old and 81 year old, legal cases- Two incumbents. ...Dissatisfaction with both nominees, the world and a fair amount of chaos and could be much better, could be much worse."
3txBZJSpoBT,7960,AB Stoddard,"But the self-confidence that came from coming back after January 6 th , crushing his opponents to the Republican primary, probably maybe the failed assassination attempt. I don't know, I assume he's not religious enough to think he really was saved by God, but it certainly gave him some greater sense maybe of destiny or something and then deciding he wanted to run on the real America First, the real Heritage Project 2025 platform. I mean, all that I think just has made the second term so different from the first term, both in theory, in intention, you might say, but also in practice because of those guardrails. And then- I'll just add one thing to what you said is getting, two things and then you talk, please. Getting these people who were so unqualified as nominees and so radical as nominees, Kash Patel as director of the FBI, I mean, no one's ever heard of anything like that really, or obviously the Pete Hegseth as Sec Def... literally incomparable to anyone we've had in that position. Getting them through I think also gave him another shot in the arm. Daring to nominate them was bold, but then I don't know, maybe he sort of thought deep down one or two won't make it, but I'll show that I tried."
RO4PvtYr3He,3636,David Axelrod,"But yeah, this is a concern that Trump's ratings, just as president, there's this gauzy reminiscence of Trump. Now, I think some of that may be allayed, and this may conflict with what I just said, but I don't think the two are contradictory. I think one of the reasons that Trump has begun to slip a little, and there's been some progress for Biden in the last six weeks or so, some of it has to do with Biden being more energetic and the campaign getting more on track, but I think some of it has to do with the primary season ending and Trump getting general election consideration now, and people focusing on the fact that, ""Oh, yeah, he could be president again. This is the choice."" And now, we got quite a bit of coverage of him over the Easter weekend, he always seems, Bill, able to celebrate these holidays by just... He celebrates the sacred by engaging in the profane. Right. It's really, really weird. But he just erupts over Christmas, over Easter. I don't know whether it's because he's confined. I posited on Hacks On Tap that he's jealous that Christ gets all this attention. I don't know. I don't know what it is. But his outbursts over the weekend just remind people that the guy is nuts, and living with him is like a..."
kPwysSlFkKs,5593,Larry Summers,"So what does the Fed do? How worried are you about Fed independence, which I think has been, don't you think, pretty important in allowing us to be the reserve currency at a place where people were happy to come and invest and also to hold dollars in various forms despite the deficits. Because at the end of the day, the Fed was pretty reliable Post-Volcker. How worried... Trump has said he... Now he's backed off. He's said he was not in favor... Wanted to fire Jerome Powell, and now he's not going to fire him. He's still going to replace him in a year, I suppose, when his term runs up. How worried are you about the Fed as one of the pretty important keystone, I think, of this whole happy economic story we've had for quite a long time now? I have told multiple presidents that Fed bashing is a fool's game because the Fed will not listen, and therefore you will not reduce short-term interest rates and the market will listen, and long- term interest rates will go up. So even in terms of its narrow objective of getting interest rates down, public Fed bashing by presidents is a mistake. I think it is worth just remembering, because people can get awfully purist on this subject that a review of dialogues between the Reagan administration and the Fed in the mid-1980s would be troubling to deep advocates of Fed independence."
QqM4M6BS0TJ,2003,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Can I just ask one thing? Just listening to you, it strikes me that often the border is described, and I myself have this vague impression of it's sort of irresistible, these forces, people want to come. There are many millions assembled. It's kind of impractical to keep them out or take draconian measures. But it does sound like you're saying that it's more susceptible to policy initiatives, wise or unwise, but from the US and I suppose from Mexico as well than one might've thought, right? I mean this is not something that's just... Policy matters in terms of the border. Yeah. Yes and no to some extent. So, the ""no"" is that there are of course still tens of thousands of people crossing the border between ports of entry every single month, and there are still thousands who are trying to do so without seeking asylum. For the last decade, we've had a very unusual set of circumstances at the border where we have had very large numbers of people crossing the border and immediately turning themselves in to the nearest border patrol agent to seek asylum, not attempting to evade arrest by sneaking through in camouflage with carpet shoes. The latter thing, people trying to sneak through without being caught is really what the border looked like for most of US history or the last century, really, since we invented the concept of undocumented immigrants by imposing restrictions on immigration."
Pc-hrtFiTNG,9318,Robert Kagan,"They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments. They're in sheriff's offices and all kinds of things. And then you combine that with the pardon power, that's pretty far down the road, isn't it, away from liberalism? I mean, it's sort of like the definition of not being liberal, is cops can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be and vigilantes can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be, or some powers that want to be. It doesn't even have to be the powers that are quite in power yet. Right. Trump is going to play on the fact that even in the center of American politics, people are anxious about crime, although I think the statistics don't bear it out, but nevertheless, it's clear that if you're a Democrat in a city these days, you have to be tough on crime. So when Trump comes in and wants to be tough on crime, he is hardly going to be swimming against the tide."
Plm9lhbAybn,4344,Eric Edelman,"But he knew that going to the Middle East, where he had gone on his first trip in his first term, he would be greeted with sword dances and with, as you say, camels and Arabian stallions and red Cybertrucks and fighter escort for Air Force One and all of the trappings of power that he enjoys and the kind of adulation he requires psychologically, I think, in order to operate at a high functional level. So it was, from that point of view, a great place to start his foreign travels as president. Technically, actually.... Technically though, I think we have to note his first trip was actually to the funeral of Pope Francis. Oh. You're right, good point. Yeah, I missed that. I didn't think of that. So he went to three countries. Frankly, for a lot of Americans, and I'll put myself in that category, they slightly blur together since they're all next to each other and they're all similar backgrounds, you might say, but still very different actually in terms of their foreign policies and what happened in each of those countries. And I guess the order was Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE- United Arab Emirates. But since the headline of the trip became the plane, maybe we should begin with the famous, or infamous, Qatari 747."
dtJyF3C6Jo2,3048,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole. All of those are statuses that can be revoked by the incoming administration. There are different processes that they have to go go through. Parole could theoretically be revoked en masse on day one. DACA, because it's tied up in litigation right now, we cannot rapidly get rid of. There's a whole bunch of legal procedures they'd have to go through, but nevertheless, we expect him to try. And with TPS, the law does provide some minimum time periods before it can be terminated, and it's unclear if he would terminate it for everybody. The single biggest population of people with temporary protective status right now is Venezuelans about 600,000 Venezuelans. Just be clear, these are people for whom there would be a danger of being sent back to their country and that's why they have this temporary status, right? Yeah. So temporary protected status is for people... It's a status that the Department of Homeland Security can grant to any country or even subset of a country where sending those people back would be a problem because of armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other serious issue that would make it dangerous to send them back."
RglpPA_3WQw,2552,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"There is a limit to how many detention beds that are available currently. You'd have to eventually start building new prisons in order to expand capacity. And law enforcement hiring is going to be quite difficult. Law enforcement hiring is difficult right now in pretty much every agency in the country. Local police is having trouble hiring people. The FBI is having trouble hiring people. Everyone's having trouble hiring people for law enforcement jobs. And so even if they fund 10,000, 15,000 new positions, it could take them many years before they actually managed to hire up for all of those positions. Could they try to use the military to shortcut some of this? Well, if Stephen Miller gets his way, maybe. Though it's unclear whether the military would, A, go along with that. There's something called the Posse Comitatus Act that bars the military for being used for domestic law enforcement, though some legal experts suggest that there are ways around that. And then B, the bigger issue is, I think especially when you look at the National Guard, which many of them have proposed...National Guard troops don't want to do this. I think it's pretty easy to say you don't join the National Guard because you want to go around rounding up grandmas. And that is a major challenge for the United States if they go down that path of trying to co-opt the military for this."
oBBIB0MN5sc,5731,Aaron Friedberg,"I kind of have the feeling that there's something that people could see there. They kind of have a common sense view I take it that you can't run major organizations this way, can't run the government this way. The world's a volatile place. You can get into wars by trying to be erratically too dovish and you can give up a lot by being erratically too hawkish. People have a sense of how that would work or do they? I mean, I guess is the risky charge a sensible thing politically? I'm curious for your judgment on that. It's an interesting question, and I haven't thought about it in quite that way, but just as you were speaking, if you think about the history of our domestic politics and presidential politics in particular over the post-World War II period, there are at least a couple of examples where you had candidates on both sides, on one side or the other who were perceived rightly or wrongly as being excessively risky. And Barry Goldwater is one of the reasons he lost by the margin that he did to LBJ, I think, was that Johnson and others probably accurately portrayed Goldwater as too risky because he was cavalier about the use of nuclear weapons among other things. And then of course, a few years later, you also have George McGovern who's portrayed, and again, I think there's some reason to believe that this was accurate, as someone who was too risky because he was going to pull America back from its traditional commitments and not just get out of Vietnam but pull out of our alliances."
wzeK645L_5o,5857,Tim Snyder,"There are a lot of European countries, there are a lot of elections, some are going to go well, some go badly. The Polish election went the right way. The Czech presidential election, as you said, went the right way. The Slovak one went the wrong way. The Italian ones seem to go very much the wrong way from the point of Ukraine, but actually she's been fine with respect to Ukraine, right? So there're going to be elections. There's going to be a British election and Labour is going to turn out to be exactly the same as the Conservatives on Ukraine, maybe even a little bit better. So with the exception of Germany and France, things are going to go back and forth, but I think basically it's going to be okay. Where we'll really have trouble is if Le Pen wins a presidential election in France or if the AfD comes to power in Germany. In those scenarios, then Europe itself is going to have trouble. Yeah. Let's close by talking about the US, which you said was the key link and the weak link, I think you said, or potentially. Well, maybe right now the weak link, and potentially the very, very weak link. What I was struck by I was in Europe a few times, a year ago meeting with pretty senior Germans and I think the [inaudible] is more real than not, a little more glass half full than half empty and especially the younger Greens in Germany have been excellent."
uzwHtqMA6zR,3389,Eric Edelman,"The question though is, first of all, this was done without any kind of deliberative policy process at all. In fact, the administration's counter-terrorism coordinator and Deputy National Security Advisor, Seb Gorka, just on the end of the day before the president left, was fulminating about, ""We're not going to lift sanctions on this jihadi president of Syria."" And there is a question about al-Sharaa because he does have a past link to jihad. He was the head of the Nusra Front, which was an Al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria for some time. They then broke with Al-Qaeda and broke with ISIS. But exactly what that means is still, I think, not clear a hundred percent. So, A, there's a policy question here, which is, if you're going to lift sanctions, you ought to have had some deliberative policy and some strategy for what it is you're trying to accomplish, which presumably would be to stabilize Syria. Two, you would have wanted to consult not just with members of Congress but your allies in the region, notably including Israel, which has a very big interest in what happens in Syria. Neither of those things happened. It's not clear that the president on his own can actually lift all of these sanctions. Some of them are imposed by legislation. Others, like taking Syria off the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, the so-called FTO, requires him to submit a report to Congress, which they then have to approve."
FHPPEaD0dM5,6215,Jack Goldsmith,"You don't see it as much because they don't write opinions about when they say no. This is normal in government or not no but, ""No, you can't do it this way but try it that way."" That position is going to be absolutely important. If it's a person in that position who says yes to everything, that's going to green light a lot of what the Trump people can do, but it's also going to backfire on them. It always does because they overreach. And OLC is a really important office for using law to prevent policy overreach. On the other hand, if you have a great lawyer in there who is calling it like he or she sees it, that could be hugely valuable to the president. Because the truth is the president has a lot of room to run on executive power, but it would be a more credible place if you had someone saying, ""No."" I'm doubtful at this point that the Trump administration is going to get someone in there like that. But I do think it is in their interest, they might not see this. It is in their interest if they get a great lawyer who's on board for their conception of executive power, but is not on board for being a yes person."
tt2qOW62vWU,7902,AB Stoddard,"I don't know what it does to Trump who's planning to stay in a third term, but I know that it'll cause his disapproval to rise and Republicans to be feeling some pain. Oh, that's interesting. You've already mentioned HHS and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I guess I didn't even mention him earlier in the unbelievable cascade of confirmations... Patel and Bondi I think are awful. But you could see from a party loyalty point of view maybe why some of the Republican senators- she's the Florida AG, Patel worked on The Hill, Hegseth, someone they all knew from Fox. They had no such reason to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He'd been a Democrat until yesterday and sort of on the left insofar as he had political views and hostile to a lot of the groups that the Republicans and the Senate like, like the drug companies and pharmaceutical companies and so forth. And to say nothing of NIH and people who- major parts of the government that fund institutions that are important to a lot of these members and their states, and the idea that they just confirmed him and the journal was sort of against him... They were worried about him, but they didn't really go to the mattress on it. And then suddenly now it's like, oh my God, he's our worst fears."
mSF60dzQtaz,8194,A.B. Stoddard,"And that's a pretty big amount. And then bring the voters after a few more headlines who were telling Sarah's focus groups a while ago, ah, I'm worried about him winning. I'm worried about the baggage. So maybe a few more polls that are good for Biden. This is entirely possible. And as you know, Bill, I hope this happens, and I hope that Ron DeSantis is the nominee and not Trump, because I think the threat of Trump is so dangerous. But all that has to happen. He has to find some comfort, some actual physical comfort in the role of being on that stage and under those lights and pressure of those questions. And he has to then have the confidence that he can beat Trump. And this is why he needs to. You have to tell the voters, he has to be beaten, and this is why. This is why I do it. And if you can't articulate that, you don't often do it. No, I think that's well said. And that's such an important point. And Trump does look cheerful in his own way and at home, comfortable, certainly on the stage. I mean, that was, for me, the take. I was traveling during the CNN Town Hall, and I'm curious to get your thoughts on that, very curious."
qU6gXBrlYWz,6304,Larry Summers,"No, absolutely. I do really think that it is important though to understand that it really is better if you're unhealthy because you're eating a gallon of chocolate ice cream every day, then you're unhealthy despite having a terrific diet. No, no. No, I take that point, that's a very important- I think that is a very important point to recognize about our current moment. Right. It's a good point and let's end on it. And it's, as you say, mostly a hopeful point, so that's a good thing to end on too. Larry Summers, thank you so much for joining me again and us again for this very, very interesting and thought-provoking conversation. Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
yKJD4PtwtxW,9259,James Carville,"Can be common sense, mainstream left of center, I guess you would say, kind of ideas. People like that. She can start with the extension of the tax cuts on incomes over $400,000 that are going to expire next year. These are places that you can start and you can act prospective and future oriented. I think that's important also. Let's go over those a little bit more, though. There's the bio side and let's say the issues side. On the biographical side, anything particular she should stress apart from just being pleasant and charming and all that stuff, obviously. Look, her bio is not all American. I think both of her parents were professors at Berkeley. I don't have anything against Berkeley, but she doesn't have a bootstrap story. I think she grew up relatively affluent. College professors don't starve to death. I don't know. She's got a lot of people and she can talk about it, but I don't think her bio is... That that's the kind of thing that she's going to win this on. It's fine to talk about it, experiences she had. I think if I were her, in terms of my past experience, I would talk more about being an AG and being a consumer advocate and being a DA and being tough on crime seems to be kinda in right now, if I say so myself."
cxekGwx1oGB,5368,Tim Snyder,"We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people and say rah-rah when there's not a vote for Ukraine aid. They're not really hiding it from anybody, that this is what they're up to. Their propaganda is basically an alternation between we're trying to destroy the Ukrainians and, oh look, we have new pets in America, which is how they describe the people who do what they want. Because they simultaneously praise them, and they're incredibly condescending about them as well. They refer to Trump, for example, as Nashatrampushka , which is our little... I don't know, like ""our little Trump darling"" or something. They praise American political figures, but also in the sense that they're just these things we cuddle because we like them so much. That's how they talk about Tucker Carlson as well. He's very courageous compared to the other Americans, but he's also completely our person. It's broken his head a little bit. Yeah. Sorry to take so much time to answer it, but it's just a really simple yes. They make it 100% clear that this is what they're doing, and it's only... They know, unfortunately, that we're so narcissistic that we don't even notice."
e9qwazXAuBJ,10091,James Carville,"It goes back to the original point. She's not really that well known. And the first person to grab a paintbrush and start painting is going to be the memory. And we have a shot because it could be hard for them to break through. Are you surprised? I think the relative failure of the Trump campaign to define her negatively over these first two weeks... I mean, I kind of expected them to really come out of the box with stuff on her that from 2019, if only those, what she said then to really dump a lot of... spend a lot of money in the swing states. But maybe she's just had so much momentum that it didn't penetrate. She's had a very good two weeks. But do you agree that the Trump campaign's had a not very good two weeks? This is why The Bulwark exists. Something is going on at Mar a Lago, I'm not sure what it is. That Black journalist thing? Some people actually think that was planned, but this guy, LaCivita, Susie Wiles, they're not stupid. I mean, they've won elections before. And what's coming out of there is... you're right, they don't know where to go. They let it get away from them. It was like they got hit in the... And they were totally..."
DowgLOMVkSX,7511,James Carville,"I mean, you call people what you want, but that argument is beyond silly. But it is interesting, they never got a vote. Yeah. What attacks on Trump are most effective in your judgment? There's been... Democracy does work. It doesn't work. Weird works, it doesn't work. I don't know, the numbers that spooked me and I think you and Sosnick and others was retrospectively, people think they were better off under the Trump presidency. That's a bit of an uphill climb if that number stays the way it is, I guess. But anyway, just what would your two or three points be? I would have three attacks. You ready? Drum roll, please. One, past. Two, yesterday. Three, stale. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, those sounds familiar to each. It sounded like one attack, not three attacks. Okay. Yeah, that's called the idea that you're- I got the point. That was quick of me. ...saying three things but you're saying one thing because... The political science department at UMass, Amherst is actually pretty good. And they do a very good poll, like I do. They release it over the week. It is good. ""The reasons to vote for Harris,"" you have to look at it. Protect Social Security, Medicare, 32. Will fight for reproductive rights, 32. Represents the future, 66. So just take the obvious, which is he is yesterday, he wants to go back."
hJTDS9G2PuU,6871,Jack Goldsmith,"I mean, I don't know, it must have been something to go through that. I mean, you capture that a bit in the book. But I do feel like that is somehow healthy maybe, somewhere between- Yeah, I agree. ... you don't have to have shouting matches with the vice president or chief of staff, or whatever you had with that. But I mean, there's some healthy tension there and I guess one... I don't know how much that will be there. Yeah, this is a hugely important point. I mean, it may be the most important position in the Trump administration that hasn't yet been announced is the Office of Legal Counsel, the job I used to have. And the reason this is such an important job, I'll just give for listeners a little bit of background. This is the office in the Justice Department that exercises authority. The President of the United States has the authority to interpret law for the Executive Branch. That's a function of the executive power and the Take Care Clause. And the president delegates that to the attorney general who delegates that to the Office of Legal Counsel. And that means on all of the hard questions that are going to come up, is the Federal Advisory Committee Act constitutional? Can the president impound these funds?"
AqZZzU4g3y3,6515,Jack Goldsmith,"This is the thing maybe at the top of my list that I hope doesn't happen. And how much-you've been inside the Justice Department-how much, I have the vague sense, how much is an Attorney General call on a lot of these things? How much autonomy have FBI directors had in the past? And how much is that simply a subordinate matter for the AG? And then, I guess the White House connections to justice is also important. There have been certain barriers and norms there in the past. There have been barriers and norms in the past. The ""White House Contacts Policy"" is what it's called, but the White House contacts policy does not apply to the president. It never has applied to the president. It's really about ensuring that communications between, I'm simplifying, but the communications between the White House and the Justice Department go through certain channels and are limited in certain ways, but it just doesn't apply to the president. The FBI Director has lots of independent discretion about what investigations to pursue, but the FBI director also formally or technically works for and inside the Justice Department that the Attorney General leads. So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter."
Z0WAnjsPr7L,3357,Doug Sosnik,"But a little bit of me thinks, I don't know, if two thirds of the country doesn't want these guys, and they're going to both clinch, let's assume, their party's nomination. I mean, Biden already has, but... On March 5th, on Super Tuesday. The headlines on March 6th will be, okay, it's over. Primaries are over. Let's assume Trump wins almost every state against Haley. And voters look up. Sarah Longwell finds in her focus groups voters don't quite understand. They haven't quite internalized that this is the choice. There's still a little bit of, ""I don't know, this is February. Something will happen. The Democrats could switch candidates. Maybe Trump, something could even happen with him."" ...A little less of that, I'd say. I just feel like voters look up on March 6th and think, ""Oh my God."" And then it's April 6th, and then it's May 6th, and then it's June 6th. We're not even at the conventions yet, right? Biden's not getting any younger. Trump's not getting less extreme in some ways, I don't think. I don't know. Is a third party thing possible, independent candidacy possible even this year? Could the tectonic plates be totally powerful and strong until something really happens? I don't know. I just feel a little bit like that's more possible than I would've thought a few months ago."
UkgSHlaEt5N,5843,Tim Snyder,"And then of course, I think they were fortunate with their leadership too. I mean, it's kind of an argument for democracy that somebody as improbable as Zelensky would win an election. Then people like, ""Okay, well, this guy, he's just, what can he do?"" But it turns out that thinking in terms of how to communicate and thinking in terms of the grand stakes are things that a properly trained actor can do. And that turned out to be very, it's still very important, but very important in the first year. But I think fundamentally it comes down Bill to just this basic notion that Ukraine's actually a real place, and Russia isn't the thing that it's convinced us that it is. It's something which is more fragile and more new. Yeah, that's great. I mean, in Ukraine, a Ukrainian friend of mine, acquaintance of mine here in DC, we were having a long conversation about this and she was asking why Americans don't understand sort of that this is not only worth fighting and worth winning and worth helping them, but it'd be hugely important to have a stable, free, liberal democratic Ukraine right where it is as a real ally and it's a positive. It's not just doing the right thing and helping a country that's dealing with a terrible neighbor."
thtUWEIr3Od,8391,Robert Kagan,"But in terms of this kind of anti-liberalism all in the Republican Party, so that even though this portion of the population is actually shrinking, whites are shrinking as a proportion of the party, obviously white Protestants are shrinking as a proportion of the country, I should say, in the Republican Party they're an increasingly large force to the point where I think that the leadership can't ignore them anymore. So it's that national sorting, which leads to the strange predicament that we're in right now. It's the fact that all of the anti-liberals in the South and in the North are all in the Republican Party at this point. Whereas FDR could sort of balance the Southerners and the Northern ethnic groups and machines, and then in the Republican Party you could get a Willkie, or a Dewey, or an Eisenhower to beat back the other forces. What you're saying in a way is that beneath that sort of consensus, what's the difference between Willkie and Roosevelt, or Eisenhower and Stevenson, or Kennedy and Nixon? There's some truth to that I guess, or whatever, but beneath that surface consensus, there's stuff under the surface that we sort of tend to slide over in our normal histories. Right. And well, we don't slide over it, we just don't take them very seriously."
wFsOJ8K2Hdy,6307,Jack Goldsmith,"But I do think it is in their interest, they might not see this. It is in their interest if they get a great lawyer who's on board for their conception of executive power, but is not on board for being a yes person. And I guess I'm thinking about your experience right, it's been a while since I looked at the book, but so correct me on that. I mean and explain this more, but I mean of course, you by yourself could have been overridden by either- Yes. ... I suppose the AG or by the White House and presumably you had- I was once. I was once and I talked about it. Go ahead, sorry. But you had also had at times were supported even in somewhat tense and difficult- Yes. ... moments, situations by I say White House counsel or White House Chief of Staff- Yes. Or the president personally or the AG and that I think is also important, right? You could have the whole structure... there was a certain... I mean Bush made mistakes in the War on Terror, no question, and there was plenty of usual kind of politics and favoritism I suppose and stuff. Right. But something of a culture of, well, no, we can't really, if the serious person says this is just wrong or bad law, we can't quite just ignore it and- This is getting a little bit in the weeds, but especially when it comes to criminal law and without relitigating old disputes or going into too much detail, with the Terror Surveillance Program we in the Justice Department ruled that parts of it couldn't go forward under earlier interpretations because we just thought they were dead wrong."
cApt9Sio-oZ,7026,A.B. Stoddard,"And we'll do it again soon, I hope. Oh, thanks Bill. It's always so much fun. Thank you. And thank you for joining us on Conversations with Bill Kristol ."
TtzcXI7lbu4,15040,Anne Applebaum,"They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. And so there's a qualitative difference. You see, online, people saying, ""Oh, well, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement."" No, this is not. This is a break from the conservative movement. It's a break from 80 years of foreign policy. It's a break from more than a hundred years of having an independent civil service. The independent civil service also has a history. It comes from the late 19th century when Theodore Roosevelt was one of the leaders of something called civil service reform. Before that, prior to that, we had a system called the spoils system, which was essentially patrimony. The patronage rather, sorry. Whoever was in power got to hire and fire everybody, the postmasters in all the states and so on, and hire whoever he wanted. And that meant that these were people's cousins and they were brother- in-law and they weren't qualified. And Theodore Roosevelt started the idea that there should be a permanent civil service that has qualifications and that developed over more than a century. And so Trump is breaking with two very important, very long-standing pieces of bedrocks of American domestic and foreign policy. And one of them, the independent civil service, and the other is the network alliances."
lh4hL-tus5V,3436,Doug Sosnik,"So interesting. And maybe we'll close on this, but you think a lot about the parties as institutions as well as who's the candidate this year. The parties seem so different now. A, each different from what they were, but, B, I mean, you have a Democratic Party which really is a coalition of interest groups and views and governors, and so if Biden just steps aside, there'd be people who prefer Newsom, people who prefer Whitmer, Shapiro, Vice President Harris. There are teachers unions delegates, and there'd be various kinds of ideological groups, and moderates versus AOC fans, and people like me would say, ""Hey, look how Suozzi won in Long Island by being a moderate,"" and other people would say, ""No, you need the energy of a Bernie Sanders."" Whatever. I feel like that's more like a traditional American political party, though, in some ways. The Republican Party really is... I mean, when people say cult of personality, they're sort of missing, I think, the key. It is a movement, though, of a kind that you don't see that often in America. I mean, the degree to which it is based around one person, Trump, but then by now it's got a pretty big associated bunch of not just issues but attitudes, and stances towards institutions and towards the past, and repudiation of the recent past of that party in a really dramatic way, right?"
CO7WXyFK1mo,7802,Robert Kagan,"And now we are seeing this reaction to the immigration flow that began in 1965. The interesting thing is that, and as I try to argue in the book, the problem for the anti-liberals and the white nationalists and the white Christian nationalists is that they closed the door way too late. So many tens of millions of immigrants had come into the country and totally changed the complexion and changed the political balance in the country. And that has happened again because of the reforms of 1965 to the point where, and this is my one sort of optimistic note at the end, is that that is going to play a role in our political system. And obviously we're not many years away from being a majority-minority country. This sort of white anxiety is going to be intense, but they are a shrinking portion of the population. They're going to be a shrinking portion even of the Republican Party, unless the Republican Party itself shrinks. And so I just don't know how they can manage to hold on to this too much longer given the way the demographics are shifting. This was the argument against you to kind go, to use your argument against this mild moment of optimism, sudden unusual moment of mild optimism here, it would be to say, ""Well, but anti- liberalism can also appeal to elements of these minorities,"" as you just said, the Italians, the Irish, the Catholics."
d4GRZFE7J3o,17512,Anne Applebaum,"I think back on that and think where we are now and we now have this enormous Ukrainian army, and Ukraine has links and contacts all over the world and allies all over the planet and friends inside the United States and Europe. It's an amazing achievement. Let's take a step back and think where we were and where we are. The Russians did not win. They cannot win, actually. I don't think they can win without Trump. They could not win on the battlefield. Supposedly the second- largest army in Europe has been blocked by what was supposedly what they thought and what they described as a bunch of peasants. And it's just a reminder to us all of the hubris of great powers, which has hit us at times in our history, and also the weakness of the autocratic message. The Ukrainians believe in grassroots democracy, in an open society. They have created networks of civil society who help the army and who work in defense. The army itself is, mostly at this point, a civilian army. People were doing different kinds of jobs three years ago, and yet they have put up this extraordinary defense. I mean, I think whatever happens next, the example Ukraine has set other societies for how you resist autocracy and how you stand up to violence and brutality."
4D4IfkUSoHO,8559,A.B. Stoddard,"And McCarthy's kind of got his budget through the house and is sitting there saying, hey, we've got to negotiate here. Let's speed up the negotiations. It's a little thing. I don't think it matters. Ultimately, what matters is what happens. But it is striking that all the assumptions one makes about who might have the upper hand in each of these cases, often they're not, they're just not right. It doesn't turn out that way. Yeah, I've been wrong a lot, and I'm happy to be wrong. It's kind of part of the fun that you can't really predict it. But we'd like to predict that Trump is not going to be the next president. That's what we would like to be able to predict. Because that's what matters. That prediction's going to be pretty right. No problem. No question at all. Oh, okay. Okay. Take it to the bank. You heard it from... Okay. ...A.B. Stoddard here on Conversations with Bill Kristol on May 16th, 2023. A.B., Thanks a lot for doing this again. And we'll do it again soon, I hope. Oh, thanks Bill. It's always so much fun. Thank you. And thank you for joining us on Conversations with Bill Kristol ."
W1Nt62NVXzr,9374,Mark Esper,"It'll be a far different world for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Or a world in which Putin could just invade a neighbor and slaughter people and then get away with it, keep a good chunk of the territory or all of it. Yeah. After World War II we said never again, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, just to transition to President Trump a little bit, I mean, you've eloquently articulated this view that I certainly agree with, and the President doesn't really quite agree with that in terms of the importance of the post-World War II global order, the US centrality, the importance of the Allies. I mean, you've worked with them closely and you, as I say, I think helped him do some good things and stopped him from doing some things he shouldn't have done. But in foreign policy, I guess, what would a Trump second term look like in your view, and I guess especially given the centrality of Ukraine and NATO? Well, look, I think you have to take President Trump and any leader for that matter at their word, and Trump has been explicit with regard to what he would do. With Ukraine, he said he'd cut off funding, cut off support, and he would negotiate an agreement within 24 hours. Yeah, what is that?"
3AtZOYkFRy1,3442,Eric Edelman,"We're war fighters, we're bombing the hell out of them."" What was that all about? How did that all work out? Well, I mean, what's happened, look, there was an argument for a more robust policy than the Biden folks were willing to undertake against the Houthis who were in fact disrupting international shipping through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. What seems to have happened is that although the CENTCOM Commander General Kurilla, who is an extremely impressive military officer, I might add, anticipated that there might be a US very aggressive air campaign against the Houthis that would facilitate a joining together of the opposition groups in Yemen against the Houthis. So that would be a ground element as well that would perhaps take back the port and also the capital Sanaa from the Houthis. In the event, that has not eventuated, in part, I think because the Emiratis and Saudis are really the main sponsors of the opposition to the Houthis. I think the Emiratis had some real reservations. The Saudis might've been more willing to go along, but it didn't happen. And as a result, although we have targeted the Houthi leadership allegedly and killed a number of them, it's a little bit hard to evaluate the claims because CENTCOM has not provided any briefings nor has the White House, so it's been very difficult to measure by any metric the success of the campaign."
5C_TAExiTqy,5275,Aaron Friedberg,"If Trump wins, we're in a whole different world. In my view, it's likely to be a much darker one. Oh, that's good if somewhat bracing thing to end on. I would say with Harris, I think also the fact that she'll be sort of a next generation candidate who doesn't have a very well established foreign policy record, unlike Biden, is both an opportunity and of course a risk. I mean, as you say, we don't quite know where she'll go and who will influence her, but she might also read your article in Foreign Affairs and say, yes, that's a model for how to go forward. Whereas in a way, Biden wasn't quite interested in new models for how to go forward. He was interested in strengthening the old alliances, which was better than destroying the old alliances. So that was good. So I don't know, the Harris thing will be an interesting actual thing to watch and to try to influence, I suppose. Well, I don't know about you and we're not as old as Biden, but we're not as young as we used to be. Yes, there is an inclination to kind of fall back on the modes of thought and the ideas that you've had. And it's true. People who are newer to the scene and newer in dealing with these problems may have the advantage of being able to consider a wider array of possibilities than a more experienced leader might."
VWKwe_Sd7g6,2955,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on. So we could see 2 million people lose their ability to live here legally and to work. That doesn't mean they're going to be deported, however, because when you lose the status, you just kind of become undocumented. So he could render 2 million people fully undocumented as opposed to what they are now, kind of semi-documented. They don't have permanent status, but they do have temporary status. You could just get rid of that and sort of put them in the population of the undocumented and then make efforts to deport them. But they would still too have to go through the immigration court backlogs potentially. And then when it comes to legal immigration, of course he can cut legal immigration much more easily than any of this. It's much easier for the president to stop people from entering the country- Yeah, say a word about that because of course, the famous Muslim ban in the first term was that. It wasn't removing people who were here, or it wasn't stopping people at the border particularly."
he-XErKST_0,6212,Aaron Friedberg,"And I suppose that's what the Israelis are hoping for. It's also striking to me just one more second on the Middle East that Israel hits Yemen, it's a take because the Houthis had launched, I guess, missiles at Israel... Yes. ...a pretty big attack, it sounds like, from the air on the Houthis in Yemen, which again, is something which just, it barely makes it up to page nine, or the virtual page nine, on the websites. It's a big, once upon a time, that would've been a big story, I think, Israel flying quite a long way away to do this, but getting apparently a green light, yellow light, from a lot of the Arab nations. And then we, I guess, conducted two raids in Syria in the last, or against Syria, against Al-Qaeda and ISIS-type forces in Syria, in the last two weeks. We announced them after we had done them... Yes. ...which I suppose is prudent. But again, it is barely, it was like in the headlines. We're using, it seems like pretty, not major, but a significant counterterrorism operation there, too. And direct involvement of the U.S., that was- Right. And I guess, although we can't be sure what's going to happen next, what's striking, and maybe one of the reasons that these events don't get as much attention as they might otherwise is, the expectation in the past might've been any action is going to lead to some enormous and catastrophic reaction."
RafbYYu70vn,8063,A.B. Stoddard,"So that instills some hope in the people who want to keep supporting him. And then to come out and unveil a whole slew of Iowa endorsements and then a whole slew of New Hampshire endorsements, the ones from New Hampshire yesterday totaled 51, both lists had people that the Trump campaign had said were endorsing them that turned out to be false information. What a surprise that these state legislators, Bill, had not actually endorsed Trump. They were somewhere maybe in talks with the DeSantis camp and they get on DeSantis's final list of supporters and have to say, ""Look, I don't know why I was ever put on Trump's list."" So, he's trying to needle him in, but not directly. And so, it doesn't look bad. It looks better than it did five days ago or a week ago. Winning New Hampshire and or Iowa would make a big difference, but some other stars I think have to align between now and then, which is Trump needs to be weighted down more. If there is a Georgia indictment or a Jack Smith indictment on Mar-a-Lago documents, he needs to be weighted down and there needs to be some serious chorus that started the other day with Senator Todd Young from Indiana, Senator Mike Rounds from South Carolina saying, ""Wait a minute about the-"" South Dakota."
G29EsyW6P6o,8614,Mark Esper,"And fortunately, we rehearse these things and we were able to solve it, but it's just stuff like that that no CEO is going to have to deal with or anybody for that matter, but that's what you have to be prepared for. And that was not unique, that happened more than once on my watch and other things happen as well that just pop up in the news. So more often than not, you're addressing problems and putting out fires. And that's the nature of the job though, the tough things get pushed up and that's what you accept when you take these jobs. I'm curious, just maybe one last question about the Pentagon in general, I mean, we're on the spectrum of, it's a pretty amazing machine that has very good people working there. As you said, both civilian and military has figured out how to do an awful lot of things over the years and decades and it needs competent management, God knows and sound policy direction and ethical policy direction and so forth. But it runs well to the other side of this argument, which is serious [inaudible], it needs pretty big reform, it's very slow to change, it procures weapons that would've been useful 15 years ago, it's hard to shake things up. What's the sort of balance of truth between those two polls?"
gZ4cvZYl5WJ,5681,Tim Snyder,"They have held off, in large measure, a genocide. Wherever the Russians occupy, they have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people. Holding off a genocide is not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. There won't be a war in Europe so long as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army, because there's no way the Russian army can fight another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course, it can. And in my view anyway, they've made a war with China much less likely because they're showing how offensive operations are complicated and unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist Party that doesn't want to be embarrassed is going to pay attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who are willing to take risks for democracy, which is a pretty important example, I think, for us and for everybody. They're doing all those things for us. I think that's where the conversation should start. And then it's like, ""Okay, well then what are we doing for them? For this strategic bonanza and this moral example, what are we doing in return?"" I think that's where the conversation should be starting."

This was around the election, around 2015, 2016 timeframe, so the Hillary Clinton emails and all that stuff. And so I wound up with Pizzagate. And then I logged back in for something. I wanted to get some screenshots related to some of the chemtrail stuff that I was paying attention to. And I wound up seeing QAnon content. And this was before QAnon was really in the news. So again, it's this progression where- So if you like one conspiracy, the algorithm thinks you'll like other conspiracies. RENÉE DIRESTA: Correct. Exactly. QAnon wouldn't have existed... Like, this is a hill I'll absolutely die on. QAnon wouldn't have existed to the extent that it does today without the recommendation engines pushing all of those people into that group, into those groups. There were many of them by that point. There were hundreds of thousands of people in these groups because the algorithms were bringing them together. Because as far as they were concerned, the highest good, if you will, was an active group, because an active group for them, because what they were optimizing for, show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome, the incentive, the optimization is: getting people talking. Well, conspiracy theorists will talk all day long, because they're in there digesting the ""Q drop.""

And I suppose just to conclude on this, those of us who might hope and people from different points of view about actually the numbers we would want to have coming in and how legal immigration should be structured and H-1B and all that sort of stuff, and high-skilled versus less skilled, and whatever one's thoughts... People's hopes for a more rational, competent, effective immigration policy and less of a totally confusing, as you say, smorgasbord of policies, but also obstacles that almost everyone agrees are foolish or counterproductive or just arbitrary. It sounds like the hope for fixing all that over the next four years is not great, right? I mean, that's what people have tried to do with these comprehensive bills understandably, and it's not going to be any easier when you run into people and they say, ""Oh my God..."" These are people who are PhD students or whatever and want to stay. I mean, I'm not talking about even...

I mean, I feel like that would be the next step for those people, right? Well, two data points on that. One was that, remember Ron DeSantis said, ""Well, I don't want to fight a proxy war with China either,"" right? He did go all the way. He said, ""I don't want to fight a proxy war with Russia and Ukraine, and I also don't want to fight a proxy war with China."" So I always thought that was the place to go, but then I can never pronounce this guy's name, Sohrab Ahmani, what is his name? Sohrab Ahmari, yeah. Yeah, yeah, has written a lonely piece saying, ""Why are we so opposed to China? Don't they have the kind of moral system that we would like to have in the United States?"" You know what I mean? You could say China is communist, but in many respects, China is also just a traditional authoritarian regime that is also suppressing what a lot of people in America right would call excessive liberalism, et cetera."
8IAnYZM6qMH,3307,Doug Sosnik,"Explain that a bit. I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don't think have either thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary Clinton's campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message. And you just simply can't run for President of the United States without giving people a reason to vote for you. Now, look, at the end of the day, if Biden were to win, it's going to be largely because of opposition to the Trump. But he does have an obligation, as I point out in the New York Times piece, to do what Ronald Reagan did in 1980. The country didn't want to vote for Carter, but they had real reservations about Reagan. They had reservations about his age, they had reservations about his temperament. They had reservations about whether or not he was a little bit kind of a crazy right- winger. And despite the fact that Carter was in the high thirties or low forties for the entire campaign, it was a three-way race. It was only at the end, after the only debate, the end of October, did they coalesce around Reagan and support him. And it wasn't because Reagan did so well in the debate, and he killed Carter."

One is cleaning house, so to speak, getting rid of people that they think are disloyal, under the guise of reform. And then, there's using the tools of the Department to investigate and prosecute people. And both the FBI director and the Attorney General are directly involved in those things. So their decisions are going to be vital. It's going to be interesting. They have to go before the Senate. They're going to be asked about all of these things. They're going to have to explain what they're going to do. I know that there will be many senators, including on the Republican side, that would like to see the lawfare end. There are a lot of people, on the Republican side, that think the best way to end the lawfare is to really hit them hard with the lawfare, as a kind of tit for tat strategy. This is the thing maybe at the top of my list that I hope doesn't happen. And how much-you've been inside the Justice Department-how much, I have the vague sense, how much is an Attorney General call on a lot of these things?"

He would've basically succeeded in annulling a fair election and held onto power and would've been ruling illegally. So he was perfectly willing to go down that road, and he's made it very clear that he is perfectly willing to go down that road again. I don't know what people need to hear to make a judgment about these things. You hang around with all kinds of people I don't hang around with. What is the common answer to that point? If the guardrails held on January 6th. I mean, it would have cost- So we're electing a... I mean, it's stupid of you and me to have an argument about this as a proxy for other people. But so what you're saying is, yes, he may well try to become a dictator again, and I'm going to vote for him because somebody else is going to stop him from being a dictator, not me. But that's literally what Bill Barr is saying. Not me. Right. I mean, the next Bill Barr will say, and again, what he's made very clear that he's not going to put the Mike, whatever you think of them, the Mike Pences and the Bill Barrs in charge again."

But yes, Trump is going to just get on state ballots. His loyal minions will put him there, and he is just going to full steam ahead, run again. So I think it is, it's the headline of his authoritarian movement. He plans to never leave, and I think it's really essential that that gets into the media discussion. Eventually voters will pick up on it, but it's not, oh, isn't that funny? He's just doing that so he has more influence now because he doesn't want to be called a lame duck. No, it's real. And Democrats should treat it like a real plan because just days ago, he didn't even wait until 100 days or a year, just days ago. He said, oh yeah, we talk about it all the time.

Well, they get it, they're just sort of half on the other side maybe at this point, but- I think Hungary gets it. They're just choosing- Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. But what about, because that would be, I mean, I want to come back to Ukraine itself because that's so important, but it's certainly been a major effect, don't you think? Of the invasion and of the re-invasion or secondary, well, not secondary, but second invasion of February 24th to really change, seems like at least, change perceptions throughout NATO, change the membership of NATO. I mean, how big is all that or is that a temporary thing and it kind of subsides and? I think no, I think it's more than temporary. I mean, look, the fact that Finland and Sweden have abandoned neutrality, Finland's neutrality has been a thing for about a century, a little over a century. Sweden's has been something for about 200 years, right? I mean, these are not sort of recent fads."

It's not just that they're tolerating it, it's what they like. Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not literally necessarily '20s, '30s European fascism, but that's something... I don't know. I had the more conventional, I was an anti-communist.

Some of it's true, but it's a mistake to dismiss him in that way. It was... What was the line from Casablanca, when Humphrey Bogart is talking to the Nazi guy, and the Nazi was ridiculing blundering Americans, and he said, ""I wouldn't be too hard on them, I was with them when they blundered into Paris,"" in whatever the year was. Yeah. So you can call Trump a blunderer, but he blundered into the White House, so you've got to take him seriously. So a few other things I would be thinking about if I were Biden, one is I do think he's getting chippier. I've said, for a long time, I would encourage that, but I would encourage it in ways like this, I think he should say stuff like, ""I don't think acting like a jackass makes you strong."" Just colloquial, direct take on that whole sort of strength persona of Trump. I mean, just sort of bits of Bidenisms that make Biden look both strong and rooted. So that would be one thing. He joked with him the other day about spotting him three strokes on a golf course if he would carry his own bag."
jmcmka-o9sj,6848,Larry Summers,"Wherever it starts, the ball rolls to the bottom of the bowl. A ball on a football field has lots of equilibrium. Wherever the ball gets kicked, it stops and it rests. And systems are sometimes subject to a kind of cyclicality. Joe McCarthy came, the system processed through Joe McCarthy, and yes, it contributed to some dynamics in the 1960s, but you would probably have said that by 1970, whatever America's problems were, they were kind of not very different because we had the very bad Joe McCarthy episode. But sometimes events cast a permanent or near permanent shadow on the system, and I think that it is very likely that what we are seeing will have that kind of effect as future historians look back at things. And I suppose if the country fully repudiated this experiment and goes, ""We can never go back."" But went forward to a more stable governance. If it fully repudiated this experiment, then you're right, that might actually be what's happening. But it's difficult to do that. I agree. But I think it's going to be pretty difficult to do that. I think that an example for better or for worse is various changes in the way the confirmation power has been adopted by the Senate. Once that changes, it has changed and it is very hard to cause it to go back."

Physicians, executives and pharma companies. I don't know. I am a little struck that people may be underestimating that side of things. Do you think that's possible? I do. This is going to affect a lot of people in the months to come in ways that they yes, don't yet realize. Look, it was very interesting how much Trump and his lieutenants made clear to Republican senators that Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat, and RFK junior, a former Democrat, were politically a very important part, a prize for Trump in his reelection. An important part of building a broader coalition that would win him reelection and win over nonpartisan voters, non MAGA people who are basically reluctant or nonvoters, to really build up enough of his numbers. And so it was very important to him that they be confirmed. And watching Bill Cassidy, a serious man, senator from Louisiana, a doctor, struggle with that vote, knowing that RFK Jr has really promoted quack science and conspiracies for a long time. That he's anti-vaccine... Bill Cassidy's on the fence... was really, you could really see him turning himself into a pretzel and he ends up supporting him and now is going to call him before his committee to talk about all the firings and he's upset and concerned."

Trump still gets his immigrants to be gardeners at Mar-a-Lago on the H-2B visa and Musk still gets people to work at Tesla on H-1B visas? Probably. Last time around the Trump administration didn't really focus hard on cracking down on H-1Bs. They made some proposed changes. The Biden administration has put some changes in effect too. There is bipartisan agreement that the H-1B program needs some changes, though there are obviously strong disagreements about what those actual changes are, but we will likely see some form of regulation aiming to crack down on third-party use of H-1B visas, so people who just are hired as contractors on H-1B visas and then farmed out to various different sites where then they don't have to be paid at the same wages at the places they're working at. We have big consulting companies like Tata Consulting getting some of the highest number of H-1B visas. That is something that I expect them to try to crack down on a little bit. That's another program where there is still strong enough business support for the visa that it will probably remain in effect even if there're some minor changes. I should let you go soon. You've been very generous with your time, and this is such a complicated-but so interesting actually- to get at."

But you get into focus groups with these young people, and our friend, Sarah Longwell, who does such brilliant work, will probably attest to this, they have real concerns about their own economic viability. So I would contrast what Biden is doing, and will do, with what Trump has done, and will do, on things that very much affect people's lives, and I would not count on the shock and dismay of people over the fact that the guy's under 91 criminal indictments, or that he engineered an insurrection, and so on, I think you're going to get that for free, but it's not enough to win. Our friend, Doug Sosnik, in one of these conversations said the alarm bells really went off for him, and in fact, this is when Trump really took the lead, about September, October, slightly, in the polls, when voters started saying that, retrospectively, they felt that they had done much better personally, economically- Yes, yes. ...in the Trump administration than Biden. And since, as you said at the beginning, it's two incumbents, most recent president and the current president, it's a tough uphill slog, it seems to me, if they're looking at these two presidencies, they're not looking, unlike with Romney and the current presidency- Right. ...and someone who, if he were successful, would define himself as bringing about a brighter future, but you succeeded in defining him as threatening a brighter future."

And by the way, most of those people describe policies which are sort of Reaganites and I guess reflect their own preferences, but I don't think they really reflect Trump's. But even those people have a hard time saying that, well, Trump in the end would really stick to supporting Ukraine and standing up to Russia. So I think the range of variation on that issue is greatest. There may be, and we can perhaps talk about them, there may be differences that would emerge on those other issues on China and on the Middle East, but Russia-Ukraine, it seems pretty stark. And Trump has not been doing or saying anything to suggest otherwise. I mean, on many issues where he seems to sense that there may be strong opposition to positions that he's taken, he's sort of fudged it and pulled back, but he hasn't really done that on Russia-Ukraine. I haven't read the full transcript of his encounter with Zelensky, but people are pointing to this or some people are pointing to this, ""Well, they met and it was very cordial, and how can you say that Trump would be hostile to Ukraine?"" But if you read at least the portions of the transcript I saw, the reason he likes Zelensky now, he says, is Zelensky really could have stuck it to him during the first impeachment investigation by saying that he felt pressured."

But you think if we have this conversation in March and it's getting warmer again, we'll have come through the winter okay, the German government will have come through okay, the German public will have held, the winter stock will have held, so forth? I think so. Yes. I mean, Germany's been refilling its energy stocks, as you know. I think they're up, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think they're up to about 80% of gas storage for winter now. So they're getting ready, which is normally I think they'd be at about 40, 50% at this point in the year. So they're filling up very quickly. They're making sure they've got the supplies in. I mean, Russia is still playing. But the gas supply, as you know, Nord Stream 1, that gas pipeline that connects Russia to Germany is apparently going through another few days of maintenance, which seems realistically to be an excuse for Russia to sort of play with the gas supply."

And I think the upside of getting more under-30, more non-whites, particularly Blacks, excited is considerably better than the downside is, is that some of the older voters who Biden, may not vote or back off a little bit, but that's an exchange I'd be happy to make. And also if they were already for Biden, I kind of doubt that they'd desert a Harris ticket. I don't think so. I know if they already had gone to Trump, which of course many of them have, maybe Biden could have gotten a couple more back, which Harris won't get. But yeah, I'm inclined to think that she... And I suppose Walz, I mean I wasn't crazy about that pick, but I think you could argue he helps with that demographic actually, right?

You've committed a felony reentry after removal, and you could potentially be sent to prison and you can be redeported very quickly. If you get expelled back to Mexico, on the other hand, you could just turn around and try again and try again and try again and try again. When Title 42 was in effect, some estimates are as high as one in three people caught crossing the border were on their second or higher failed attempt. And you had a lot of people who were just sent back to Mexico repeatedly as part of the program who would just make it in on their third, fourth, fifth, sixth try. So basically, to maybe conclude here on the border, when Trump says, ""I'm going to close the border,"" not sure if he's literally said that, but he pretty much says that, he could be pretty close. Am I right? He could come pretty close to closing the border or shutting the border down. Yeah, so he can legally find ways to make it very difficult for any migrants to be allowed into the United States. But as we saw with Title 42 the first time around, even if you sign an order saying not a single person should be allowed into the United States because of COVID, that doesn't actually mean that not a single person will be able to enter the United States and remain here."
3g_LXhzZdsK,7827,A.B. Stoddard,"So give me your general take on all this. And so you talk to a lot of those people and you're in touch with them. First, it is strange because we've seen the presidency age people, most recently George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and we didn't really see it age Trump too much. And I agree with you that he really didn't look like he'd aged much. I don't think he looked like he aged when he was at the CNN Town Hall. And I don't know if that's what orange makeup does for you, but he didn't look the way that when you look back at clips from three years before when you're dealing with someone in their second half of their seventies, whatever, you usually notice it, so he definitely seems like he's very vital. He wasn't even sniffing, I don't think he was on his little Diet Coke medicines that he takes, but Joe Biden has visibly aged in office. And before I start on all this, I always like to preface it by saying, it's not that Joe Biden is not worth voting for, obviously he is, and Trump is unacceptable. It's just that I still remain completely stunned that he decided to run again. I don't know that he's going to make it a year and a half on the campaign trail to sign up for another four years and tell us that he can lead the free world until January of 2029."
ZkWchWrfWZC,8882,James Carville,"Convention begins the 15th. Vance has picked the 15th. Trump gives a speech on the Thursday, Biden out on the Sunday, and people as late as that Wednesday, Thursday, I think I did [David Axelrod and Mike Murphy], we were all slightly down on the dumps that the move to persuade President Biden to step aside, which we've all been involved in, was not going to succeed. I actually was a little more optimistic, but people were... So to be fair to them, maybe they just assumed that Biden was going to be stubborn and Pelosi had no more cards to play and they could just count on that. I don't know. What do you think? That's why The Bulwark exists. Or Tim Alberta, that's why Tim exists. I don't know, but certainly, it was in early July, I said, President Biden will not be up for reelection in 2024. Did I have inside information? No, but if you go in the New York Times and you say something in the first sentence of an op-ed, you got to have a lot of confidence in your thought process. And I did. I didn't think it was a way... At the end of the day when he snapped at Jason Crowe, I knew it was... And I said, ""That's not who he is."" And Jason Crow is... if there's anything that modern Democratic Party ought to be about, it should be Jason Crow."
5z3oCxPAIFJ,5836,Tim Snyder,"But it's a smaller gulag, and it's a country which has given up on this total vision of the future. But she's writing about Stalinism. Likewise as you say with fascism, she's writing about Hitler's Germany. What she says about propaganda narratives, and the way that they fold all of reality into one big lie, that's much more true of Nazi Germany than it is of fascists in Romania or even fascists in Italy. I think your point about the pluralism, as it were, of fascism, the plurality of fascism is really important. Fascism is built to fit each national tradition. It takes the national and turns it into the irrational, and therefore it's going to look different in each case. Also, because it's not built around a party. Of course individuals matter in the communist tradition as well, but in the fascist tradition, it really is the individual who sets the tone and is supposed to set the tone. It's the leader, the strong man. Fascism is supposed to be different, and it is in fact different. That leads us to these debates, which I think you've just kind of cut through where people say, ""Well, is it really fascism? Because let me give you a list of 11 things, and maybe it only meets..."" That misses the point, because fascism isn't really about being rational, it's about being irrational."
h9SCwFgVHkZ,9927,Mark Esper,"That's where it got really tricky with President Trump. You never knew who was going in before you or after you and saying, ""Hey, that's wrong,"" or, ""He's wrong,"" or, ""DOD should do this."" During the final year, it became very explicit that people, the NSC had their own views and were pushing hard to implement them despite what Defense or Defense and State were saying, and sometimes they were outlandish ideas. That's what, again, concerns me when we talk about a second Trump term is not just who will he put at the cabinet departments, but who's going to flesh out the NSC? Who's going to flesh out the White House staff? Those people are there all the time in the White House. That Oval Office was like a sieve with people going back and forth talking to the president. That's a problem for any administration because... And Trump of course, was vulnerable to the last person who put a bad idea in his head of moving out with that. It does seem to me, and obviously I've never been a fan of his, but early on, he must have had a sense maybe more in 2017, 2019, more in 2019, as you've said, though, than 2020, that he doesn't know everything. He does need some professionals around him."
dL4nu0hTmBA,8227,Mark Esper,"But it runs well to the other side of this argument, which is serious [inaudible], it needs pretty big reform, it's very slow to change, it procures weapons that would've been useful 15 years ago, it's hard to shake things up. What's the sort of balance of truth between those two polls? Yeah, look, the answer in some ways is both. Look, it's all staffed by great people, both military and civilian alike. They're all committed, they spend long hours at the job and do some extraordinary things. But when you go back a step to what we were just talking about, because there are so many stakeholders, there are offices covering each one of those stakeholders and their issues. So my staff, my office of the Secretary of Defense staff was numbered in the 1000s. But you need that type of process, that kind of staff to make sure that you've checked every box, answered any question. And I think generally they produce very good options and solutions, but because they're so thorough and it's so big, it takes time, which is good when you're thinking about long- term important decisions that you have time to think about. But if it's something, if you're in a crisis or you need speed, it's not as adept at that. And so in some ways, we're too slow."
mTWgw7n6kw9,8495,James Carville,"Yeah, it all happened. That would be something if on June 27th Biden says what you just said, that would be a memorable moment in American presidential politics. Yeah, like I say, the Republicans have, I mean, first of all, your group, which is can't say enough good about the way that y'all understand the threat ahead and let's don't whine and complain. Let's just try to get this threat dealt with. And then we can deal with something else four years from now. And as again, you have these one-fifth to one-fourth of Republican primary voters is just obstinate about not voting for Trump, and that's a lot. Then on the Democratic side, our biggest weaknesses are, first of all the ages, but you can't do a thing about that. It's really tepid numbers among under-thirty and really tepid numbers with Blacks and a lot of it driven by males. Yeah, there's no obvious fix for some of that, but I think your point, just say a little more about the MAGA extremism point. I think that was really true in 2022 when Republican Voters Against Trump, we did a lot against Mastriano in Pennsylvania and other extreme MAGA candidates. And the extremism MAGA message worked. We didn't really talk about Trump much in those races, and Shapiro won by [inaudible] and Shapiro didn't and Whitmer didn't and they won by 15 and 10 points in swing states."
GiwFJYb9aqm,5579,Larry Summers,"And so I think there's a bit more insulation that is built into the system than these very personal discussions about chairs of the Fed would suggest. Look, I have said something on the subject of the dollar and things international, that I think that the general kinds of views that I've expressed continue to feel right to me, but in a different way than I used to say. I think the first thing to say is that the dollar is pretty fortunate [compared to] its alternatives. Europe's a museum in some ways, Japan's a nursing home, China's a jail, and Bitcoin's an experiment. So as we think about the role of the dollar, it's important to remember that the alternatives are not immensely attractive. That's part of the reason why gold has gone up so rapidly, because if you want to get out of the dollar, what do you want to get into? I think the other point is, and this is maybe the more fundamental point, I have felt that it is not that it is impossible that the dollar will cease to be a reserve currency. But if it does, it will be in circumstances where that's the least of our problems. And the example is the loss of the British pound status as a reserve currency in the mid-1950s, particularly after Suez."
Ux6Bd3P8-Ju,16566,Anne Applebaum,"So there's been a kind of sea change there as well. France is more complicated, partly because the... France also has a big pro-Russian party, and that was Marine Le Pen's-it's changed its name several times-but Marine Le Pen's French far-right party. Actually, at the start of the war three years ago, she changed her rhetoric somewhat because public opinion went very anti-Russian and she doesn't use the same language. She actually had funding from Russia in the past. So it was not even very subtle. But she also became more cautious about supporting Putin and so on. Certainly Macron remains somebody who feels burned by Putin. He tried to talk to Putin, Putin made fun of him, made him look like an idiot. And there's a strong feeling that security of France also is security of... Ukraine is part of French security as well. I mean, I don't know. In the case of France, I don't know whether that will last the next presidential election, but that's only two or three years from now. So I mean, there's time. Also, France has been talking about becoming independent of the United States for a long time. This is the moment that some people in France have been waiting for. So, I don't know. There's a slightly different story in each one of those three countries, but right now anyway given who's currently in charge, I think their feelings about this are pretty solid."
Sw2VHMt8WGP,3306,Eric Edelman,"But anyway, I think you're right. Yeah, that is the shakedown side. Well, say a word more about that though. Why would the Qatari, why would they be so eager to have Trump's backing or Trump's goodwill? Well, there are a variety of reasons. First, the United States has been the protector of the Gulf States really since the 1960s, early 1970s really. When the Brits decided to remove their defense force from east of Suez in the late 1960s, the United States de facto became the kind of protector of the Gulf States. And that relationship has developed over time and includes, of course, the fact that the Qataris now host a major US Air Force base, Al Udeid, which is also CENTCOM forward. It's CENTCOM's major base in theater. And it's, as a result, played a pretty big role in operations both in Iraq and Afghanistan over the years, continues to play an important role for the US, provides Qatar with the potential protection against Iran- although they themselves have been very interested in mending fences with Iran or maintaining good relations with Iran traditionally so they got all their bases covered. And it also allows them to, because of the hold that they have on us through the base and relations with presidents like the one they want to have with President Trump, it allows them to also do things like host Al Jazeera , which stirs up lots of trouble in the region against other Arab states, moderate states."
IKks56E4LtW,6336,Tom Tugendhat,"And so when you mentioned President Zelensky again, I feel like he got a huge amount of attention, deservedly, in the first two or three months, and now it's become sort of more routine, but I feel like people haven't quite appreciated what he did, and maybe I'm... I mean, is it not... You're a student of political leadership, and I mean, is it not a pretty extraordinary example for us, and are there... Would you say a word about if I'm right, are there... What lessons do you take from it? Well, look. You don't need me to tell you, there is a long history of leaders of countries who, when the country comes under pressure, they jump on the first plane out with their families and a couple of million dollars, and are never seen again. I mean, the most recent example is Ashraf Ghani, the one-time president of Afghanistan, who basically fled before a Taliban army that, much weaker than the Russian army that faced Zelensky, and Zelensky didn't run. You know, Zelensky would very reasonably have been terrified that his family were going to be killed, and he himself would have been killed, you know? We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know?"
IjzKm51bhXG,6872,AB Stoddard,"And I do not expect for Republicans in Congress to come out and say, ""This is not the way we do things in this country."" I just don't. I have no hope- No, fair enough. ...because of the things that they've looked away from. So I hope the Treaty Organization is enough to compel them to be brave here and there, and that's important. But in terms of what he's doing here domestically, I just don't see any opposition from them. You're probably right though the judges... there is a little bit of a catch 22. If the judges are strong and the Democrats are strong, then maybe some Republicans decide at some point, or even if they don't decide, maybe they can hold off a lot of things just for the sake of the country, but we can have that discussion. We will have to resume this. This is very, very interesting though. Very, not entirely cheerful, I mean, but hardheaded. No, it's really important to have this kind of serious look at what's happen. I do think still for everything that we've had now for the first two and a half months of the Trump administration, Trump's second term, people are not facing what's happened so far and what's likely to happen. There's a lot of sense-I'll just close by asking you to react to this-a lot of sense of, oh, that's really been crazy, but now it's going to subside and it's going to kind of be normal."
r9D3V3UGMqa,13383,Anne Applebaum,"And that was supposed to be the red line that they couldn't tolerate. I don't see a lot of... I mean, you can understand because running actually Citibank right now, maybe you can't think, you can't afford to take on Trump. That's itself a statement about capitalism and its limitations and supporting freedom, I would say. But what about former secretaries of the Treasury, former Federal Reserve governors, big shots of all kinds? I am kind of a... We [inaudible] honestly here in the US, I don't know what you've been this summer, it's sort of just taken for granted that they're not going to speak up. I said this on a call this morning with a bunch of people who are anti-Trump. ""Where are you? Where is everyone?"" I mean, they could say maybe they wouldn't have that much effect, but it wouldn't be nothing if three former secretaries of the Treasury said, ""This is totally unacceptable,"" if 10 former Federal Reserve governors appointed by both Republicans and Democrats said it. I mean, crickets, really. Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's partly a phenomenon of people being afraid of being attacked and being doxed, or the fact that MAGA controls a part of the social media, whatever we're calling it, the social media world is part of it."
RxfgaqK5vLY,5089,Larry Summers,"Let me ask you two things that are somewhere between I guess events and trends, but you have great knowledge of and experience in dealing with in government. One is the Fed. I mean it just seems to me from a common sense and the other, just forecast, I'm very curious about the international side of all this, which I think maybe is a little under-covered compared to the ... We are here interested in the US, which is understandable, but it is a global economy and obviously they're real international repercussions and they get a chance to make decisions as well. But on the Fed, just from a commonsense point of view, it just seems inflation is probably not going down. Tariffs are inflationary, if I'm not mistaken, and the deficit is not going down. So the Fed presumably will be under pressure not to maybe to tighten ... If not tighten, at least not loosen. On the other hand, if the economy slows, which also seems quite possible, they'll be under pressure to loosen. So what does the Fed do? How worried are you about Fed independence, which I think has been, don't you think, pretty important in allowing us to be the reserve currency at a place where people were happy to come and invest and also to hold dollars in various forms despite the deficits."
GwZfveZLC1D,8708,James Carville,"Yeah, that sounds right to me. It seems to me though that, I mean the Biden campaign to come back to the campaign for a minute, or even the outside groups, they have a tendency to think, okay, well the guilty thing will explain itself. Whereas I think they really need to be ready to just do a massive effort to plaster the phrase convicted felon on Trump's forehead because it will affect maybe some 2%, 3%, 4% of those Republicans, give them a permission structure to stay home. Maybe for some of them to vote for Biden, I don't know, but I worry that they think that the news explains itself. You know what I mean? And okay, guilty verdict, that's done. Let's move on. The question is how does Biden address Trump in debate? Former President Trump and future inmate. I think so much of the Biden campaign is spent getting Biden in the right mood and to do a few things. I think it's probably a lot harder than we believe over there. They have to be very, very careful how he's deployed and they have to husband him pretty closely. And I can't fault them for that, but yes sir, how are you going to address him? Yeah, that's a good point. But in the meantime, you can use paid media and stuff to really remind people."
a3LfTvA9UsM,3609,Doug Sosnik,"The first is that people remember their economic situation in 2019 before Covid was in a much better position than it is now. And remember that we've gone through the biggest, highest rate of inflation in our country since the early 1980s. And majority of Americans were not either alive or were too young to remember what it was like in the early 1980s. So this is the first experience that a majority of Americans have ever had with inflation. And inflation's like no other economic downturn in terms of the psychological impact that it has on people. And I think that even though the rate of inflation has gone down, the prices haven't gone down and people are still feeling the aftershocks of an incredible period of prices going up. And until recently, wages did not keep pace with that. Particularly food prices that are up twenty-five percent more than they were in 2019. And all goods and services are up 19% more compared to 2019. I think the second problem is one of expectations that were set by Biden when he became president, that the adults were back in charge and that we were going to have calmness. I think if you asked me anything about single issue why Trump lost in 2020, and I think the country felt exhausted from him and just didn't really have the stomach and appetite for four more years of chaos."
n8Yv47kw1UZ,2127,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And you had literally ICE at one point told people, ""We're so full up in New York, your check-in date is 2031."" And you also had people sleeping on the sidewalk outside of ICE's offices in hopes that they would be able to check in that day. And some people would still at the end of the line make it in and be told by ICE, ""Sorry, we've just run out of capacity for the day. You'll have to come back later."" And that gives you some sense of how ICE internally was impacted by the situation at the border. This was true under Trump's first term as well, I want to emphasize. In Trump's first term, 2017 to 2018, internal enforcement ramps up significantly, deportations rise. 2018 to 2019, deportations drop. And that's because they too had a border crisis. They too had to divert internal ICE resources away from internal enforcement to the border. And this is the ways in which these two interact with each other. This does get us to funding, I suppose, which I cut you off on before, but it's very important. So it does sound like they're going to need to go to Congress or want to go to Congress and get tens of billions of dollars to just increase funding to do at least, even if they don't go all the way to Steve Miller land, to do what they want to do and say they want to do and presumably do really want to do in terms of both internal action and the border, right?"
GOLOOwzNQXF,7397,Jack Goldsmith,"It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime. It may be that previous Justice Departments have overreached in indicting people for things or investigating people for things, but there's at least been the claim that there's an actual statute somewhere in the, what's it called, the code of whatever it's called, the legal code. UC Code, yeah. Yeah. There's like Statue 1274, which someone violated. Well, we don't usually... Let me just back. Yes, first of all, I wasn't surprised, because he did that all throughout his first term. He did it all throughout the campaign. So the thing that surprised me last Sunday was the moderating part, not the part about people needing to go to jail. Yeah, we don't typically have presidents talking about who should go to jail. Biden actually did once in violating norms during his term and said some other things he shouldn't have said. But typically, presidents don't even talk about this stuff. And typically, law enforcement doesn't talk about people going to jail. They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump."
a1of0QMhpvH,6762,Jack Goldsmith,"Yeah. We're speaking, as you say, just a month after the Biden pardon of his son and what, six weeks before very likely... Not just likely. He said he is going to do it, pardon of January 6th, people who invaded or stormed the Capitol or intruded on the capitol, however you want to say it. So yeah, it's certainly a live issue. I guess it makes the point that you just alluded to, maybe you could develop a bit, though. It's partly a matter of these guardrails being fortified, made intelligent, check abuse, but also allow for presidential leadership and a strong executive and so forth. It's partly the internal thinking and sort of internal checks of the presidents and his team themselves. It can't all be done by Congress doing A, or the Supreme Court doing B. This is one of the most important things that we have learned since 2017, and that is... I'll zoom out and then I'll come back into the pardoning power. Okay. That so many effective constraints on the presidency were grounded in self-understandings by the president, the character of the president, the ultimate reasonableness of the president, and that checked... Bill Clinton, when he did his pardons at the end of his term, he knew he was doing wrong, and he did it anyway, but there was this sense that you're not supposed to do that, and that kind of called norms or expectations of the office or self-constraint by presidents not to abuse the office, it's a really important constraint on the presidency."
ShOoFQ_ju3k,7887,Robert Kagan,"And the Depression was a circumstance. World War II was a circumstance. Neither of those events were necessarily inevitable, and they really did lead to the huge burst of liberalism that was the second half of the 20th century. And it precisely is what has set off this movement that we're seeing in MAGA today. They are reacting in a sense to 60, 70 years of liberal triumph and liberal dominance. Now they think that they're responding to an excess of liberalism, but in fact they're just responding to the founders' principles playing themselves out increasingly over time. And, again, that's a fundamental, I think, misunderstanding that many conservatives have. They think that the courts were being creative and creating new rights, et cetera, when what the court was doing was recognizing areas of discrimination in ways and with groups that people hadn't thought of before, but which nevertheless were being discriminated against, whether it was women, or gays, or obviously Blacks, people knew, were being discriminated against. But as these rights have been discovered and acknowledged increasingly those forces of traditionalism in our country have increasingly felt hemmed in and oppressed. And you can read, then you can feel it in reading someone like Deneen who talks about liberal totalitarianism, et cetera. But there is a great feeling that these people feel oppressed by liberalism."
sYpsDnVs4S4,9404,Mark Esper,"Hi there. I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined today by Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense from 2019 to 2020. Before that, Secretary of the Army, way before that, West Point graduate, a combat veteran of the first Gulf War and infantry officer, distinguished career. And this is when we got to know each other, Mark. You were in the executive branch, you were on the senior positions on the Hill, private sector, and then you ended up as Secretary of the Army and Secretary of Defense under President Trump and served honorably. We can get back to that there, and you were relieved of your duties there right after the election, which for me was a huge alarm bell. Honestly, I thought, ""My God, if President is removing Mark Esper, nothing good is going to happen at the Defense Department for those final two months."" But anyway- And you know you have a good story there too. Yeah, I do. Right? I was in a simulation in the summer of 2020, what could go wrong after election day? And I said... I was playing Trump, President Trump, and I said, ""I think I'll just remove my Secretary of Defense. I think I also remove Bill Barr just to have those two agencies a little more under my direct control without the kinds of limits that you and Bill Barr would... the kinds of things you would not do that he might want to do."" And everyone said on... this was on Zoom, it was during the pandemic."
VJOYssSeNSg,2487,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And the best example of this is something called the No Blank Spaces policy from the first time. The No Blank Spaces policy was a policy where when you submitted an application for asylum or for what's known as a U visa (it's a visa for people who've been victims of serious crimes in the United States and cooperated with police), what they said is, ""If you do not write N/A in every single blank box on the form, including the totally irrelevant blank boxes, we will automatically reject your application and send it back to you and make you refile it."" So that would mean, for example, if you had no middle name, your name was John Smith and you didn't write N/A in the middle name column, they would send it back. If you had one child and the physical application form has four blank boxes for you to put your children and you didn't write N/A in the other three boxes, your application would be automatically rejected. Apart from the drama of saying, ""No one from Gaza, no one from Afghanistan, no terrorists, no this, no that, no people who are going to be leeches on the system or criminals,"" so it really could change our legal immigration policy. But in absolute numbers, I mean, how big does that end up being?"
fn7-32EZUiR,7159,Robert Kagan,"And the anti-liberalism is primarily a rejection of liberalism's leveling quality. It is destructive of hierarchies, of all hierarchies, including family hierarchies. And it's destructive of tradition. And I think a lot of people are trying to hold onto traditions that are gradually undermined in a liberal system. Now, they can be replaced by other traditions. The United States doesn't prevent people from, obviously, worshiping as they choose, unlike, for instance, the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution, which really was very hostile and sought to eradicate religion from their society. That's not the American approach. But if people want to have a traditional Christian life, and not only for themselves but in society at large, and that is what a lot of Americans want, that is fundamentally contrary to what the founders intended and contrary to liberalism as the founders established it. So it's a modern populist anti-liberalism. I don't even like to call it populist because that implies that it's mostly just your average person. And populism is always paired versus elitism. But of course, there are elites on both sides of this debate. In what way is Donald Trump not an elite? In what way is Steve Bannon not an elite? Populism also suggests that a lot of it is economic. At least traditionally in American history, populist movements have sought, basically, fundamentally economic goals."
Aofc3juRq97,6227,Tim Snyder,"And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud. And then from that we reason to, ""they're going to flee."" And I think it's that deep unspoken thing which was basically mistaken. And that's where maybe I had an edge over other people because I studied the place. In the last 30 years, Ukrainian civil society has become more and more active and self-aware. And this is relevant for Americans too, successful at defending and pushing democracy forward because democracy doesn't just happen as we like to think. It unhappens, democracy naturally unhappens, you have to make democracy happen. And Ukrainian civil society step by step has managed to not only sustain, but make democracy a little bit less imperfect over time. And it's that same civil society then, which is behind the army, which is fighting the war. And it's that same state, which has gotten- you know, it's not perfect, but it's gotten better and better over time rather than worse and worse, which is fighting this war. And then of course, I think they were fortunate with their leadership too. I mean, it's kind of an argument for democracy that somebody as improbable as Zelensky would win an election."

You add to that though, people who are purposely powerful people or powerful governments, purposely using that for political purposes, political in a broad sense as well as actual elections. But I mean broader social and political purposes. That becomes very powerful. And it isn't quite even. I mean, I'm not saying people on the other side shouldn't therefore study this and think about, ""Well, how do I counter that?"" But just as you were saying exactly, I mean by nature of the algorithm and of what we're talking about I guess, the extremists, the conspiracy theorists, the alarmists, are going to have an advantage over the sober, ""Well, actually, it's complicated. And yeah, of course everything has a tiny risk, but it's a hugely positive thing on nets."" Whatever the... It's just, Trump and Elon Musk and Roger Stone, are going to have an advantage over Kamala Harris and some earnest liberal who believes that we should expand healthcare some. I mean, right? And it'll be true with the left too. I mean, you could have Islamists- RENÉE DIRESTA: Oh, the left is so bad at this. I can go on about that forever."
yvuD-hxpCp-,5430,Tom Tugendhat,"It's not. If we get it right, not only do we both prosper in economic terms, but we both prosper in the sense that we defend our own liberty more deeply. And when we bring in countries, and I'll use the same two just as examples, Nigeria and Indonesia, we're not just helping three, 400 million people in Nigeria and similar, maybe more in Indonesia to prosper, we're actually ensuring that the principles of the rule of law, the principles of personal freedom, the principles of liberty that we value are embedded more deeply in other parts of the world and that it effectively extends the bounds of freedom and guards the British and American people more strongly. And that's well said. I'm sure you will continue to say that and say it even more visibly and across borders, because I think Putin's invasion and the reaction to it has done a lot of well-earned damage, in my view, to a kind of America first demagoguery here in the US. On the other hand, I would say the Biden administration hasn't... They've got a lot of other things to worry about, though they've behaved quite well in this crisis. They haven't really articulated what you just articulated. And in fact, on some issues, because of politics and other things, they haven't been as forward-leading, I would say, on trade at all."
Se-YzFtH9ML,6994,A.B. Stoddard,"And there's a lot of evidence that the 2016 voters who voted third, fourth party, they didn't have that chance in 2020, and Biden won two-thirds of them and it probably was key to his margin in some of those really close states. So I feel like the chances of a semi-credible, younger-looking, now that doesn't quite include Manchin so maybe he's not the right person for this, third party fusion-ish candidacy. Time for change, get beyond the polarization, we can't have these two old guys again, ridiculous, what does that ever work, we deserve a better choice. I feel like that gets a little more momentum if it's Biden versus Trump as opposed to Whitmer or Shapiro or Warnock or whoever you want, Buttigieg and a million other people against Trump. And that probably takes votes ultimately from Biden. It's dismissed by the pros because the pros know that these third parties never go anywhere. They never go anywhere, but they did actually affect the results of the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. So that's two of the last, what, six or something like that. So it's not nothing. I don't know. I get the sense just talking to people, and I include myself in this criticism, that we know it's ultimately a two-party race. We think it's probably going to be Biden versus Trump."
KHqs31PdBwG,8777,Mark Esper,"But the day usually runs pretty long. I used to try and wrap up by 6:00 PM because I knew that I could stay longer, but there were hundreds of people waiting for me to leave that had to do the cleanup work, the administrative stuff after I left. I learned that years earlier as a captain on the Army staff at the Pentagon. And so I tried to get out of there every day by 6:00. I'd carry a big bag of work home, I'd get home, eat dinner, and I would read and write and sign memos for the next two hours. So it was a long day and it would extend it to the weekends. But look, that's the nature of public service. I'm sure Lloyd Austin is going through that now, and my predecessors did also. You throw on top of that foreign travel, because a big part of the Secretary of Defense's job, unlike the service secretaries, which I was Secretary of the Army, is there's a big foreign policy dynamic. And that means going over it and meeting not just your counterparts in countries, but also the heads of state, the prime ministers. And so that was a big part of the job that often gets overlooked. And you really have to balance that out because we do have a Secretary of State who that's his primary job, exclusive job."
UN6F_cAcd7b,7501,James Carville,"That's one of my favorite arguments that I got. I get this a lot. I like to do kind of right-wing media, unlike most people because it keeps me... It's good when you... In old age, they tell you to do these, you should play bridge and you should do... I go on there. They call it the Democratic Party, but it's Anti-Democrat. I said if anybody felt... If some democratic primary vote in Indiana is mad that their vote for Biden wouldn't count, I hadn't heard from him. If some donor said, ""Well, there's actually one donor."" ""Well, good. Give him his money back."" Okay, fine. The idea that... And it's always been a fascinating thing. The Republicans used to love to call us the Democrat Party. Right. I think I told the story but I'll repeat because it was good. It was Clayton Yeutter, who was the chairman of the RNC, was the first who called it the Democratic Party. And they asked him why. And he said, ""Well, a political party has a right to be called what it wants to be called,"" which seemed like a kind of reasonable thing that a polite guy from Nebraska would say. I mean, you call people what you want, but that argument is beyond silly. But it is interesting, they never got a vote."
qMvgBiEj9yF,3467,Doug Sosnik,"The other five states are all kind of in the middle of education levels. So that in most states you have 40 states right now in which one party controls the governorship and the legislature, and it's all based on whether or not they're highly educated or low levels of education. And so what makes these states unique is the fact that they don't skew too much one way or the other on education levels. So you've got this issue of abortion, which is a huge issue if it's, quote, unquote, ""on the ballot,"" but is less of an issue if people in the community don't feel threatened by it. And so right now, again, just focusing on these six states, Arizona is going to have abortion on the ballot in November, and Nevada is quite possibly going to have it. There's some other states, but they're not part of the six. But if you take the three Midwestern states in the three sort of Sunbelt states, the Sunbelt states I think are more favorable in general to Trump and the Republicans for three reasons. One is from an economic standpoint; I think they feel more pinched by what's been going on and remember more fondly 2019 with an economy under Trump. The second is, if you look at the polling particularly of swing voters, is the sense that Democrats are just spending way too much money in government, and that's a big part of the problem."
4GQD8GNxGL2,7109,Aaron Friedberg,"That doesn't seem to have happened directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we're going to see this problem grow and take different forms, but it isn't going to go away. There will continue to be terrorism, terrorist attacks on targets in the region and outside the region, conceivably. Yuck. Meanwhile, the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years is going ahead. It's not ceased or even diminished in intensity, really. Yes. And I gather the Russians are slowly, slowly making progress. Ukraine has conducted this counteroffensive, which continues into Russian territory. But there's no sign there of any kind of decisive outcome in either direction. I guess there was hope some time ago that the Ukrainian forces might be able to roll back the Russians. And I think, for the most part, people have given up on this thought, at least for the foreseeable future. So is this headed for some kind of a stalemate? What might break the stalemate? To what extent would the United States and others support Ukraine in taking action that could conceivably have that effect, even at the risk of escalation with Russia? So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons."
VCpE621iC8C,7849,Robert Kagan,"Do Irish remember that they used to be in the 19th century depicted as ape-like creatures with a bottle of rum in their hands? Or how Italians were treated in America for many decades, but now they consider themselves white, and so they're willing to tolerate a white nationalist movement in the Republican Party as we see. I want to come back to the elites for a minute. I was struck in reading your account of the twenties, and I myself think this is true today that the elite side of MAGA, let's just say, or Trumpism, is underrated. The Wall Street Journal editorial page apologists, the importance of that is underrated compared to the Fox News screaming and yelling. Both are necessary I suppose, a movement consists of both, almost always. So I was just struck in the book you quote, so you remind us/me that Henry Ford in 1920 published a book The World's Foremost Problem . I think that was a pamphlet or a book, I think it was an actual book. It was a series of pamphlets I think, yeah. Or series of pamphlets, yeah, wonderful. Yeah. Henry Ford was not a tribute. He was the most famous businessman, one of the 10 most famous businessmen in America. He was the great champion of modern... obviously the automobile and of paying people more so they could buy the automobile."

And the majority of senators voted to confirm him. How can you say that he's just a crackpot? And then if you're in the middle and you're not sure, maybe there is something messed up with our food and too much sugar and whatever artificial ingredients. But on the other hand, some of the stuff sounds a little wacky. But I guess the Senate confirmed him, so maybe there's more to what he's been saying than I thought. I do think it affects both the true believers, as it were, and the in between people. And this is where the political power really magnifies the effect of the- RENÉE DIRESTA: Exactly. So that's where we are now. So that acceleration, now there's the capacity to act, to drive policy and to make decisions that impact families and children based on those theories. That's not great. Let me ask you this, just one final maybe question, not final question, but the final theme of this. So internationally, the EU has taken an attitude of greater regulation, I guess is the way to say it. You should maybe explain that a little bit. Has it mattered much, or has it worked, or is it a model for us, or do we have to rethink things from the ground up?"
QhXqLctcn1q,14865,Anne Applebaum,"We've seen that obviously, or try to bribe people to get good regulations for your company. But that is, I think, qualitatively different really from this level of... And of course, turning the whole US government in a sense, into a place where the people can bid for access and for favors. And then I do think there too, combined with the politicization and weaponization of the Justice Department, of the intelligence agencies, of the FBI, parts of DOD, certainly DHS, that's again, something we've never seen, I think in this way. That is, I don't know, you studied Putin a lot, I mean, isn't it, not to... We're not going to, forbid, become like Russia or something in the next few years, but that really is Putin-esque, isn't it? It really is. I mean, it's happened in many different places. You could look at Turkey, you could look at Venezuela, you could look... It's not necessarily a right-wing thing, by the way. But I mean the taking over of the institutions of the state, making civil servants personally loyal to the President and not to the state or to the country, firing intelligence officers who produce material that the President doesn't like. And this happened a few days ago. Using the FBI or its equivalents to conduct investigations into the president's personal enemies."
wswM9cU5JEl,16167,Anne Applebaum,"It's much more eloquent than I just said it. And he meant it, I think. And he did a lot of things that really... We think of him as preserving the Union and the constitution, which is true, but also huge amount, of course, leaving aside the Emancipation Proclamation and winning the war. But I mean, many, many things he did were not... It was a kind of refounding of the republic, and I don't want to get too rhetorical or whatever, but one almost thinks that there has to be a little more thinking, I guess the way I would put it. It's a tricky thing. Jonathan Last made this point, I'll close by asking you this, the other day, which is it's tricky at one at the same time, defend the institutions that has to be defended, even though they're flawed, even though they've messed up in some ways because the alternative is so much worse. So, you have to defend... Justice Department wasn't perfect. The FBI wasn't perfect. The health services weren't perfect, but I mean, compared to what's on offer here, they need to be defended. But you also do have to have a path forward. They can't just be going back to the- No, we can't go back. No, they need to be defended and reimagined."
dY-_33U-HtN,7808,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't think voters are going to go, ""Boy, Joe Biden didn't play six-dimensional chess, and Kevin McCarthy got the better of him."" I think we'll just move on. And it'll just be good for Kevin McCarthy, but not bad for Joe Biden to have averted default. But I do think, and I really hope, I'm really being optimistic on Ukraine. That we're in a situation now, where people got mad at Ron DeSantis in the party about his remarks. Donors left him over those remarks, and he equivocated. And that message from Kevin McCarthy, I thought, was very promising. So I'm hoping that it's very bad for Joe Biden actually going into reelection, I think, if it looks like we are in a quagmire. And that he's not giving Ukraine the ability to win, he's just giving Ukraine the ability to not lose. If that drags on into next year, past the two-year mark, I think that that actually is an electoral liability for him. So I think he's invested in their success, I think the Republicans are going to help out with that, I hope. I don't see that being a big thing. But I'm just focused on Biden and Trump. And I just have this weird feeling that something will intervene. At least one of them will not be on the ticket."
Yp8TH5NrKWF,2857,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That's flagrantly unconstitutional. He can't do that. Obviously- And even he is saying, I think, that he would do it prospectively, presumably, not retroactively. Right? Yeah. Though of course, there's really no legal way that you could make that distinction, say, oh, okay, so the constitution requires you to have birthright citizenship up through January 20, 2025. But after that, no longer it does. So anything that he did there would- Well, an executive order could say that, though. Any executive order would still threaten people. Of course, one of the things we've heard him say, was stop granting passports to people who can't prove that both their parents were US citizens or had legal status when the child was born. Of course, plenty of US citizens need to get a passport who are not being born now. Maybe a 30, 40-year-old who was born to undocumented parents, would that person be denied a passport under this policy? We don't know. And so that... ways in which it could threaten people potentially whose were born decades ago. And it's of course, just to emphasize, it is a crackpot legal theory pushed by John Eastman, primarily. The disgraced and disbarred John Eastman of the 2020 Big Lie efforts to overturn the election. He is the main legal ""scholar,"" and I put ""scholar"" in quotes here, who has argued that the president can do this."
Wbj40gH-vOo,8203,Robert Kagan,"But fascism is the malady of popular government, of a popular era. You're not going to have a dictator claim divine right in most cases. They're not going to establish a monarchy in what has become a popular age, certainly since the early 19th century. Even dictators have to win the allegiance of a certain number of people, especially if they're operating within democracies. And that's what Trump has succeeded in doing. And I think that what makes it fascist is the sort of blind loyalty to an individual leader, almost irrespective of ideology but certainly anti-liberal. Mussolini declared openly that he was opposed to liberalism, he was opposed to democracy. And I think we don't say that as frankly in the United States, but that's here. But yes, there is a peculiar element. America is special, and the thing about America is that it's absolutely tangled up. All these questions are tangled up with the fundamental issue of race. And that is more true in the United States than it is in Europe. Europe has its own historical issues, but in the United States the issue has been race. And the anti-liberalism is primarily a rejection of liberalism's leveling quality. It is destructive of hierarchies, of all hierarchies, including family hierarchies. And it's destructive of tradition. And I think a lot of people are trying to hold onto traditions that are gradually undermined in a liberal system."
idqdnBENIy4,15792,Anne Applebaum,"And it's what happened in Hungary over a number of years. It's what happened in Venezuela. It doesn't have to be a right wing process. It's what Hugo Chavez did. He famously fired 19,000 workers at the state oil company and therefore destroyed the state oil company. So the idea that you have to take control of state institutions and you have to make them work for you personally rather than for the people or the nation as a whole, this is something that every illiberal leader elected and unelected sooner or later thinks they need to do, and I did expect that Trump would do it. I didn't have the imagination to know or to think that you could do it by going into government agencies and becoming the system administrator of the computer systems. Right. So, this piece of it is original to the United States, and this is something that I think Americans should know. This is more radical than anything any European far-right party has ever done. There is no precedent for Musk taking his team of teenage engineers going into the US Treasury and taking charge of the payment system. And nor is there any precedent for Musk personally deciding which programs he likes and dislikes and which ones he wants to freeze. This is not being done by any kind of process."
W8ssUhLkDxG,16777,Anne Applebaum,"They still have huge advantages. But the fact remains that we are more than three years into the war, and the front line is barely moving. I mean, by the standards of wars. It moves a little bit, but the collapse of the front line that people were predicting six months ago never happened, and we're now at the end of the summer. So fighting will slow down as the weather gets worse. In Ukraine's case, the innovation is as they have been invaded and have territory conquered, and they're fighting right there, whereas I don't mean to minimize our achievements in World War II or other countries, Britain, Germany, et cetera, but we weren't partly occupied and weren't being, I believe Britain was, but we weren't being bombed every night and so forth. So I mean it is- No, I mean, actually one of the things that bothers me the most about the way Trump talks about Ukraine is he keeps talking about Ukraine has no cards. There was something he said a couple of days ago about how Ukraine is a small country, it shouldn't have gone to war with a big country. I mean, first of all, who invaded who? But there's this constant refusal to recognize this achievement, the holding the line. It is a smaller country, it is fighting a bigger country."
Kf4R8jUVCMW,9678,James Carville,"He's the only person that's divided... that brought the unite the right and the Palestine liberation, whatever these people call themselves. That was the moment that I said, oh man, this guy can't win no matter what he does. Well, but I think you think he could win. I mean it's maybe slightly less than fifty-fifty. What about the timing? So it's the end of May. We have this debate presumably on June 27th. Is that A, likely to happen in your view and B, is that actually a moment where people might focus in a big way as opposed to one speech here, one speech there kind of thing? So let's take something we know as a fact. Democrats have not lost since Kansas. This has happened. Maybe it has... I think somebody pointed out [inaudible]... Western Nebraska that we were supposed to lose about 23 and lost about seven. All right? So we know that. We know this tribe's voting day. If he's fortunate... I don't think Trump will go to the debate. And I base that on, he'll do anything that's not in his perceived self-interest. And this is one of these things where he could hurt... Biden has a chance to help himself. But let's say that he goes. If I were his debate coach, I would say that I am not outsourcing Supreme Court picks."
41Af8rkVKiv,8927,Robert Kagan,"He's made it very clear. I really don't understand. Too many people do not seem to understand that if Trump wins, there was going to be a bigger target on their backs than they are used to in this America. And from official forces, maybe either federal or tolerated forces at the state and local level with sympathetic governors or mayors obviously, but also the vigilante forces. I mean, you mentioned people not being punished. That's a part of American history obviously, and the kind of collusion you might say of the vigilantes and the law enforcement and official forces. Absolutely. I'm very struck with people have not made enough. I think Amanda Carpenter, who used to be with us at The Bulwark and is now at Protect Democracy, has made this point. Trump says in every speech that he's against qualified immunity for police officers, which I think a lot of people think actually is too much immunity, honestly, in terms of holding them accountable, but whatever. And he's for absolute immunity as he is for himself as president, for police officers, basically. They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments."
h_QdWSGdOEX,3539,David Axelrod,"In terms of motivating voters, getting these choice initiatives on the ballot is really useful. So they're working on that in Nevada, I think in Arizona. There are some other states that are less battleground states where they're working on getting something on the ballot. That will bring younger voters out. The Florida Supreme Court ruled yesterday, they put it on the ballot. I doubt Florida's going to be in play, but it's going to make it more competitive. The other thing about it, Bill, is it's going to force Donald Trump to decide to say publicly whether he supports the- Which he won't say right now. We had a piece in The Bulwark this morning... late last night by Marc Caputo that Trump refused to answer. He's a Florida voter. He's going to be on the ballot, voting presumably in November, and he won't say whether he'll vote for the constitutional amendment preserving abortion rights in Florida or not, which is... I mean, Trump is clever in the sense that he's right, I think to be wary of that issue, and right to try to straddle it and duck it. But a good campaign could make it harder for him to straddle it and duck it. Partly because of DeSantis, he attacked the six-week abortion ban that DeSantis signed, that Supreme Court in Florida affirmed yesterday that is going to have reverberations nationally."
Lf8JnGrB868,5141,Aaron Friedberg,"And then they have to ask themselves, well, what can we do to take care of ourselves? Because they're not just going to give in to their enemies, presumably. Maybe we can get to this, but one of the things that I find frustrating, I guess, about the discussion on foreign policy alone and the comparison between a notional Harris administration and a notional Trump II administration, is that it tends to ignore a whole set of other problematic issues, which arguably are more domestic or internal that would arise I think under a Trump administration, which would raise deep questions about the stability of our political system and of the fragmentation of our society, and that's the foundation on which American power ultimately rests. And I think we have every reason to fear that a second Trump administration would exacerbate those problems and would reinforce the notion that you find, for example, in contemporary Chinese analysis of where the US stands, that we're not exactly a paper tiger. We have many strengths, but we also have these, from their perspective, critical weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and they're almost entirely to do with the state of our society and the state of our political institutions. And I think in many ways they're betting on that, counting on that because power is always relative, and power in the Chinese view is the sum total of all different kinds of capabilities, including those related to the strength of the domestic system."
gRMFn4EuQLl,2507,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And the undocumented population pretty much grew steadily through the 1980s, 1990s, and then 2000s. Then around 2006, 2007, border numbers started dropping for a couple of different reasons. First, the labor market cooled off. The Great Recession caused a massive drop in construction and other industries that were often employing undocumented immigrants. And so with far fewer jobs and the economy going downhill, people didn't have as much of a need to come here. It was much harder to make any money here. And then second, it coincided with a massive growth of border security under the Bush administration. The border patrol doubled in size over the course of a decade, and by 2008, 2009, immigration enforcement was really at the height of its power. And so a lot of people, again, seeing the combination of a massive drop in jobs and a much more difficult process of crossing the border, really stopped coming at the same numbers that we'd seen in the past. And the undocumented population sort of peaked at around 12 million in 2007, and by around 2015, 2016, had dropped down to about 10.5 million. So there actually was... You hear people saying, ""Oh, it's been 11 million for all this time,"" and the answer is not really. It was kind of like it hit 12 million, and then sort of steadily declined through the 11 millions, dropped below 11 million."
H5Rz0QRsCL-,5058,Tom Tugendhat,"And they were created not to replace the nation states. They were created to enable countries that had very often only recently rediscovered their liberty. Countries like France initially didn't join the World Trade Organization in order to be subsumed into a greater hole. They'd just literally fought for their independence against an occupying empire. And I think finding ways in which nation states can work together and have enabling organizations is going to be the real challenge of the next 20, 30 years of our diplomacy. And how the United States, how the UK, how Canada, but also how countries like Nigeria and Indonesia sit within that is going to be hugely defining. Because at the moment, the challenge is, we're either seeing the sort of Putin-style imperial colonialist project, which is what he's trying to do in Ukraine and Georgia, and to a certain extent, in the Baltic states, or we're seeing a form of debt trap diplomacy from China. We've got to respond, and we've got to respond in a different way. And I think the way we respond best is by recognizing, as we do in Ukraine, that actually sovereign people want sovereignty. They want freedom. They want exactly the same things you guys fought for on a couple of occasions against us, and that we fought for in order to protect our own freedoms in the last century."

And then of course, even if we move beyond this, he's going to try to force them to shut the government down again on the government funding fight for September. He wants the confrontation, and he wants to be their leader, and dominate, and push them around. So I'm going to be surprised if he stays out of it. I mean, I think he's going to be, when it gets really tense and there's like some real stuff on the table, if it looks like McCarthy's about to convince his members to support it and it can pass Schumer's Senate, I'm sure Trump's just going to get in there and editorialize. He could be an exacerbating factor, and he could make it very hard for McCarthy. Hard to see why he wouldn't. But I guess stranger things have happened. I mean he's a huge wild card, as you say. I mean, in a way, the best case for Trump is if he gets to scream and yell about how it's a sellout, and then quietly let it go through, not actually put too much pressure on members. Because Trump does not actually want, presumably... In a certain way he wants, I don't know, does he want a crisis?"

But whatever everyone thinks of America First, at least, I suppose, the promise of it would be kind of we stay out of these conflicts. We're not involved. It's a coherent, if not desirable in my view, intellectual construct. But that's not what-you made this point the other day, so just elaborate on it maybe to close-that doesn't seem to be Trump's attitude. He's not just keeping hands off of all these places, he loves being in the mix, it seems like. Plus he has all kinds of commercial interests and personal reasons for liking some countries better than others and some leaders better than others, which he likes to indulge. I don't know. It's striking to me. Well, threatening to intervene in Mexico by bombing drug cartels and things like that. It's- Greenland. It's not really totally coherent at all intellectually. I mean, just to kind of tie off the Ukraine piece of it before going to the broader question. On Ukraine, the problem is that Putin is playing for time. I mean, his losses have been extraordinary and the rate of advance has been really very slow. I mean, they've been advancing but at a snail's pace and mostly dismounted infantry assaults, very hard for them to make up their losses in equipment and much less in personnel."
Dr32HNxk72h,3299,David Axelrod,"You cannot allow this to be a referendum in an environment in which 65% of the country feels like things are on the wrong track. People need to understand this is a choice now. It's not a choice between, as Biden used to say, between him and the Almighty. It's him and the alternative. The alternative is deeply, deeply flawed. I mean, Donald Trump is consumed by his past, his program for the future. Yes, he would like people to feel that it's about the economy and immigration, but it's really about retribution and revenge and his own aggrandizement. He has no space, time or interest in the experience of everyday people or the things that they're going through. He has no sense of empathy. He views everything through the prism of Donald Trump, and that should be a real advantage for Joe Biden and that they should press that through a variety of issues. I don't think any ad they run should be a positive ad. I think they should run nothing but contrast media, potentially negative ads in spots, but they put up an ad today, Bill, about abortion rights. That was a very simple comparative that starts with Trump bragging about being the guy who brought down Roe versus Wade and Biden narrating talking about-which is a good thing-talking about his commitment to abortion rights and his trust in women."
SzISDLbw16r,2621,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So there actually was... You hear people saying, ""Oh, it's been 11 million for all this time,"" and the answer is not really. It was kind of like it hit 12 million, and then sort of steadily declined through the 11 millions, dropped below 11 million. And then by around 2017, 2018, really 2018, 2019, actually, started going back up again. So these people have been here a while, they're going to school, working, doing whatever. They're undocumented, but in a sense, not legal obviously, but I mean, they are paying taxes when they... Well, I don't know. That's my question. So- Yeah, a lot of them do pay taxes. And these are the people you call the Dreamers, and these are the people who were invited to apply for DACA. Explain that a little bit, but maybe we should deal with this chunk, and then go to the more recent ones who are being put up in hotels in New York City and so forth. Yeah. And so I think for that population, it is people crossing across the border. It was also a rise in visa overstays. As flights became cheaper and the world became richer, getting to the United States on a visa became easier. And there was a point in the early 2010s when the number of visa overstays, where visa overstays were a larger contributor to the undocumented population than people crossing the border."
ZalsQWpOt91,6088,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. ""We're on the right side of civil rights and we've..."" yeah. If we fix it, it's all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately. But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is connected to the America First stuff. Lindbergh's... The reason why Lindbergh likes the Nazis is that he wants to have, and I'm paraphrasing him now, but he wants to have a fortress of white people that are going to hold back the black and brown people. His fantasy is that we have a technological advantage across the Atlantic and, together with the Germans, we can basically keep the brown and the black people out of our countries. That's it. And it's direct organic. And you see that direct organic connection too, the folks now who talk about America First or isolationism very often bleed into or are quite openly on the wrong side when it comes to race. And then just as a footnote, it helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don't get. And I think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time around."
Ma8xnpUFPg9,9898,Mark Esper,"And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did. In my lifetime, if you had told me five, 10, 15, 20 years ago that there would be an insurrection on Capitol Hill and people would storm the Capitol and try and seize ballot boxes and threaten to hang Mike Pence, the vice president, it would be like a bad Hollywood movie. But it was real, and it should be a wake-up call for all of us. Well, to your credit, and you discussed this in the book at some length, in the spring/summer of 2020, you decided, I think in certain red lines that you needed to really be careful about, not just observing it yourself, of course you observed it yourself, but making sure that the Defense Department was not misused, that the military was not used inappropriately, that it wasn't politicized and used. Everyone was surprised, of course, by January 6th, but you were aware of the dangers, I'd say, of what might happen. Yeah, I ended up calling them the four no's. As you said, it was no politicization of the military, no strategic retreats, no misuse of the military. And of course, the fourth one would flee from my mind- No aggressive war."
oZ_EoAzXevG,6447,Tom Tugendhat,"Are you reasonably confident about the next three, six months in terms of the NATO countries holding together in a reasonably strong posture? Yeah, I am. Look, I mean, forgive me, but the UK has quite clearly been in the lead on this. And many people will know I've not always been- We expect no less, Tom. Yeah, I know you do, but- ...we Anglophiles, you know? Well, look, I've not always been full of praise for Prime Minister Johnson, as you know, Bill. Yes. We've had our division. But on this one he's been absolutely right. I mean, he has been important in building up that resolution to face Putin and to support the Ukrainian people. And I think he's been absolutely right on this. Ben Wallace, as I said, our defense secretary, was one of the first people to really see the danger and to respond to it. Our foreign secretary, who's very likely to be our next prime minister, Liz Truss, has been absolutely essential to building up the coalition of sanctioning entities and working with other countries, predominantly the European Union, but actually others as well around the world and making sure those sanctions work. And so actually, the UK has led very effectively on this. And other countries that have been ignored or rather not been noticed as much have been very important as well."
7UIscsBYjk2,3564,Doug Sosnik,"And sometimes it can be an important difference if it pops up and it becomes a kind of big story like the special counsel or whatever. But the predictable things, I mean, are we just in a new world where all that kind of stuff matters so much less or does any of those things VP, conventions, debates, what would you pick of those? Yeah, so it's a funny thing. I mean, the volatility of what's going on in our lives is at so much faster a pace than anything that we're ever accustomed to. It's almost mind-boggling to me if you think about where the world is now in February compared to where it was in June when we last got together. So on the one hand, the pace of what's happening is just at so much, and events that appear to be significant are so much greater than anything we've ever seen in our lifetime. On the other hand, the more this stuff happens, the less things matter because the fundamentally, it's the tectonic plates of the divisions in our country based on tribal politics right now that overrides almost everything else. And so as a result of that, it's really hard to break the tectonic plates of everyone being dug in. So back to your question, I would say the things I would watch are, one is the economy, and first of all whether it improves."
kx5e-gs69T6,7802,A.B. Stoddard,"And presumably if he's as healthy a year from now, he'll look that way in a presidential debate. And so getting to President Biden, you thought he wouldn't run 10 months ago and that was my view or my wish, I guess, that he might think about arranging a transition even if it's a messy primary to the next generation and so forth, but it looks like he's running. So what do you think? Is he running? Will he continue to be running? How much of a problem is the fact that he'll be 82? I say this totally not about his mental acuity or anything, but he doesn't look like Trump up there on the stage. And I think that they can say until they're blue in the face that, ""Trump's also an old guy. He is only four years younger than Biden."" And maybe the difference it looks doesn't matter. If you think Trump's a threat to the Republican, if you vote for Biden it's not a problem that his gait isn't as limber as Trump's. So give me your general take on all this. And so you talk to a lot of those people and you're in touch with them. First, it is strange because we've seen the presidency age people, most recently George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and we didn't really see it age Trump too much."
tXeyHFZCjme,6092,Jack Goldsmith,"And they didn't like something we were doing, we heard about it. I just get the feeling there's much... And that was bipartisan, it sounded like. We had Republican senators coming down our throat if they didn't like something as much as Democrats. I get the feeling a lot of that isn't what it once was, but maybe I'm just [inaudible]. That's my sense too. I don't study those areas as well. I study defense and intelligence. That's my sense too. I think in those area- Well, did Congress play a big role in your fights, I mean, was the Judiciary committee or senior members on the Hill important? After I left the Justice Department and things blew up, the Justice Department took a more aggressive role because they were changing some of the laws related to torture and stuff. The intelligence committees, they were being briefed on all this stuff and they were sometimes going along, sometimes pushing back. They got more aggressive because over time, they thought they weren't being given all the information they needed. I didn't have a big role in intersecting with the intelligence committees when I was at OLC, but they play a role. And listen, the intelligence community and the executive branch realizes that it has to keep its committees happy. It has a statutory duty to keep them informed and the intelligence committees can cause all sorts of problems."
xAEZvBpYCAf,13662,Anne Applebaum,"Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's partly a phenomenon of people being afraid of being attacked and being doxed, or the fact that MAGA controls a part of the social media, whatever we're calling it, the social media world is part of it. And maybe people are physically scared too. I mean, I know a lot of politicians are, that's part of the explanation for their weakness. But you're right, people who know better aren't saying anything, and it's a mystery. And that's also the mystery to the outside world. I mean, that's why people keep saying to me, ""Where is everybody? Where are all the Americans? Why aren't you doing anything?"" And then I say, ""Well, people are doing things, and it depends who you're following,"" but I think it's this, it's Intel's allowing some chunk of its company to be taken over by the state. I mean, you and I used to call that communism, that's called nationalization of the means of production. I mean, we're having kind of de facto kind of crawling nationalization. And it's also not just the tariffs, tariffs being bad policy, it's the way tariffs are being used. The tariffs are being used as a bargaining chip in some cases for Trump's private interests. The Vietnamese have offered some land for a Trump golf course, maybe in exchange for having a better tariff deal."
aGXSHsESEmq,6761,Aaron Friedberg,"That seems to be much more in harmony with Trump's own views. But again, we don't know. But to get back to your question, what that means is the range of uncertainty, the range of possible policies under a Trump administration is just extremely wide. And just the last point, it's not just a function of, and this would be more normal if you had schools of thought that are going to fight and maybe they're going to compromise and one's going to win on this and one's going to win on the other. Sitting on top of this, you have the maximum leader who's mercurial, capable of changing his mind, going from one thing to another. The thought that that administration with that leader is going to be capable of formulating, implementing and executing anything resembling a coherent sustained strategy, I think is fanciful. Yeah, that was very interesting because I had been thinking a little more actually of the gulf between a Harris foreign policy and a Trump foreign policy, which itself is a bigger split, I think you could say. The paths are more divergent than typically has been the case and a choice between, again, Kerry and Bush or whatever you want, Carter and Dole, even the Cold War choices really. But you make a very good point about Trump himself and his administration itself being uncertain."
TvoqV3eyYyG,7747,AB Stoddard,"I mean, I'm so struck in the coverage of that that no one even said, ""well, gee, I mean maybe the Justice Department needs to look into that. The FBI, they need to have a special task force. Maybe not a special counsel, but some people who look into career people see what happened here."" I mean, that's all so gone and I mean the implications of that for four years I think are pretty horrifying. Second thing is too much, but you can do both. So that I kind of expected, but I'd say the speed of it, I agree with you, is astonishing and dangerous in my opinion. Second thing is the assault on just the basic other parts of government that Trump had no particular problem with in his first term. Trump was not a libertarian, he wasn't reading books about... Cato Institute studies about how government was too big. He didn't particularly care much about that. And so far as one could tell, he even had a standard business type approach. Well, they waste a lot of money. On the other hand, he presumably does care about curing diseases and stuff, or at least isn't against it. The evisceration of CDC and NIH... that I really find slightly mysterious. He's not a rabble-rousing populist who thinks everyone with a degree as an idiot."
facHRPSwD2v,7776,AB Stoddard,"I think it's so interesting about third term because I'd say the conventional view been to dismiss it, as you said, it's like Trump being Trump. I think you're right. Both A, one shouldn't dismiss it in reality because it's not like, gee, the guy didn't try to stay in office before when there was constitutional and legal prohibitions against it. And B, as a kind of political matter, I kind of agree. It puts more concrete aspect on... He wants to control the entire government and states as well. He wants to have the Justice Department reward his friends, but he's not just doing that for three or four years, and then he's going to leave and let the next Justice Department investigate all these crimes. He may have immunity, but what about all the other people who don't? He wants to do this because he wants to be there for as long as he wants to be there. And if it's not him directly, it's his, I don't know who, his relatives or people who are totally loyal to him. I think painting that picture is a little hard because it's America. We're not used to that. And people don't focus that much on some of these more abstract, if you want to put it this way, issues."
zFTSfh2nai0,8418,A.B. Stoddard,"And I don't think there's a jury that would convict him in this country. Because I think there always will be an outlier among the jurors. And then I just think Ron DeSantis, we've seen him in a jam after the Stormy Daniels.... I mean, he tries to ""on the one hand, and on the other hand"" it, but they're terrified of infuriating the base. And so it's just this idea that he's both nervous in the lane and then he sort of has no destination. He doesn't have that plan like Chris Christie's articulated, which is, you have to literally take this guy on. You have to say, you only get four more years. He's tired with baggage. The legal peril is serious. Some of it's actually going to be serious, and he's going to lose women and he's going to, whatever case you want to make. He's too afraid to make it. And so that's why I just think, until and unless we see that they have found a place for him to land where they think that they can keep all of the Republicans, win all the Republicans who want to move on from Trump. And that's a pretty big amount. And then bring the voters after a few more headlines who were telling Sarah's focus groups a while ago, ah, I'm worried about him winning."
6mZx9Newtll,2223,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"They're just a lot of people and limited capacities and laws that are currently in place that maybe they'll try to change, but it's not obvious they can change radically, even constitutional protections at some point. And courts, which I suppose Trump judges can gradually change, but again, most of them are there already. So, part of me thinks listening to this, well, maybe it's all a huge amount of talk and not that much change. And part of me thinks, well, I don't know. Maybe they think having the border patrol plus ICE be the largest law enforcement agency in the country is appropriate. After all, we've got to defend our sovereignty. And after all, if we could be a little cruder about it, a lot of these people are going to be Trump supporters. And why shouldn't the deep state get rid of other parts of the deep state and beef up this part of the, I don't know, sovereignty state or whatever you want to call it, the anti-illegal immigration state? And I don't know, I mean, have they thought this through, do you think? Or is it just up in the air or what do you think about that? I think as you know, enforcement is hard, and I think the political debate doesn't want to really talk about that."
Y0hkmeMGy-T,12968,Anne Applebaum,"But that's not where Trump and Vance turned out to be, or at least not Vance, I mean, Trump's a little more confusing and stuff, but certainly Vance and the new right in America is not there. The new right is for authoritarian governments everywhere, they're as internationalist as we are in their own way, right? Well, we also have... I mean, I would draw your attention to a news story that came out of Denmark in the last 24 hours. The Danes have said that they have discovered, I haven't seen a lot of detail yet, but that they've found Americans conducting an influence campaign in Greenland designed to break Greenland off from the mainland. And they're summoning US Embassy. I'm not sure there's an ambassador there yet or not, and they're demanding explanation. So this is a concrete example of some kind of US covert campaign that's designed to undermine Danish democracy and the Danish government and Danish sovereignty in order to achieve something, I'm not sure what, with Greenland. I am still not 100% sure what the goal is there, but this is the kind of story that will change forever the way the United States is perceived. I mean, I was in Denmark a few months ago, and it's already happened there. The idea of the United States as like our benign friend, I mean, I think the US was the biggest Danish market, and Denmark had this special relationship with the US partly about Greenland."
VGlDk-KQJjg,7635,Aaron Friedberg,"But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think. Yeah, and praising them for standing up for their freedom and fighting, even when, I mean, it could have been critical of the Biden administration saying that initially they didn't believe that Ukraine could defend itself, but of course, Trump himself had taken a similar view. Again, I haven't read the full transcript, but the bit that I saw that referred to the war and the consequences talked about all the buildings that had been knocked down. And he says something like, ""If they hadn't done this, these buildings would still be standing, then they'd be there for 2,000 years,"" or something like that. So yeah, I didn't see anything there. Praising Ukraine for its resolve, praising Ukrainian democracy for rallying its people to defend their own government and their own territory, sympathy for the losses. He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject."
a-K7Hu1vHiF,9906,Mark Esper,"It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades. It's really about China and it's about China, Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese naval vessels in Japanese waters, in Japanese exclusive economic zones, sailing around the Senkakus, which I think the Japanese recognizes. And by the way, it's not just them who are saying fund Ukraine, it's Taiwan too is saying, because they recognize the common principle at stake here. And the common principle is this, if a big authoritarian neighbor invades a smaller democracy for the sole purpose of seizing that territory and incorporating it into their own domain, we need to fight for those principles or else the global order that we've known that's produced peace and prosperity for the last 75 plus years is going to wither away. And that's not the world we want to live in when we're living under Chinese values and Chinese interests. It'll be a far different world for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Or a world in which Putin could just invade a neighbor and slaughter people and then get away with it, keep a good chunk of the territory or all of it. Yeah."
y-FUkmDdfEi,3443,David Axelrod,"But Biden needs to compete on social media, and they're getting better at it. They've got to get a lot better at it. When Trump does crazy ass stuff that is in their message frame, they need to get that out fast, and they're doing more of that. But that's going to be a big battleground. A lot of these disaffected or disinterested voters are there, I'm not sure that the strategy to get those voters back is in place completely yet. He also has this money advantage, and he needs to take advantage of this in these battleground states by out-organizing Trump. There was a peace bill this last week in Arizona about how what complete disarray the Republicans are because their party is at war with itself. They're broke. The Trump campaign has no resources or hasn't applied any resources, so they have no organization. Four years ago, Trump had 60 organizers on the ground already. Now, he's got like six. Democrats ought to press that advantage organizationally in the battleground states. By the way, we were talking about this on Hacks On Tap . In terms of motivating voters, getting these choice initiatives on the ballot is really useful. So they're working on that in Nevada, I think in Arizona. There are some other states that are less battleground states where they're working on getting something on the ballot."
HBU1GKoOrbX,7095,Invisible Rulers,"And Twitter really struggled with it, with what to do about it. And I didn't struggle with it. I was like, ""Why aren't they taking it down?"" I felt like it was morally clear. But they saw it as like, ""Well, it's a global platform. We're the free speech wing and the free speech party,"" was what one of the... kind of friend of mine who was there at the time was saying. And this was, the, ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. We don't want to look like we're taking down content because the US government wants us to,"" et cetera, et cetera. And then you had this sort of series of escalating attacks where propaganda... People would see ISIS on Twitter and then would go and say, ""I pledge allegiance to ISIS,"" and then they would go and... There were actually a lot more people driving trucks into crowds, if you recall... Or the Bataclan Massacre, the nightclub in Paris, and Twitter eventually began to act and to take them down. And that sort of moment of the realization that all of the sudden, private companies have an incredible amount of power over geopolitical events, over what is happening in the public square. It really became, I think, this wake-up call as people began to realize that what an algorithm curated..."
UcRylSmvBSP,5469,Tim Snyder,"You're teaching me things I don't know about Hubert Humphrey. There's an awful lot I don't know about US history. I'm an American and a historian, but I'm not an American Historian, and I have a lot to learn. But it strikes me that in order to be an anti-fascist and anti-communist, the most important thing is you have to have a positive vision of the American future. The thing which Russia traffics in, and how Russia will win ultimately, is futurelessness. Their politics is a politics without a future. It's a politics which is built entirely on myths of the past. The war they're fighting against Ukraine is not really based upon some vision of how things will be better if we conquer Ukraine, it's based upon a lack of vision. We don't really know what we are, and therefore we have to destroy them, because destroying them gives us a sense of what we are. Everything is us and them, and since we don't know who we are, we have to have the ""them."" All the emotional energy, all the political energy goes against them. That can obviously sustain a war for a while, and it has sustained a war for longer than I think a lot of people expected. I think things are going quite badly for Russia, and I think the way that the only place they're really winning is in the American mind."
wX8ecmS7H01,6281,Larry Summers,"I hope that there will be a sufficient uprising of concern that that will not be what takes place, and I think the most likely thing is that this will be remembered as one of the many unfortunate episodes in American history from which when events were unfortunate, but friends were favorable. I think that it's always very, very important for all of us, particularly people like you and me, Bill, who engage in commentary, to remember that 75% of the news is about events, and 75% of events are bad. But most of what shapes reality is trends, even though it's mostly not what's in the news, and that there are a large number of favorable trends working in the direction of the United States. So I think the right posture is alarm but not despair. I'm with you on that. In this moment. But of course events affect the trends, as you said at the very beginning of our conversation. And if we radically cut back immigration and if we have a trend of scientific discovery and invention in this country, which has huge positive spinoffs and directly and indirectly in terms of some of the more government-financed science and medical stuff, that's where the trends can get bent, I suppose, by the events. Let me ask you two things that are somewhere between I guess events and trends, but you have great knowledge of and experience in dealing with in government."
KaRdnaPvSEe,3337,David Axelrod,"Let's be practical here and forward-looking, I guess, and what do we need to do? Where do we stand? What do we need to do? What's the biggest challenges?"" Then we can go through a whole thing for how do you make a better case for Biden? How do you make a better case against Trump? How do you deal with RFK Jr? Let's just give me the top line first. I mean, where do we stand? Yeah, let's start off with a small question. Look, I think that campaigns are all about narratives and we talk about issues, but issues are subsets of larger narratives. The Republican message, the Trump message is that the world's out of control and an enfeebled aged Biden is not in command. That's the Republican message for this election campaign. It seems to me that A, you have to be aware of that and counter that, and he's not going to run a half marathon, so that's out. But you have to have strategies to deal with that, but you need to know what your own narrative is. I mean, elections when your message is right is about the future, and my argument would be Biden's fighting for you and your future. Trump is consumed by his past and fighting for himself, and I would sort of build the campaign around that."
kJenzHO8hDE,3380,David Axelrod,"It's true. It's true. I mean if 3% of Trump supporters say, ""Oh my God, I didn't realize he was such a vaccine guy. I am for Kennedy,"" why isn't that a good idea? The danger of course if you do that, you have to be really careful with that because you could also normalize him for people who are on the fence and say, ""Well."" That's right. You also could... to a general group sort of find those points of similarity rather than differences between Kennedy and Trump and drive people who are anti Trump away from him. I think there are a lot of strategies that can be employed, but I think they need a special strategy. I think they know this to deal with Kennedy because he's not an idle threat here. He's not a threat to be president, but he's a threat to tip this race one way or another. Very much so, I just think you have a case where two-thirds of the country has said they don't want either Biden or Trump. They prefer not to have Biden or Trump. Let's be fair. There's too much possibility for third- and fourth-party candidates to get votes even if they- As we've seen, as we've seen, I mean Trump was president because of it. That is the exact scenario that elected him in 2016."
XWPwF2jhQUg,5180,Tim Snyder,"Fought antisemitism as mayor of Minneapolis when they were... It was not popular to do that. Was a huge, of course, civil rights leader, and was willing to split the Democratic Party in '48 at the convention on that. Threw the Communists out of the former Labor Party, and I don't remember exactly when, late 40s in Minnesota. But had of course defined himself in before that as an anti-fascist. There was an admirable tradition there, and people were able to do both of those things at once, it seems like. Maybe that will come back. Maybe say a word about Russia. What's the prospects there? How firm, how strong is Putin? Anything to hope for there? Then about the actual... I'm curious what you think about Ukraine itself, but also about its neighbors. The European situation as we move forward. Then we can come back to the US, which, as you say, is both the key and sadly maybe the weaker link. Okay. Let me just pick a segue out of what you said, because I think... You're teaching me things I don't know about Hubert Humphrey. There's an awful lot I don't know about US history. I'm an American and a historian, but I'm not an American Historian, and I have a lot to learn. But it strikes me that in order to be an anti-fascist and anti-communist, the most important thing is you have to have a positive vision of the American future."
7FNnCnapZYk,6444,Aaron Friedberg,"Whichever version of Harris you get, and to some degree, whichever version of Trump we get, I do think on Russia-Ukraine, it just seems pretty much more black and white. I mean, just hard to believe. Trump is just not going to be spending the next two or three years supporting Ukraine, it doesn't feel like, and fighting Putin and quite the contrary. The only question is how pro-Putin he'll be or how much he'll be sort of neutral, you might say, between Ukraine and Putin. And I think Harris, it's pretty safe bet, will be like Biden. Now, some of us would wish her to be stronger in helping Ukraine, but again, that's an unusual, I feel like, difference between the two candidates on what is probably the most important short and medium term, at least, choice facing the US and maybe the world. I agree with that. If you take those three areas, regions and ongoing crises or tensions, yeah, I think the variation on Russia-Ukraine would be the widest, and it's pretty clear. And even the people who are trying to make Trump out to be a coherent thinker and are writing articles describing what Trump's foreign policy could be in this sort of parallel universe where he pursues a consistent set of policies. And by the way, most of those people describe policies which are sort of Reaganites and I guess reflect their own preferences, but I don't think they really reflect Trump's."
byS8N5m0GZb,7217,A.B. Stoddard,"Do you want to start a political career and raise the money and run in this environment defending him? It sounds like fun, right? So that's interesting. And the other thing about how crazy this whole environment is, is that Democrats and Republicans, they both feel that the Democrats are likely to take the House and that the Republicans are likely to take the Senate. And that's something that I find a bunch of people in both parties agree on. Again, everything could completely turn around in the next 12, 14 months, but that's pretty interesting right now, that that seems to be the safe bet, a bipartisan safe bet. I also think, if it's a Biden Trump race, there could well be a third party, well, there always are third and fourth parties of some kind that could be a more centrist, maybe No-Labels-backed, third- party ticket that I assume won't ultimately go anywhere much and may go nowhere or may go for a while and then fade some. But of course, if it gets 2, 3, 4%, it could still be very important, given that the margin is less than that in key states. And there's a lot of evidence that the 2016 voters who voted third, fourth party, they didn't have that chance in 2020, and Biden won two-thirds of them and it probably was key to his margin in some of those really close states."
4T7_aVxgzEK,3247,Doug Sosnik,"And staged a coup, and we won't even go into it, but that's not quite where these swing voters are right now. I think some of our democratic friends, maybe our friends in the Biden White House in campaign sort of assume that, well, obviously if you're against Herschel Walker, you got to be against Donald Trump. But I think they underestimate just, yeah, the degree to which it can't just be a referendum on Trump, as you said, and then the age issue with Biden. It's a little puzzle. I mean, at first blush, it does seem sensible to say, ""Well, come on, why won't it be 2022 again?"" But those are Trumpy candidates who lost in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, except Trumpy candidates aren't quite the same thing as Trump, right? Well, and we've talked a lot about this and we talked about it last June. I mean, the fault line in American politics now is really education levels. And the reason that those six states that we mentioned earlier are the only competitive states right now is with the exception of Nevada, which has voted democratic even though it's towards the bottom of education levels. The other five states are all kind of in the middle of education levels. So that in most states you have 40 states right now in which one party controls the governorship and the legislature, and it's all based on whether or not they're highly educated or low levels of education."
1hPD49HlyFu,3792,Doug Sosnik,"One is we go back to ""Bill Kristol-adjacent Republicans"" for a minute. If you look at the 2022 midterm elections and the failure, despite all the advantages in the world of the Republicans to take back the US Senate, the day after the midterms in which for the second cycle in a row, Republicans did not take back the Senate when they should have. One of the reasons that Mitch McConnell said in his day after press conference was they didn't take control of the Senate in these swing states because of Republican voters defecting away from the right-wing Republican nominees. The other thing I'll mention about maybe explaining why either people are dismissing Trump or having selective memory about what it was like, I think there are a couple, there's one thing for sure, which I think really is an indictment of American government and leaders in politics. We're getting the kind of disconnect you used to see in Italy where you'd have 40 governments and 40 years and no one really cared because what was going on in politics and government had nothing to do with people's lives. And you had 40 governments in 40 years and they were like, ""Okay, we had 40 governments in 40 years. But life went on and nothing really changed."" And I think we're unfortunately getting a little bit like that in America."
ExTa3skariL,3095,Doug Sosnik,"And if you look at the impact of Bernie Sanders on the 2016 election, and the change of policy positions that Hillary took to get nominated, you look at Biden's 2020 primary, you look at positions he took as President of the United States. The United States senator that served for 35 years is a completely different guy on issues than what he did as president. And if you compare the Biden presidency on policy, compared to the Obama presidency on policy, it's way far to the left. And the reason why was- Not on foreign policy though, I'd say the opposite on foreign policy. Well, it depends on what your definition of foreign policy is. I think on trade- Well, trade, no, you're right, not on trade, fair enough, fair enough. ...in the international agenda economically. So, they've had this bargain. And you look at the impact that Elizabeth Warren had on all the appointments in the Biden administration on all the regulators. So they've had this sort of bargain which hasn't been... Is going to need to be litigated going forward, which is about progressivism versus the moderation. But the last thing I'll say is, I do agree with what you said about Whitmer and Newsom and all these people. But just to understand how it got there."
1WBS6vtXJg7,5624,Invisible Rulers,"So right now, I think the alternative for people is really to move to other places. Well, that gets to the question of power, which you mentioned earlier, which I think is a word which is important. That is, I think a lot of the discussion of in this area has been... And not yours, but others over the years has been interesting and thought-provoking, but it slightly misses sometimes just the pure power equation, and I think TikTok makes that so clear. I mean, people were really alarmed about what the Chinese government might be doing, or was doing, I think they were told in classified briefings, one has that impression on the Hill. They passed by big majorities. RENÉE DIRESTA: I wanted them to say it. I really felt like, my objection to the TikTok ban was that they didn't level with the public. Right. RENÉE DIRESTA: I feel like the authorities have to level with the public in cases like that. Well, they sort of did, right? That China was... RENÉE DIRESTA: No, they kind of hand waved about it. I really kind of wanted, I wanted Senator Warner in particular, somebody who's been fairly blunt about this stuff, to come out and say it. To give an example, to walk you through it. RENÉE DIRESTA: To walk you through it."
IPaPXXA5oPF,3785,Eric Edelman,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol, welcome back to Conversations . My guest today is someone we've had on several times, always a terrific interlocutor, to use a fancy word there. Eric Edelman, a long-time foreign service officer, ambassador to Finland and Turkey, worked in the White House for Vice President Cheney as his top national security advisor, and then number three official in the Pentagon. So, very distinguished career and a wide range of experience and a perfect person to discuss Donald Trump's trip last week to the Middle East with, and some of the implications of what he said there and what he did there, what he didn't do there and a couple of side tangents he went on. So, I don't know, I think it was a more newsworthy... Obviously, it was a sort of colorful trip and people covered it in that way, the camels, the plane, the sheiks, the business leaders with him. But it was a pretty interesting trip from the point of view of trying to think about Donald Trump's foreign policy. What are we now four months into the second term? Do you think, Eric? Well, I agree, Bill. First, it's great to be with you again and interlocutor is a great foreign service word, so thank you. I like to make Eric feel at home here."
IwT9WjqnGMR,6522,Invisible Rulers,"We weren't that friendly to the establishment media. We thought the more people the better. And I just remember going to speaking college campuses and being so pleased that students, this is much more simple-minded, but could have access to my friend Charles Krauthammer's columns, even though they were in The Washington Post and they were in college in Ohio somewhere because of the internet. And so that's the simple, hey, the more information, the easier to access it to, pretty easy to check things. Wikipedia, which some of my friends were very worried about, you remember the old days, you can't cite Wikipedia. It's going to degrade the whole profession of encyclopedias if that's a profession. And I remember always thinking, I don't know, maybe it'll be okay. And it turns out this is a typical case of everyone being wrong about everything. Everyone who was so worried about Wikipedia and totally missed what was really happening in social media. Wikipedia is fine. Wikipedia is not destroying America. It's not fine in every instance. God knows what your page or my page look like. I never look at it. And there are issues with it, but it's not done the damage that the stuff that everyone liked, Facebook and stuff, has done, I think. So it's funny how these things don't work out the way one expects, which is a good lesson for us thinking about the future."
3Nf3zKynrcq,2873,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head. Based on the Trump administration, if they just get more aggressive on raids or whatever we're supposed to call them, and the targeted actions and if they have the good enough information to know where to target actions and stuff, which maybe they do, I don't know, I mean, what would the plausible number of people... What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people? Hundreds of thousands of people? Tens of thousands for sure, because even the Biden administration has deported tens of thousands of people with criminal records. The previous administration deported every single year. Now, of course, when we say criminal records, I want to emphasize the number one most common offense is traffic offenses of a prior record. The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry."
h2fy4nwnLpr,6408,Jack Goldsmith,"And so every year, Congress weighs in with about 2,000 pages of new law working with the DOD, sometimes working against DOD. It's a complicated process and at least continuing through the last 20 years, 30 years, both the Intelligence Committees and the Armed Services Committees have done pretty robust oversight of the DOD and the Intelligence Committee. And frankly, they've worked pretty well together. My sense is most of the time, there've been some glitches obviously, and this is a very important and not well understood element of congressional control and regulation that actually still works better than almost every other element of Congress. And so it's not clear how this is going to work in the Trump administration. I mean, are the Senate and House Intelligence Committees going to really stand up and really give robust oversight to what Trump is doing? I'm a little doubtful, same with the Armed Services Committees. I don't know. We'll see. So that's my first take on Congress. I guess the point is there's actually more congressional involvement in the areas we're talking about, defense and intelligence on a regular ongoing basis by people who are motivated and informed on Capitol Hill, and the staffers in these areas in my experience, are excellent. But I don't know how it's going to work during the Trump administration."
CdcQbCVPuEw,16607,Anne Applebaum,"And this happened a few days ago. Using the FBI or its equivalents to conduct investigations into the president's personal enemies. People who have not broken any normal law or we don't know what kind of law they've broken. I mean, the breaking into John Bolton's house and ripping up his filing cabinet or whatever they did, I mean, why? And the idea that this is some kind of revenge for the FBI asking Trump to hand over files. I mean, that was an open process that was conducted over many days. And Trump was repeatedly asked to give back classified documents. And when he refused to give back the classified documents, which he was storing in Mar-a-Lago in his hotel, eventually somebody went in and said, ""We own these documents."" None of that happened with Bolton. We don't know why he was being investigated. And we do know that the head of the FBI tweeted about this investigation. So the politicization of these. This is a textbook case of how democracies go wrong and how countries become authoritarian or how people lose their rights is when you politicize agencies that are supposed to be neutral when there is no rule of law. And instead, there's rule by law. Rule by law means that the law is what the President decides it is."
6WXs97phui9,5616,Tom Tugendhat,"Other than that, NATO can coordinate intelligence sharing, but actually, quite a lot of that we're doing directly. It can enable cooperation in different ways. It means that, of course, we don't need a special agreement or you don't need a special agreement to fly weapons and ammunition over French and German and British airspace, or Dutch or Danish airspace to get it into Poland. You just do it. You're a NATO ally. You can do it. No problem about it at all. And the Ukrainians and the Poles can sort out the delivery from there. So, NATO is enabling a lot of things. The fact that it hasn't put a stamp on it and claimed it, I think, demonstrates frankly a rather mature attitude to the alliance rather than need to posture forward, and demonstrates the strength and the capability of the alliance too. Yeah and the government official I was talking to from a central European country said there's a ton of multilateral, it's neither bilateral nor NATO, but multilateral cooperations of like-minded or like-positioned or neighboring nations in terms of coordinating arms deliveries, whether that you guys take the lead on this, so we'll take the lead on that. The kind of healthy coordination and multiplication of efforts that's neither, let's have another meeting at the NATO headquarters with 30 people sitting around a table on the one hand, or entirely just bilateral Ukraine to Poland, Ukraine to Czech, Ukraine to [inaudible]."
R0NgZYPyb6Y,6111,Tim Snyder,"For me, that Umberto Eco essay, which you must know very well, from, what is it? '95 I think, Ur- Fascism, and which focuses, maybe because of where he's from, on Mussolini, as in a way, the instance... and he was really the originator of it, right? In Europe. Yeah, of course. That was a very revelatory for me, that you can have an unbelievably nasty and brutal regime. It doesn't quite look like what Hannah Arendt describes totalitarianism as looking like. And I guess that is Putin's Russia, right? Yeah. I would agree with most of that. I think, yeah, Arendt's book is brilliant, and it's been very important conceptually for me, too. And a lot of my work, including Bloodlands, which you kindly mentioned, is about agreeing but disagreeing with Hannah Arendt or starting with some observation of Arendt's... and she's, I think unquestionably, one of the extraordinary political thinkers of that century. But you're right that she's taking not just the Soviet Union, she's taking Stalinism. If you look at the Soviet Union under Brezhnev in the '70s, it's a very, very nasty place, and there's still a gulag. But it's a smaller gulag, and it's a country which has given up on this total vision of the future. But she's writing about Stalinism. Likewise as you say with fascism, she's writing about Hitler's Germany."
gB7kUJ4sm2g,2322,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Exactly. And I think if I can leave your audience with one message, it's that this stuff is way more complex than the politicians in DC make it out to be. And when you look at the Haitian population, some Haitians will have humanitarian parole, some will have temporary protected status, some will have Green Cards, some will be asylum applicants who don't have either. And when I was an immigration lawyer, you'd often have someone come in and say, ""Hey, my friend went through a situation XYZ and got result A, B, or C. I'm going through situation XYZ. Why are not I getting the same thing as them?"" And I would have to tell them, ""Everyone's case is different."" Even little random factors in a single given case, what year you entered the country, what month you entered the country, whether you've had one arrest versus no arrest, all of these minor little things can add up to very different results. And we may see that come across by the administration in very confusing ways. And so, to the extent that they try to make this out is one simple thing, ""We're just rounding people up who are the bad guys and we're deporting them and we're letting the good guys have a second chance,"" it's just more complex than that."
R49lSabZBuN,3903,Eric Edelman,"And I guess the order was Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE- United Arab Emirates. But since the headline of the trip became the plane, maybe we should begin with the famous, or infamous, Qatari 747. What do you make of that? Just, I don't know, meaningful? Colorful? Meaningful? Indicative of anything? Well, it's a perfect surrogate for discussion of the trip, in the sense that the trip was not about, as presidential trips typically are, geopolitics, but really more about geoeconomics. But in this particular case, it's geoeconomics with Trumpian characteristics. And I think Susan Glasser of The New Yorker captured it very well in her Letter from Washington this week, in which she said that the trip demonstrated that Trump really has no particular foreign policy doctrine. He was very critical of the Gulf petrostate monarchies that he traveled to in 2016 when he was running for president. He criticized Hillary Clinton for taking money from some of these states, including Qatar. And he obviously has no problem with it now, including this ""gift."" And I say gift in scare quotes because according to both the conversation you had recently with Tom Malinowski, former member of Congress, former colleague of mine in the State Department, but also reporting, very detailed reporting in The New York Times today, this didn't exactly start out as a gift."
4I84mjHtJn7,2156,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Then they take your fingerprints, they run you through a number of databases again, and under the CBP One process, you are then given one year of humanitarian parole. That lets you get a work permit so you can get on your feet more quickly. After a year, the humanitarian parole expires and you are placed into immigration court proceedings. But the hope is that you would've already applied for asylum in the interim and then be able to transition onto a work permit through an asylum application and sort of not end up being a burden on state and local governments because you can immediately work. And that is sort of how the Biden administration has changed the incentives, trying to tell people, ""Look, if you go through this process, you will have a much more stable way of supporting yourself in the United States. But if you enter illegally, there's a good chance we're going to turn you away or send you back to Mexico or deport you to your home country. And once you come in, you don't have any initial status, you are not going to be able to work legally. It's going to be a much more difficult time for you."" And that really has, I think, is in a nutshell how the Biden administration has, by 2024, come to think about the border, as their goal is to incentivize using these alternate legal pathways and disincentivize people from crossing illegally."
49hFe9iQbYk,6788,Invisible Rulers,"The vaccine is going to kill you, it's anti-God, it comes from cows and it's going to turn you into a human-cow hybrid. Right? They're talking about smallpox- But if it's the same stuff, doesn't the algorithm change everything though? RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, that's how you get at that. It's the targeting. The algorithm changes the targeting. So content and distribution are two separate things. Content is what you're going to read, what you're going to pay attention to. Sorry, let me actually differentiate that. Content is what you're going to read. It's sort of the substance of the stories. It's the narratives themselves. But what you're going to see is a little bit more targeted for you. So there's a whole bunch of different stories out there in the world that could describe a particular phenomenon and they can all be inflected for your particular identity. And so as a pro-vaccine mom in California, I can read... I was reading a story in the New York Post this morning about... It was sort of going viral on X. There's a relative of JD Vance's who is trying to get a heart transplant and her parents don't want to have her vaccinated, so she's not eligible. So this is going to outrage everybody for entirely different reasons. And so it's going to be targeted to people using very different framings, even though the facts of the story are the same."
33x2iLJByvm,15973,Anne Applebaum,"But let's begin with Europe and the German elections right next door, more or less, to Warsaw, yesterday. What does it mean? What does it mean for Germany? What does it mean for Europe? What conclusions do you draw? So there are a couple interesting things about the German elections. As your listeners probably know by now, the Christian Democrats were the largest party. They won a plurality of votes. This is the center-right party. This was Angela Merkel's party. Historically, they emerged from Christians who after the Second World War, believed that there was a more moral way to do politics. A long time ago for a book that I wrote 10 or so years ago, I interviewed some very old men who were a part of that movement. So that just places them in history. The new leader, the new Chancellor of Germany will be Friedrich Merz, who has been in and out of politics. He was a businessman. Merkel didn't like him. He came back. The interesting thing about Merz is that he's someone who all of his life has been a real transatlanticist, so dedicated to NATO, a believer in the US Alliance. And yesterday I believe, he was being interviewed on election day, and he said something that to me was astonishing. He said, ""Germany needs to begin to think about becoming independent of the United States."" In other words, the most centrist, the most pro-American, the most pro-NATO piece of the German political spectrum now wonders whether the United States can be an ally anymore."
KP-cC9jMXx9,3495,Eric Edelman,"And that in public, although he has hewed to the line that the president and others have said that Iran cannot have any enrichment capability, they've got to dismantle their enrichment capability, Araghchi has said in private, it's clear that Witkoff has suggested at a minimum some flexibility on that question and perhaps more. That would be consistent, by the way, with what Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson when he went on Tucker Carlson's show and what he had said publicly before. It's not inconsistent with what the president and Marco Rubio have said when they have said Iran should be allowed to have some civil nuclear capability. So I think it's very murky right now. And most recently the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has said that he's very doubtful about these negotiations because the Americans keep insisting on no enrichment and that they should stop insisting on no enrichment if they want an agreement. We know that Trump is very flexible about these things. We know he doesn't care that much about details. I think there are a lot of Republicans in the Senate in particular, but also some in the House, who have been very hawkish on Iran, who are very nervous about what kind of agreement might come out of this, and whether there's some kind of, in Witkoff's phrase, elegant solution to this that involves either some suspension of enrichment during the Trump administration's term, but allows them to restart later, or whether they're allowed to have some low-level enrichment, but will have to export out the [Low Enrichment Uranium] to some other place."
VbRj8WUpjAH,16731,Anne Applebaum,"You have to redo it so that it works for your circumstances. I have also been in, last September, I was in an underground control room where dozens of soldiers, mostly wearing t-shirts, were sitting in front of computers, and they essentially had the whole frontline. They could see the whole frontline, and they were coordinating drone operations across the front line from this place. That kind of stuff, that's how the war is really being fought. And obviously the Ukrainians need bullets and they need the long-range missiles. There's a lot of stuff they need US intelligence, but a lot of the war is they're better prepared to fight it than you think they are, just because the nature of the war has changed. The most important things to supply Ukraine with are going to be air defense so that they can continue pushing back against Russian air attacks. And by the way, a couple of days ago, the Russians launched one of the largest air attacks that they've launched in the entire war. It was something more than 260 different kinds of drones and missiles. And that's from somebody who- they'd just been negotiating with the Americans in Riyadh. So the Russians aren't showing any indication that they want to stop. But the Ukrainians are able to hit thousands of Russian targets every month."
KHRv_lZTwaE,7466,James Carville,"We need to be a little clear in delineating our enemies here. But there's also a limit to what the president and his campaign can achieve. If you had a candidate of George W. Bush, I believe Obama or Clinton, most candidates, they could go out and execute. Biden can't do that. That's an asset that they just have to be very careful how they deploy, and it has to be only under laboratory conditions. That's just a function of having an 82-year-old candidate, or soon to be an 82-year-old candidate. It's just one asset you don't have. Yeah, one keeps coming back to that fortunately, but it is what it is. Do you agree that the Trump campaign, leaving aside Trump who's not very disciplined and says some things he probably shouldn't and all that, but the Trump, A, he's not without skill himself, obviously he's a demagogue, but the Trump campaign has been pretty, I say this with regret, but pretty competent and pretty professional, don't you think for the last year or so? I do, and it's much better. I think just Susie Wiles is kind of a professional, and it does seem, and other people have said the same thing, it was more of a haphazard, by-the-seat-of-your-pants, Steve Bannon, everybody fighting over money. I do think it's more disciplined."
LO5uKxUwwFV,4987,Aaron Friedberg,"But the course of action that Trump proposes would be one that would, I think, isolate the United States from the people that we need to collaborate with in dealing with China economically and from dealing with Russia and these other problems strategically. So that's at one end. I don't know exactly, of course, what a Harris administration would do. I think the Biden administration has taken some steps in the right direction. They've imposed some tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and some of the other pieces of the so-called green energy transition. And they've also begun to think about how to subsidize or how to encourage domestic production, but it's been pretty narrow and pretty selective. And I think it's going to have to be wider than that, and it's going to have to be done on a coalition basis. So yeah, those issues are coming and they're here already and there's question of how Harris or a Trump administration would respond. The thing we know, I think most likely a Harris administration would continue on the path that Biden is following, which is okay as far as it goes, but it needs to go a lot further. I think from everything we know, Trump would go off in a very different direction that would I think scuttle the possibility of forming a tighter coalition of friendly countries economically to deal with China because I think he sees them all as unfair competitors and taking advantage of the United States and wants to impose tariffs on everybody."
7WMx110YDcR,3314,Doug Sosnik,"I think if you asked me anything about single issue why Trump lost in 2020, and I think the country felt exhausted from him and just didn't really have the stomach and appetite for four more years of chaos. And so a big part of the Biden candidacy was the adults coming back and putting order. And I think that for a combination of factors, some of which have nothing to do with Biden, some of which do have to do with Biden, I think that people, despite the fact that you can look at consumer confidence has gone up in the last 90 days and a bunch of other metrics and unemployment is still low. And inflation, as I mentioned is down, is I think that people feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about their life and about their future, and that the adults did not come back and make things more calm. And then the third, which is obvious, we're now clocking in and over three years of Biden being three years older now than he was three years ago. I do think that in the context of what I just mentioned, I think he does really appear older to people, not steady to people and not reassuring. And I think those combinations have given Trump an advantage, which as I mentioned earlier, we've now seen show up in the polling."
zjL-U2FBMu5,7018,Jack Goldsmith,"Right. But something of a culture of, well, no, we can't really, if the serious person says this is just wrong or bad law, we can't quite just ignore it and- This is getting a little bit in the weeds, but especially when it comes to criminal law and without relitigating old disputes or going into too much detail, with the Terror Surveillance Program we in the Justice Department ruled that parts of it couldn't go forward under earlier interpretations because we just thought they were dead wrong. And originally the White House disagreed with us and overruled us, which is their prerogative to do. I mean as OLC, I was exercising authority delegated from the President of the United States, and it was always overrulable by the AG or the president. President Bush did that but then he reversed himself the next day and he went along with us and the reason was there was going to be a massive meltdown in the Executive Branch. And the reason for that is we had looked at it hard and they hadn't really taken a genuine, independent, fair-minded crack at the legal issues. And more importantly, when the Justice Department says something would violate criminal law if done, that is very fraught even if the president says it's okay for anyone to go forward."
zj5XQdMie3w,7788,Mark Esper,"I guess I had not... I studied politics. I taught at the Kennedy School. I didn't really appreciate what it was to try to run a department, deal with the Hill, which has legitimate oversight and then annoying oversight of one zone of everything you're doing, and that meant dealing individually with members and of course testifying and that kind of thing, dealing with the media, dealing in your case with foreign governments, dealing with the inter-agency process, which is extremely complex and time- consuming, both formal and informal, you can say a word about that, at your level, the cabinet level with Secretary of State and intelligence agencies, everyone, I mean, it's just so many different spokes, I think that's a little different. CEOs have some of that, but it's all these different actors who have legitimate claims on your attention, it's not that they're just... Now, that part, I remember, just hadn't fully appreciated until I got to Washington. Yeah, I think that is a striking difference with a CEO or the head of any kind of company or association is there are so many stakeholders up and down the chain of command. Externally, I mentioned think tanks and associations and members of Congress and labor unions and companies who are part of the defense industrial base and venture firms, what I'm doing now."
MvtHyjYP6Lb,2607,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Or is it just up in the air or what do you think about that? I think as you know, enforcement is hard, and I think the political debate doesn't want to really talk about that. But of course, this is something everybody knows intuitively. It's illegal to deal drugs, and yet there are many drug dealers in the United States. And despite the United States trying many, many, many for many, many years to crack down on the drug trade, we've had limited success. So, there are some things that you can pour money to stop. And yet really, in the long run, struggle to actually carry out and do. It's obviously that's a different scenario, but that emphasized that simply throwing money at an enforcement problem isn't necessarily going to solve it. But I do think that they are already internally tempering expectations. Crucially, however, they also operate in a world of propaganda where a lot of these nuances can simply be ignored. And if they can say, ""Every year we're rounding up...""-if they can send a Fox News camera crew to every arrest of an undocumented sex offender, and every time they get that, they've got somebody on the ground saying, ""Here's President Trump protecting your communities."" Even if those arrests are the exact same kind of arrests that occurred under the last five administrations, even if they've only managed to ramp up enforcement 20% year over year."
xvA9IHsHLOv,15551,Anne Applebaum,"In the campaign, he promoted the AFD, he did a live interview with their leader on Twitter. JD Vance also made a subtler and even more insidious intervention in the campaign by denouncing Germany for not being sufficiently in favor of free speech at the Munich Security Conference a few days ago. And that was also understood in Germany as a kind of attack on the German establishment. It's blatantly not true. The AFD were campaigning, their leader was on TV. It's not like they're some kind of repressed political party, even though some of their members do come very close to violating German law in some of the things they say about Nazi Germany. Germany has special laws, anti-Nazi laws. We can argue about whether we would have them in the United States. But they're not the United States, and they're allowed to have anti-Nazi laws if they want to, given their history. Anyway, so there is a large, far-right for the first time. A disproportionate number of its votes come from Eastern Germany, from the eastern part of what used to be the Soviet-dominated part of Germany. I can talk about that at length if you want, but we can come back to it. The main point is that it looks like because a couple of smaller parties dropped out, it looks like Merz will form a coalition."
GlwzM0dB6x7,9087,James Carville,"Absolutely. And you live and you learn. I've learned. I've seen how global conflicts work. I've seen how domestic unrest works. I've seen these things and you can accuse me of growing. Right? That'd be good. You can. One of my favorites was John Maynard Keynes said, ""When the facts change, I changed my mind. What do you do?"" You can sit there and argue forever. I just changed my mind. You might've argued in 2002 and Bill Clinton, I mean Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama would agree with you that gay marriage was a bad idea. Okay, I've changed my mind. He said, ""Well, in 1997 you said this."" Okay, fine. I don't think that anymore. It'd be interesting to see if she actually just says those words, ""I've changed my mind."" I think it would actually be effective and it would play into the notion or help the notion of making her campaign forward-looking, not relitigating, everything she ever said and not... Knowing what I know about this office, if you talk to me four years from now, there are going to be some things I've changed from own also. Yeah. You got to get out of it with some humanity and humor. But if you start explaining structural racism and police reform and community outreach, you're dead. At that point, you're dead."
ACGIzcr0jG6,17304,Anne Applebaum,"The fact that he's printed these lists of fraud that he supposedly found that are untrue, that he keeps mentioning things that he's cut, which turn out to be fake... No, there were not $50,000 of condoms going to Gaza. No, there was not money being paid to Chelsea Clinton. No, there was no money that was being paid to Politico , the website. So they keep claiming to be doing things. And so all of which leads me to conclude that as I suspected the Department of Government Efficiency is not really interested in efficiency. What it's interested in is what you have to call regime change. It's interested in changing the civil service, politicizing it, politicizing the state. It's what political scientists call ""state capture,"" and they are, and that's the program. And I wrote this in The Atlantic , but it's also... I wrote about it in Twilight of Democracy in 2020. I wrote about it in the context of Poland, like what was motivating it and what made people support it, but it's, again, not that original. It's been done a lot of times and places. The original piece is the way Musk is doing it. That's very radical and new. And I would say for me, I expected Trump acquiescent and Trump loyal people to be put in places like DOJ and the FBI and DOD and the Defense Department."
Q3abkY1X0SD,8246,Robert Kagan,"And I suspect that's kind of common. It's in between World War I, and it ends with the Depression, and then there's, of course, the '30s. People know a lot about that. But your account of the 20s was so striking. So talk a little bit about what happened in the 20s. And am I right that it's kind of a nice snapshot of what we're... it's exactly what you're just talking about, that this is something that we should be more familiar with than we are. Yeah, I've been struck ever since I've studied the 20s at how similar the 1920 election is to the 2016 election. If you had the point to an election where there really was a kind of, again, rebellion against a trend in American politics toward greater liberalism, that election was 1920. And the only difference is we elected some guy, some second rate... or even he almost acknowledged that he was a second rater, Warren Harding, and not this incredible demagogue with this unusual personality that Trump is. But the thing that's important, and we can go into some detail if you want to, but the thing that's important about the 20s is that it demonstrates that it is not a steady climb upward toward liberalism in America. That was a real step back, toward a more white- centric... in a sense, it was a period of whites trying to reclaim what they were losing."
ZWktp-5Kwk7,10100,Mark Esper,"Trump did not take those lessons as well. Look, in many ways, things we were recommending pushing back against proved to be true. I often wonder whether he looks back and says, ""Thank goodness they were pushing back on me."" The best example is Afghanistan. Trump was constantly pushing to get out of Afghanistan, withdraw our troops. And as I talk about in a later chapter of my book, in October of 2020, before the election, he's going out there publicly buttressed by his national security advisor saying, ""We need to get out by Christmas,"" two months away, 2 1/2 months away, which was logistically impossible to do unless you left everything there and just put soldiers on planes and left, and we cautioned against that. I wrote a classified memo at the end of October saying we shouldn't go below 4,500 troops unless the Taliban does this or that or this or that. I've said publicly that I thought we should have used military pressure to get them to abide by the agreement. If not, we could have returned forces. But anyway, so the bottom line is we talked him out of a rapid precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan only to see what, 7, 8, 9, 10 months later Biden do the exact same thing, a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan."
2DiDXinrsAX,2908,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status. That's something a lot of people had not heard much about and suddenly became a thing, TPS. Trump could make it harder for some of those people to stay in the country and not extend their status or curtail their status, perhaps. How does that work? Explain maybe for a second. There are quite a few people on temporary protected status in the country. That's right. And I think this is a good point to emphasize that the biggest immediate changes Trump can make on day one or within the first few months is to legal immigration and people who have some form of temporary legal status in the United States. So, for people who have temporary legal status, we estimate there's around 2 million people who currently are in the United States with some form of temporary executive-led legal status. Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole."
sh4rE4kF_M4,6274,Invisible Rulers,"Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I'm Bill Kristol. Very pleased to be joined today by Renée DiResta. A first time Conversations guest, but an excellent... I don't know why I was so slow in having you on, but a research professor at Georgetown, associate research professor at Georgetown, author of a very good book that I really do recommend that came out, what, a few months ago I think, The People Who Turn Lies into Reality . Renée is one of, really, our leading students of, I guess, what? Influence and propaganda online maybe? I don't know. And has made many... Amassed an impressive list of horrible people who have been your enemies for exposing what they have been doing online. So as someone who's cultivated a certain amount of enemies over the years, or at least critics is the nice way to say it, and has taken a certain pleasure in that, I want to congratulate you for doing this at your young age. RENÉE DIRESTA: Thank you so much. Anyway, great to have you with me. And you're going to explain influence and propaganda online and what could possibly be done about it. And I guess let we begin with just the obvious sort of question, and maybe put it in a contrarian way. I mean, how powerful is this phenomenon really?"
f_MqDkPyvNp,7772,Robert Kagan,"Right. Lincoln was worried that people had it during the revolution, but lost it afterwards. Jefferson was worried that they would in fact lose it after the revolution was over. And I think we are in that situation, and a lot of it is because people just get complacent. You know? The fervor for rights, the fervor for the declaration comes from people who need it in order to equalize their position in America. So those who feel excluded, those who feel disdain, those who are in fact limited in their ability to enjoy the full freedoms of the United States, are always going to be the ones who are most committed to the principles of liberalism and the principles of the founding. And as they get comfortable in society and no longer feel that their rights are in any way endangered, then they start looking for other things and they don't care as much about that. I think that there is an element of that. Obviously, as you say, that's what happened to Irish Americans and Italian Americans and other of those kinds of ethnic groups. To some extent, it's now happening among a certain number of minority groups who have hitherto been discriminated against, and now, almost by definition, they must feel comfortable enough that they don't feel the need for liberalism to protect them anymore."
yEBgORp7-7I,7853,James Carville,"And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have? I don't see it going any [inaudible]. Maybe it will, but right now it is pretty hard to see how this thing ends. Yeah. And I guess this is the trouble with being an incumbent, right? I mean that you are blamed for stuff that happens that you're not really responsible for, but the world looks chaotic and... Right. So Bill, the people are demonstrating against Biden and the public is blaming Biden for the demonstration. So I mean you got to be in a really bad situation where people are protesting you and people are bad and you're allowing people to protest. One time, there was a story I read, I couldn't stop laughing. It was some anti-Biden-Gaza protesters, and there was some Proud Boys or something, counter-protesters, and the only thing they could agree on is they started chanting, ""F Joe Biden, F Joe Biden."" And then the public thinks that, well, Joe Biden can't control his demonstrators. He's the only person that's divided... that brought the unite the right and the Palestine liberation, whatever these people call themselves."
ykbmBaPAjsQ,6336,Invisible Rulers,"Algorithms though do key off of things that you like, things that people who are like you like. And then when that happens, you are put into these buckets, if you will, where you're going to see more of a certain type of thing, so those identities are reinforced. And what you start to see is people will also really become very passionate defenders of some of those political identities in particular. They'll put an emoji in their bio so you know exactly what they are the minute that you see them, and then they'll fight with other people who are on the other side, in a different tribe. So that dynamic is very real. But I kind of got into studying this in part as an activist, not as an academic, because I wanted to pass a pro- vaccine bill in California as a pro-vaccine mom. And I think every time people start looking at something, they think like, ""Oh, this just happened, this is the very first time this happened, this is completely new."" But I started reading about anti-vaccine narratives and realized that you could actually go back and pull up the British Medical Journal archives from the 1800s, and it is the same stuff. The vaccine is going to kill you, it's anti-God, it comes from cows and it's going to turn you into a human-cow hybrid."
h-Ua7sDV8zL,5354,Tom Tugendhat,"I mean, 20 years ago-maybe you were involved in some of these conversations-there was talk, ""How can we really confront China without an Asian NATO?"" But maybe we don't need an Asian NATO. What we do need is a lot of cooperation between key nations, which can be done under different rubrics and different coalitions of the willing, I guess. I think that's right. I wouldn't undermine or belittle what NATO's doing either. I mean, NATO has created the norm and established the diplomatic agreements, which mean that all these things are interoperable. And that's not nothing. That's- Yeah, that's important, right? That's really important. That's been going on for over 60, 70 years, so that is important. Do you need to do those? Could you do those in different ways? Sure. Yeah, you can, but it is important. I think what's interesting is, as I say, it's this change from the very obvious multilateralism of the 1950s and '60s and '70s to a return to a form of nationalism. And I don't want to overstate that, but to have a form of identity with the nation state, that means that international organizations, the good ones, are more enablers and the bad ones are the ones that seem to be trying to replace nation states. And bad, I'm not trying to make a moral term, I'm trying to make..."
t1C5pmEOtEy,4229,Doug Sosnik,"And people feel the impact every day when they're walking around and see these people sleeping on the streets and the safety. But it's also a proxy for what I mentioned earlier about just the sense that things are not in control here now and that there's not really a strong government in place to bring our lives back to normal. I'm struck how much the retrospective, maybe slightly inaccurate, but whatever, view of things were much better when Trump or somewhat better when Trump was there. It helps him so much, right? I mean, if someone like me, here's what he says about NATO, and I think, A, that's incredibly irresponsible and dangerous and B, it actually suggests what a second Trump term would be like and it would be much more dangerous than a first Trump term. But I have the impression, voters they hear this stuff, it's all kind of noise. Trump's just being Trump. He says these things, but the thing they have to compare that's fairly concrete is the Trump first term, or I suppose more accurately the memory of the Trump first term and the perception of the current Biden term. And I feel like that gives Trump a cushion that a normal challenger who said these kinds of things doesn't have. I mean, he's weirdly advantaged by being both the challenger, the outsider, the change candidate, and hey, he was president."
zURq21Hp154,5747,Tom Tugendhat,"Yeah, that's good news I think, and a little more optimistic. Maybe the people here there's a little bit of glass half empty, I'd say. Thinking among some of my friends here in DC, that every time there's a little hiccup or some German politician says something that's not 100% robust, they go, ""Oh my God, the Europeans are falling apart."" But I've got to say that they've done less falling apart and more hanging tough, and obviously pushed on by their neighbors, by the Eastern Europeans and Central Europeans and by you in the UK that they've hung tougher than I would've expected. So maybe there really is a pivot in Germany. Again, there's a certain amount of skepticism here, I'd say, about the Zeitenwende and is it talk and is the money going to be real and so forth. But you seem to think it is pretty real, right? Well, I mean the money's real, the words are real, supplies are real. Let's now see more of that going to Ukraine. I mean, the Ukrainians are, it was one of the things that really struck me was how mocking Ukrainian politicians and individuals were about German military support, which I can understand. But at the same time, let's not forget 15, 20 years ago, Germany would've offered no support to anyone at all."
Yo-5qnTuo2V,4770,Tim Snyder,"I think that's where the conversation should start. And then it's like, ""Okay, well then what are we doing for them? For this strategic bonanza and this moral example, what are we doing in return?"" I think that's where the conversation should be starting. Because as I see it, I mean, there are a lot of reasons to care about Ukraine, and I care about Ukraine as such. But even if you didn't, if you're just an American concerned about American interest, there's a kind of unusual strategic opportunity here where so many things are possible for so few resources. And even if you're just a hardheaded American realist, this is a historical opportunity which you're never going to see again, and I wish people would care about the moral issues. But even if they don't, I wish people would care about our own interests, because our own interests point in exactly the same direction here. That's such an excellent point and eloquently stated, and I think an appropriate place to close. But we should get back together maybe after... Hopefully things look more promising in November 2024, and maybe we can talk more about the future and about a brighter future. Whereas I think, as you say, so well, I mean this... 2024 could be a real turning point, not just for Ukraine, but for all of us."
4bXDpXWTb0V,5217,Tom Tugendhat,"They want freedom. They want exactly the same things you guys fought for on a couple of occasions against us, and that we fought for in order to protect our own freedoms in the last century. This is not unusual, and other countries around the world want it too ,quite rightly. You know, I think... We look back and we think that NATO was more homogeneous, and that those kinds of international organizations wish to be more homogeneous than they did. I mean, some people wanted them to be more, but of course, NATO... We thought we were the only nuclear power. The whole point of NATO was, ""Don't worry, Britain and France. You don't need nuclear weapons."" ""Well, thank you,"" but Britain and France decided, ""You know what? I think we just prefer to have our..."" France, of course, just went off. Yeah, it will take. France, in the sixties, then of course famously with de Gaulle, but also many others. Germany had a very different situation because of the war, because of its history, in terms of its military commitments to NATO, West Germany, at the time. Then France, and then Britain. And so, I think this kind of intelligent, I don't know what you'd call it exactly, nation state specific multilateralism has always been there among the better thinkers in the West and better practitioners really."
PE5Rr4fZbEl,7548,Jack Goldsmith,"And a very high percentage of pardons, when you think about it, including Clinton's example, which are pretty deplorable, the huge majority of them are cleaning the record as a favor of someone. Maybe you shouldn't do it. It's not quite equitable. But the two previous family pardons, Bill Clinton's brother, I think had served a year in jail in the '80s. Clinton pardoned him in 2000 to kind of clear the record, so to speak, and the same was true... There's another one, which I'm blanking on, but where it's a very similar situation. Yeah, I can't remember, but there's one other. It's a previous... It's an old, so to speak. Yes. This was the middle of a court case. He'd gone to trial, he'd chosen to go. It was kind of messed up the way the plea deal fell apart, but he'd chosen, in any case, to go to trial. There was a jury. It wasn't like this was some arbitrary star chamber thing. I don't think people thought the trial was particularly unfairly conducted or anything. He was, of course, ready to appeal. He had plenty of attorneys to do that. I feel like doing it in the middle like that is more egregious in a way than doing a favor for someone that you respect or to be fair to someone you think was a good civil servant, a good public servant who deserves to, in a sense, have a break retrospectively."
-LqcIrww3dc,3342,Eric Edelman,"And it also allows them to, because of the hold that they have on us through the base and relations with presidents like the one they want to have with President Trump, it allows them to also do things like host Al Jazeera , which stirs up lots of trouble in the region against other Arab states, moderate states. But also to allow them to host Hamas and be a major sponsor traditionally of the Muslim Brotherhood. So the Qataris are very interesting. They kind of keep all of their bases covered. And the one difference I think between the relationship that they have with Donald Trump and with previous presidents, in previous presidencies it's always been clear that the relationship was a state-to-state relationship carried out through normal channels of government, embassies in capitals, etc. With Donald Trump, it's actually something that is more traditional in the region and they're more comfortable with, which is a very personal relationship, in this case between the Al Thani family and the Trump family. And I'm using the Trump family in the most expansive sense of the term because Steve Witkoff, his negotiator, for instance, has major business ties to the Qataris that precede his entry into the second Trump administration as a foreign policy player and Swiss army knife negotiator for all trades."
WtsfvrSFuxJ,6729,Invisible Rulers,"During COVID, very often the institutions would wait to speak until they were sure. You saw this in the earliest days of COVID around, how dangerous was it? You saw it with the conversation around masks. Did we need them? Was it airborne? All of these things where people who were paying attention to Chinese social media, were realizing that doctors were dying. There were massive morgues being set up. It was pretty clear that something was very, very dangerous. People were studying past outbreaks and were saying... Influencers on social media were saying, ""We should be wearing masks."" And the CDC was kind of not saying anything. And so there was this sense of them almost... And then they would come out a couple days later when they did feel like they had data and evidence, and they would come out and say something. But this gave the sense of almost leading from behind. And that's because science doesn't happen on the timeline that social media virality does. And this is just the reality of the world. But you can do a little bit more to be out there and say, ""This is what we know right now. Our information can change tomorrow. Here is how we are thinking about this particular crisis in this particular moment."" The other thing though is that, per your point a little bit earlier, the doctors have to get it right."
jWrvigXy6yZ,7780,Tom Tugendhat,"We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know? But he still did it. He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it. I think we underestimate the importance of President Zelensky's courage to the shape of the world as it will be in 10 years time. If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty."
q0MTDw9ElUT,6227,AB Stoddard,"So the thing that I'll finish with, Bill, is that I am not surprised by the force of what we've seen. I am only surprised by the speed. Interesting. Yeah, I'd say two things and then you're free to comment on one. Yeah, I think maybe, I mean I was always very conscious of the guardrails in the first term, the internal guardrails. I spoke to some of those people before they went in and at that time I didn't urge them, but I agreed with their decision to go in. I wasn't one of those who criticized from the outside when John Kelly and Jim Mattis and John Bolton and people like that went in because I thought, and they did constrain him. We didn't quite know as much of course about Washington. He was surprised to have won. It was easier to push back and there were a lot of people pushing back at once. People underestimate that, I think. That I had a feel for having been in government. If you have Pompeo and Bolton and Esper, and they're all telling you in different ways, ""You can't quite do this."" You can be a tough guy as Trump likes to think he is or have a few other people on the outside saying go for it, but it's just hard practically to pull that off."
Eb2FkIJmMcr,7019,Invisible Rulers,"Things are always changing. There's new features, new platforms. The stuff I was talking about earlier with regard to Bluesky, these new protocol-based platforms are a whole different type of architecture that's really interesting. AI changes constantly. That, I think, some of the trust issues get really serious there. It's very hard to know what to trust. There was this Kanye West Super Bowl ad that led to this terrible site with a swastika T-shirt. And then there was this video made in response, a highly, highly plausible, incredibly realistic looking video of celebrities wearing shirts with the middle finger up, alluding to it. And they really looked like the celebrities that we all know. And it turned out to be a deep fake. And so the law hasn't quite caught up in some ways, in ways that people's images are misused. But I think, again, it comes down to trust and adaptation, as far as the social media ecosystem. And participation. I really think- But you think this is what we see- Of course, it could go further in terms of the technology and deep fakes. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, the technology is just going to keep changing. But what we see, you don't think we're having on the verge of another fundamental change like we had in the '90s and 2000s?"
LO_TLJMgd6l,14576,Anne Applebaum,"And instead, there's rule by law. Rule by law means that the law is what the President decides it is. So instead of having courts that make decisions based on the constitution, instead of having an FBI that investigates people based on whether they think they broke the law, instead you have this personalized and politicized organs of the state. And that is completely un-American, it's completely undemocratic. And again, I imagine in this case, I'm sure there are precedents in American history, for example, in the South, in the 1920s or in the late 19th century. I'm sure we could find at the state level this kind of politicization, Huey Long's Louisiana, for example. But at the federal level we have never seen anything like this, and it is a dramatic shift. And this is, of course, one that, unlike the business stuff, which people are going to feel pretty quickly, it's one that people won't feel immediately, but which has long-term impact on justice, on accountability, on transparency, and on how the government works. And I also have to say, having lived through a version of this in Poland, we had a far-right government for several years, it is going to be very hard to fix. It's very hard to fix. Once you fire all the people who worked for the Department of Justice because they believed in justice and you replace them with people who want to be there because they want to make money or because they're loyal to Donald Trump, it's going to be very hard to bring you back to where you were because who's going to want to work for the Department of Justice anymore once it's a body of politicized-I don't know-time-wasters?"
iK4i0NcpXyw,7297,Jack Goldsmith,"I mean, Hunter Biden wasn't going to affect anyone else's life. Well, I mean, I don't follow these things. There's a claim that Hunter could potentially implicate his father. Well, fair enough. That's true. I don't follow these things, and in fact, though the pardon makes that... Because now I think he loses some of his immunity to testify. But anyway, I haven't studied those claims. I agree. Trump was incomparable in his abuse. Many dozens... And I think Hunter's actually listed all of these and studied them all. I have a chart on this, and I think something like, I can't remember the number, but the person I did it with, we concluded that about 70% of the pardons were for friends or friends of friends. Several of them, as you say, were for people who had been indicted and prosecuted by Mueller and who may have testified against Trump. So he was incomparable in his abuse. I mean, remember, Bill Clinton was investigated after his Marc Rich pardon by the Southern District of New York. Jim Comey actually investigated him, so there was some possible wrongdoing there, but nothing compares to what Trump did in number or abuse. Nothing compares to it. Well, let's look forward, since he's about to become president again in six weeks, and talk generally maybe."
oXK-qWoHA5j,14354,Anne Applebaum,"It's that there's resistance, but then countries start to split up. I mean you can't even imagine it in the US these days, the Civil War was a long time ago, but it does look a lot like the 1850s period. I once read a little bit about, and it comes back to mind now, at some point Illinois and California may have irreconcilable differences with Texas and Florida in terms of how the country should be run. And again, which side the federal government is on then becomes extremely important. But you really do get a question of are laws enforced across the country in an equal way? And who controls which police forces? And we have a complicated federal system, but a pretty good tradition of not having one force fighting another force, but that does happen in countries. It's not like that's never been heard of in human history, right? People don't have enough imagination, I would say, sometimes, in thinking about where this could go, sadly. No, I mean, look, we are really lucky. We're a lucky country. You and I belong to a lucky generation. Yes, I agree. We lived in an era when it felt like democracy was flourishing and spreading. We got used to that idea. Our country became more democratic in our lifetimes."
kAs0PS3rDSz,6374,Tom Tugendhat,"And so it's been really quite something. And I think being with them this year, being in Ukraine this year, being in Kyiv this year was really quite moving as well, because of course it's been a long time since your independence day was marked by anything other than fireworks and celebrations. Well, this year in Kyiv, the gun powder was real. I found myself waking up on independence morning with the air raid sirens going off in Kyiv at five o'clock in the morning and going downstairs into the bomb shelter and then feeling the earth shake. So it's not like the 4th of July, I can tell you that much. And the mood of their government and military and citizens? I mean the resolve is complete. I mean, there's the old expression, armies don't go to war, nations do. Armies just fight battles. Well, the whole of Ukraine is at war, in the sense that if you go anywhere you'll see unbelievable resolve from people. Grandparents and grandchildren are stitching camouflage netting together. Young people are either actually on the front line fighting or they are mobilizing for it. Members of parliament are fighting two days a week, sitting in parliament five days a week, organizing soup kitchens, organizing any number of different logistical elements to make sure the war effort continues."
UTKZP1-BHuz,5848,Invisible Rulers,"We talk a lot about loneliness epidemics and things like this. So the positive vision for what this was supposed to do was to help people find groups. I had a baby in 2013, and it started showing me mom groups. And I actually didn't have very many friends with kids, almost none, in fact, and so it was nice to have that suggestion. A little creepy that it realizes. You post your first picture with an infant and boom, the whole feed changes. It knows immediately everything. But that was what it was for. And the other thing I'll say, for those who aren't immersed in the social media weeds, is that Facebook has, and all of these platforms have... Well, maybe not X anymore, but they have incredible teams of research scientists who work at the company, and they are actually doing research, and you did see leak, some of the Facebook papers that leaked a couple of years later did show that they began to realize that pathways to radicalization were happening as a result of their recommendation engine, that that was what was taking people into these groups, that it was actually the power of suggestion. Because this anti-vaccine group account that I had, as I mentioned, it did not type in the word Pizzagate. It did not type in the word QAnon."
ucSkWxgUvC3,8632,A.B. Stoddard,"And so if there was a way to suspend it for the summer, punt it to the September fight, that's what we all kind of anticipated and that didn't happen. And then at the same time, Kevin McCarthy's strength, and I think he is not a political strategic thinker, and he's blundered in different ways that have really built his reputation. I'm not taking back my criticism of him. But he has outperformed expectations because he is very, very good at what McConnell and Nancy Pelosi are good at, which is the carrot feeding of the individual members, and constant communication with the rank and file about their needs and wants. He doesn't have master strategy in his brain the way that Mitch and Nancy do. He's not a badass in the way they are, he is a bumbler. But something has happened since the 15 rounds of voting for speaker, where he has managed to keep the loudest Freedom Caucus members who were full of threats, quiet. Matt Gaetz is quiet. Chip Roy is quiet. This is an incredible accomplishment. Because he was able to get them around the table to agree on a bill that would increase the debt ceiling. Most had said they wouldn't vote for a bill to even increase the debt ceiling. So they voted for this bill with all their cuts."
jYOE1CeaIME,6553,Larry Summers,"And so you can't really solve both problems. So I think we've done a very large amount of damage, and I tend to be an optimist about the United States. I think there's a lot of resilience. I do note that there has been at the most critical moments, some backing away from these kinds of policies. So we may work our way through this, but only if there's very substantial alarm and very substantial reversal. I think that the seventies is such an interesting analogy, and I thought about it a little before, more in political terms, but combining... I mean one way to think about it, maybe we had the oil shock in '73 basically, and then Nixon at the same time, considerable political instability leading to the resignation of actually Agnew, separate reasons in a way. Agnew then of course Nixon in '74, but that was about a year. I think what everyone thinks of their administrations-Ford and Carter tried to restore a certain kind of normalcy, you might say, to our politics and did to a reasonable degree. Obviously the economics of the rest of the seventies remained choppy to say the least. And it ultimately took whatever it took with Volcker and all this. But one thing that's really striking, leave aside post 2028 and how much of the damage remains, and I think that's a real concern."
ZST8BW1_Ro-,8856,Mark Esper,"But the civilian leadership matters, right? I mean, it also affects who the military leadership is since the civilian leadership appoints ultimately the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders and so forth and promotes generals and all. But just say a little more about that. People don't, I think... They got to think, Pentagon, military, and they forget that there's civilian control. Yeah, it's a mistaken notion. And look, we know why, because the association's Pentagon, military, uniforms, generals, admirals. But most, if not all the power is vested in civilians, and certainly with the Secretary of Defense you have quite a lot of power and authority. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the joint chiefs themselves, the joint staff, they're all advisors. They play a functional role providing a military perspective, a military recommendation to their civilian overseers. So the Undersecretary for Policy, the Undersecretary for Research and Engineering, they have military people on their staff, but as advisors and General Milley was my principal advisor. He was also the principal advisor to the president under the law and the National Security Council. But they have no authority to deploy troops to make contracting decisions, things like that. Now, I don't mean to downplay that because they have a lot of informal authority, but it's important to understand that the power is invested in civilian leaders."
qrMXtnU7XC4,3796,Doug Sosnik,"Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it. He's not going to be exciting. He doesn't need to be exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something happened for a moment, the big point about '68, though, and what happened after was, they changed the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he'd broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would've won. But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC."
HP7nUznPlvc,5967,Larry Summers,"But in financial markets, when prices go down sometimes people get margin calls or forced to de-lever and then they have to sell. And sometimes everybody just gets more scared because prices have gone down and they want to become net sellers. So when falling prices produce net selling, then that produces faster falling prices and more net selling. And the whole thing can spiral very far. And we are not way far from that kind of edge right now. And a sense that we're going to do more of these kinds of things or a misunderstanding, makes it more likely. Europe was a much more brittle place in 1914 than it had been 10 or 15 years before. And therefore events which might otherwise not have been hugely consequential became hugely consequential. And that's in a way to understand the current state of financial markets. It's funny, I was talking to someone last night about a more foreign policy focused discussion. Not so much economic policy, though intersects lot. And 1914 came up and sort of Kaiser Wilhelm thinking he was good at this and not being good at this and making a couple of miscalculations and then one thing leads to another in that dynamic way that the world sometimes takes on, I guess. So two questions about what you said so far related."
05KaSvVf25F,8874,James Carville,"He does not want do it. He's got too much at risk. It's a multiracial female that he's got to go against and Vance is going to have to debate Walz and Walz is going to... Pretty confident in Walz's position. And if I was Walz, I'd say, ""Actually use a sofa to watch television on."" But anyway. But I do think the argument over debates is pretty essential here to keeping Trump off guard. I do. Yeah. Develop that a little bit. Normally these debates about debates are kind of like endless things and then you end up agreeing or whatever. But do you think this is actually important for Harris to emphasize that she wants the debate? Should she actually accept the debate that's different from the ABC one that was originally set up? So here we are and we have a normal conversation... August conversation about debate. It's something we forgot. Something actually happened on June 27th. It actually happened right in front of us. So there's just... Shall we say the debate awareness index is pretty high right now compared to normal? And this is not, ""Let's get Jim Baker and [inaudible] and Frank Fahrenkopf and hammer out the rules yet."" This is not where we are on this. And so you had an originally scheduled, let's say, September 4th, September 10th ABC debate that he's backed out of."
Zee_xOiHo70,9744,James Carville,"But this is more... You can't use a historical benchmark to talk about this because debates have now taken on near legendary status in American politics. Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out. I was thinking about this the other day, and this is not a criticism, I think it's the first ticket in modern times since the modern primary system came into being where both candidates on one ticket, in this case on the Democratic ticket, and neither of them has ever gotten a vote in a Democratic primary for president, that is every race we've all been involved in or watched... In the early days, they only had a few primaries, Humphrey and all that. But still every nominee in both parties had gotten some primary votes, certainly from '72 on. '76 on, let's just say. And mostly had won the primaries. And then the VP nominees had often run and gotten at least some primary votes, especially if they were the losing candidate. Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list."
ZHywTlIcXYq,7224,A.B. Stoddard,"It was not the blowout that everyone said it was going to be. The eight to 10 points in the polls, the 8 million votes. No, no, no. It was in three states. That's how you win the election through the electoral college. And Trump almost won. And so if you think about those voters who they're not tribal, they're not the people that we worry the most about, the most partisan, the most activated, no, these people very well could look at these two guys next November and say, ""Trump, at least he did the job before, and he's nuts, but eggs and gas costs less than, and Biden just looks like he needs to go home."" So his age, I think even if he can make it through the campaign, is a huge liability. And if they're just trying to pass the presidency on to Vice-President Harris, maybe that's the plan, that's strange to me because they know that the voters will be taking her into consideration, which is why they're trying to spotlight her now more and highlight her accomplishments and give her more attention and visibility and praise. But Trump is going to say, ""In a couple of months, sleepy Joe's going to be in the hospital, and we're going to be stuck with Kamala."" And that's crude, but that's what he'll say."
TNlwUzJcx7L,7302,AB Stoddard,"That's actually not true. David Shor, who's the Democrats, maybe the best political, but the data scientist, but the Democrat's best one has just released his findings of the 24 election showing that if reluctant and non-voters showed up, all registered voters showed up, Harris wouldn't have lost by 1.5 points, she would've lost by five because those voters are trending to Trump. So they are in a huge hole, and I understand that in that they're in a really dangerous place. They lose 90% of counties in the election. All seven swing states, they're in a panic. They're grieving, they're smarting, they're spinning in circles. There's no one to bring them together. So I get how crippled they are, but again, between November five and January 20 is a long time to try to pick up the pieces and try to prepare for what Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut did, which was a clear coming attack on the constitutional order from Trump in a second term, completely liberated from his previous constraints. The writing was on the wall, and Murphy just seemed like the only one at the beginning who was prepared to come and talk about this. ""This is why he's letting billionaires do this. He's running a kleptocracy. They're getting rich on a crypto scheme, the family's making whatever they need to make while all these programs are being decimated and vets are being fired and everything."" So he was sort of the only one in the beginning out of the gate being articulate."
I_sH3K5BLou,7470,A.B. Stoddard,"So that's likely what happened. It doesn't look good for their prospects. As the great James Carville said on Conversations with Bill Kristol , the age thing gets worse each week. It doesn't get better. My other slightly heterodox, and it may be an incorrect reason for hoping half a year ago, a year ago for a generational turnover for Biden not to run, even if it's a messy primary, was that people are unhappy with the country. And that's the mood. It's been the mood for quite a while. And it's understandable after the pandemic and everything else and a challenging world and so forth. So the normal argument that look, an incumbent's always better, especially if he doesn't have a primary, which Biden presumably won't, not a serious one, always better to have an incumbent than an open sea, which is in effect what would happen if he were just to step aside. I take that point that incumbents usually win. They don't always win, obviously as we saw with Trump, and as you saw with George H.W. Bush. I served in that administration. And Jimmy Carter, so people overdo a little bit how, and we had a string of three incumbents winning with Clinton, Bush and Obama, and everyone decided that's the nature of things. But they were actually pretty close in some of those elections, at least Bush's in '04."
tnoKbVjS34-,3267,Doug Sosnik,"It was only at the end, after the only debate, the end of October, did they coalesce around Reagan and support him. And it wasn't because Reagan did so well in the debate, and he killed Carter. It was that Reagan did well enough. And so Biden has got to get to a point that he's doing well enough to be able to make the race about Trump. And so at the end of all this, I'd say it's probably a 30/70 ratio. 30% of Biden's message has got to be a positive reason for people to support him. And 70% can be about Trump. But you can't make it a hundred percent about Trump. Talk through, even through these actual presidential campaigns. Let's maybe just bracket the very small chance, I suppose that Biden steps aside, some of us might have urged him to consider that, or the small Trump, the chance that Trump something gets tripped up or by Nikki Haley or by the courts decisively. And so, what are the moments, what do you look for now over the next, how many months are we away? I kind of lost track. Eight months, something like that. Yeah, we're almost nine months away. And the longest general election in modern political history, we'll have over 60% of the country doesn't want to see either one of these people run."
JvyMrmpRU3-,14823,Anne Applebaum,"And I think, by the way, that's a surprise for Europeans too. I mean, everybody has this image of Americans. We believe in freedom and we're cowboys and we fight for what we believe and so on. And to see just one by one by one serious people with a lot of power, billionaires and US senators, kind of caving and letting stuff happen that they know is wrong, they must know it's wrong, is amazing. And I think I didn't appreciate how few barriers this Trump assault would take. I knew the assault was coming, but I assumed there would be more resistance. By resistance, I know that there are people protesting. I know that there are a number of Democrats in the house and in the Senate who have been brave and open, and of course all the great Democratic governors and so on. I'm not saying that there's... What surprises me is the rich people. And a Republican senator is a serious figure. You have 200 employees and a job for six years and an enormous amount of status. And why would someone like that cave to someone like Donald Trump whom they know is breaking the law and they know is taking power away from Congress. I mean, this to me is really mysterious. We saw some of it in his first term and actually should say, I even wrote about it."
snyQKnwqQL2,2310,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Mexican immigration officials are setting arrest records nearly every month and blocking migrants from getting to the US-Mexico border at the scale that they had been for a lot of the last few years. Add to that the fact that the United States has built up an enormous amount of infrastructure at the border. There's half a dozen soft-sided detention facilities to hold people, more capacity to process people rapidly through the asylum system, and the Biden administration itself changed the practices by which the asylum processes carried out for migrants crossing the border in June of last year. And the result of this is that border crossings are currently lower than they were at the time when President Biden took office. And in November, we actually hit a bit of a milestone, possibly for the first time ever in US history, more people were processed legally at ports of entry seeking asylum there than were apprehended crossing the border illegally. So President Trump will take office with the border quieter than it has been in four years and with the tools in place, should he keep the diplomatic issues going with Mexico, to potentially keep numbers lower. Can I just ask one thing? Just listening to you, it strikes me that often the border is described, and I myself have this vague impression of it's sort of irresistible, these forces, people want to come."
wm0GTRZr06S,13150,Anne Applebaum,"They're horrified by the language that comes out of the administration, whether it's from Vance or from the people talking about tariffs. I mean, the tariffs are a background to this story too. And they're aware that this shift is of such scale and of such importance that they need to coordinate in a way that they hadn't ever felt they needed to do before. I mean, nobody ever before thought of the United States as an antagonist. I mean, people didn't like, plenty of people were anti-American or they didn't like the Americans, or they were annoyed by them or they disagreed with their policies. But the idea that the United States might be an antagonist, a country that is seeking to undermine Europe, or break up the European Union, or damage NATO, or damage the security of European states, this is brand new and everyone is still getting used to it. I mean, some friends of mine get annoyed when the Europeans are so nice to Trump. It does have a slightly deleterious effect, frankly, on those of us in the US trying to warn people about how bad and alarming Trump is because of course it cuts the other way. I always say what you said, and I think it is right: they have actual responsibilities running a country, and they have to do what they think is right in terms of not only their own country, and that's obviously important, but also in terms of helping it, really helping Ukraine."
sBjSz5a4szZ,9151,Robert Kagan,"Right, right. The Democratic Party could not repudiate the Klan. And so all that's happening, and Americans are capable of living in a society where that kind of prejudice is rampant. And I think that we just think that we grew out of it. And I think this is where we just can't imagine that people are still like that. And I think that to me, that's the big problem that we face intellectually, which is liberals, and I think we are all product of the Enlightenment to some extent, and we have this idea of inevitable progress. And we have this idea that human beings, over time... this is sort of the Frank Fukuyama thesis, which, Frank is hardly alone in feeling this way, that over time people will understand what liberalism requires. They'll become liberal. They'll realize that their prejudices are misplaced, et cetera, et cetera. I think the reality is different. I think the reality is that very few people really changed their mind that much. And there are always groups that feel the way that people who supported the Klan did, but they're oppressed or repressed or suppressed in various different ways. By Civil War, by... Eisenhower had to send the troops to Little Rock. The south was in full rebellion after Brown v. Board of Education, 1954."
QCLQ3t6XwBm,15683,Anne Applebaum,"I think a reaction has begun against Trump and against Musk. And a lot of it is just based on more common sense, what are they doing with the government and why are they treating people this way? My cousin works for the government and the government has a little bit of fat, sure, but we can't treat public employees this way. Some of it's just that, and some of it is actual policies, they're going to cut Medicaid and so forth. And then some of it is Ukraine, I think. And both the more the sympathy for Ukraine, quite Ukraine, and some of it is the broader point you just made very well. So I think there will be... I don't think the odds are that great that Trump and Musk are going to be wildly popular in two or three years. Their policies aren't going to work, I don't think, at home or abroad. But is the damage they do so great that at that point it becomes very hard to put the pieces back together? I think that's both the problem here... And maybe more so in foreign policy because the infrastructure is more fragile, so to speak, don't you think, in the world order than it is here at home. Well, we'll see. I mean, as I said, some of this is so new to people."
hVr6IdwxQNC,5861,Tim Snyder,"And what we did, we did on false pretenses. And so that's meant that we lost a lot of credibility with our own people and then also with others. And so then you come around to a situation like Ukraine. I mean, it's kind of like a fairy tale, right? It's like the crying wolf or something. You come around to a situation where the wolf really is there. And the situation actually is really simple because that's the thing about Ukraine, which is unusual, is it's both its strategic and its moral simplicity. And people don't want to think that it's simple. They want to think, ""Oh, wait, somehow this is part of a conspiracy, or this is somehow Vietnam or Iraq or somehow,"" but it's actually, it's not really like those situations. It's a country which is defending itself, and we're kind of helping on the margin, which is a good thing. But we haven't really been in that situation before. There aren't that many situations where democracies are defending themselves, right? I mean, Great Britain in 1940. Yeah, Britain in 1940 is for me, as this war began, has been going on for me, is the one that just stands out. Yeah, right. I mean, there's Czechoslovakia in '38 where the democracy should have helped, but didn't, and then there's Britain in '40 where we should have, and we did."
Dyd5v9NnqSK,3532,Doug Sosnik,"And so as a result of that, it's really hard to break the tectonic plates of everyone being dug in. So back to your question, I would say the things I would watch are, one is the economy, and first of all whether it improves. And I think people have a different view on that today than you might've had on Monday based on the last round of inflation numbers that came out. So the first though is the economy: does it improve, continue to improve, people continue be able to register in polling that they feel more confident about the economy? And then lastly of course on that is whether Biden gets any credit for that. So that's one issue. Second is the external events, and I do believe using the October 7th invasion and the follow-up that it has had a significant political impact politically for Biden for the negative. Third would be on Trump. I think it's a combination of what happens in the legal process, if anything. And the polling does show he is convicted of a crime before the election, it does have an impact in the outcome. And secondly, it's just Trump himself personally. Actually, he's not out very much, by the way. The very little secret is he's got his own 2020 basement strategy."
okWQmPK2qDR,5906,Tom Tugendhat,"And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people. This is a guy who has behaved like a mafia don on a global scale. It's quite extraordinary how violent he's been and yet how ignored he's been as well by so many. It's been seen as a distraction or as noise. It's not, it's a genuine threat by a person who has been at war with us for the best part of 15 years. And we've been treating it as though he's a mosquito buzzing around the room. He's not, he's actually trying to bring down our system, he's trying to undermine our democracy and he's trying to erode our freedom. And we've been ignoring it. Well, I've been calling it out for five years and it's only in the last six months that I finally got the level of support that I think has been necessary throughout. And so I'm very sorry it has required the invasion, of the attack on Kyiv to do it, but I'm very glad that we've finally woken up. So I think that this is a huge change. Well, let's talk about that for a minute and get back to Ukraine itself and the situation on the ground, but that's important."
EMIKCBGqLot,9386,A.B. Stoddard,"But what struck me about the CNN Town Hall was that his lies, they were coming so fast and he wasn't the least bit sheepish about them. And it's a tool for dominance. We've watched him now, it's my eighth year of watching this up close, and it definitely has changed. He lies more and more loudly and more rapidly in a setting like that. And he is the president, and he creates his own reality. And if you want to try to drop in there and correct him, you're just like a gnat on the windshield. You're just going to get run over and 'see ya.' So it was both a great night for him and it was truly terrifying, I thought. Yeah, I mean, that's so well said. Because when you read up on authoritarians in the past and on con men, two categories that Trump probably fits in pretty well, they get better at it. I mean, I thought in 2015 I think Trump said these outrageous things and these lies, and you could tell he was a little uncertain like, ""Can I get away with this exactly?"" And I don't know if you could tell, maybe I'm reading stuff in retrospectively, but he seemed a little more tentative, let's say. And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all..."
xYRIj1riAkm,2558,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So we do expect to see a significant drop in family-based immigrant visas, especially for immediate relatives of US citizens because that is a category that is impacted heavily by bans. And we also expect that as the system becomes more expensive and more difficult and more filled with red tape, fewer people will apply for visas or we're going to get a shift in the composition of who comes here. They want richer people. As Trump said, he wants white people from Norway and they're going to be imposing some changes in the system to make it more difficult for people around the rest of the world to get visas, though the overall numbers may not change that much in a lot of categories simply because there are so many people in line that even if you disqualify half of all people who are currently waiting, it would take years and years before you actually saw a reduction in the numbers. And H-1B finally. Maybe H-1B, H-2B. We've had this little debate with Musk and Bannon and so forth, the intra-Trump-world debate. How do you think that turns out? Do we still have...? Trump still gets his immigrants to be gardeners at Mar-a-Lago on the H-2B visa and Musk still gets people to work at Tesla on H-1B visas?"
JpG60WZ40SG,6130,Tom Tugendhat,"And it's a big country, and China's more of a threat."" And so where do you think we are on the sort of Putin question generally, as you would see in terms of what you would take to be a sound understanding of it, of him and of it? Well, look, I mean your point about they choose not to press charges, of course it depends where you are. I mean, if you're in Estonia, your decision as to whether or not you wish to press charges is very different than if you're in Germany or France or Washington, right? I mean, each mile you get further from the Russian border, your confidence grows. Right. But the reality is, in recent years, it was about a decade ago, the Russians kidnapped an Estonian border guard whose offense was to be guarding the Estonian border and being on the Estonian side of it. But he was kidnapped and he's still held in a prison in Moscow. I mean, it's absolute, it's criminal kidnapping. If you look at what's going on in Ukraine today, thousands of children, quite literally thousands of children are being taken from Ukraine to Russia and being adopted, given up for adoption, and their pasts being hidden and masked so that these young children will grow up not knowing where they're from or who they are."
NbT9cNsvOjc,2674,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah, so starting with that second one, I think one major inflection point is going to be reconciliation, is how much money does the enforcement apparatus get? And if they get these staggering sums of money, the likes of which have never been spent before in immigration enforcement, that is an inflection point. That is not something where the short-term implications would be significant, but the medium and long-term implications would be dramatic. In the short- term, will the country look different? I think enforcement will be a lot more visible. There will be a lot more situations like with Bakersfield where you see people out in the community and ICE is going and boarding buses, border patrol is boarding buses. They did this in the first Trump term. There was a bit of a scandal where they were just boarding random Greyhounds and Greyhound eventually had to say like, ""Hey, please don't do that. You're scaring off our customers."" We're going to see a lot more stuff like that. And so I think there will be a change in the perception of immigration enforcement with especially a lot of conservative media organizations using any raid, anything to sort of say, ""The change has happened."" And so, I think the message being sent from the White House is that, ""A change has happened, we are now back in control."" And how much people buy that will really depend on how these are carried out."
_oiwDW4dhJt,9932,James Carville,"I am struck how much people just assume it's going to happen because Trump said he would do it. I assume Trump won't do it if he thinks it not in his interest. He said he was going to testify to trial. [Inaudible] he thought that. And you know what? When he didn't testify, it didn't cost him anything. There was very little... even, ""well sir, you said..."" so he'll say... he's already said, ""CNN can't host, they're not fair."" He's just going to brush it off and say, ""It can't be fair. I told Biden to take a drug test. He wouldn't take a drug test."" My answer would be, ""Will you give us the records that Keith Schiller stole from Dr. Bornstein in 2017 that no one's ever asked you about it? You went in his office, the doctor said he felt like he was raped, sent your goons in there and be glad to, you release those health records."" But he doesn't pay. He's paid zero price for not testifying his own path. None. And from that, he's learned, I can do what I want. I can back out of a debate. What are they going to do to me? I mean, do you think though that Biden literally every day for the next month just says, in the course of discussing whatever issue he's discussing, ""I very much look forward to debating Donald Trump on this."
W7oOsyQ9-0e,3730,David Axelrod,"Exactly. I don't know, I was actually not that upset about the Bible and all that Lee Greenwood stuff, but I was talking with someone about it, and he doesn't follow politics that much, but he's smart, he said, ""Look, that's just Trump. Of course, everyone knows he's a huckster and a grifter. You can scream and yell about that, but there's not one voter who doesn't know that, including Trump voters, they know that's what he does. But at the end of the day, what's he doing? People are voluntarily spending $60, maybe foolishly, on a King James Bible."" Cheaper than the gym shoes. Yeah, with American documents attached. But that's not an effective argument against him. At the end of the day, oh, fine, he's marketing Bibles. Other people sell... There's a way in which we all... We, but a certain type of... A lot of people in the media, I'd say, really want to go after him on the cultural signifiershttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Yeah. ...and not so much on, as you say, the bread and butter issues. Well, even, I recoil from, after this last weekend, everybody's hair was on fire because he, except Jon Stewart, he had a great bit on this last night, because some guy had on his bumper somehttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Biden. ...phonied-up artwork of Biden bound in the back of his truck."
pOMIFQWEZN-,8947,Mark Esper,"And I said... I was playing Trump, President Trump, and I said, ""I think I'll just remove my Secretary of Defense. I think I also remove Bill Barr just to have those two agencies a little more under my direct control without the kinds of limits that you and Bill Barr would... the kinds of things you would not do that he might want to do."" And everyone said on... this was on Zoom, it was during the pandemic. Everyone said, ""Oh, bill, it's imaginative of you. Of course that'll never happen. But I mean, that was kind of clever of you to think of that."" So there you go. Anyway, Mark, thanks for joining me and thank you for your service, honestly, to the nation. Oh, thank you. My privilege. And I noticed in quickly researching your career, and you were confirmed as Secretary of Defense, 90 to eight. That's impressive. That doesn't happen all the time these days. Yeah, not bad for my third year. I remember President Trump saying, and I write about this in my book, he said, ""Yeah, 90 to 8, 90 to 8, should I be concerned that you got that many votes from Republicans and Democrats?"" And I just looked at him and smiled. Yeah, that's probably wise. A lot of them knew you had served in senior positions in the Bush administration and then on the Hill for Senator Frist and stuff."
asoiSkfVJnr,6457,Aaron Friedberg,"And some of them are completely different. Some of them really are isolationists, and I don't think anyone can say with assurance if there are such groups, which one is going to emerge dominant. And I think there are some reasons to think that the second of the two would probably in the end win out because I think they are probably closer to what Trump himself actually believes. And I think Vance makes that much more likely. I think Vance's pick, whether Trump attended it this way or not, means he'll be there if Trump wins, as vice president. And he really seems to believe in America First, and I assume will insist that America First types populate most of the key positions of the administration. And Trump will insist that people who go along with him on January 6th get first crack, not the people who voted to certify the election. You put those two things together, you do end up, I think with an America, much more of an America First administration, a much less of a Reagan Republican administration. Yes. And I don't think we're going to see the cycling through more traditional figures who will then get fired or quit after six months, 12 months, 18 months. It just doesn't seem like that's likely for one thing because most of those people have been eliminated."
VgykkkhNPyZ,8273,A.B. Stoddard,"That's amazing, isn't it? Like he was enjoying the fact that, if he could tank the economy and on Biden's watch, that it's no sweat off his. So it was one of the low moments of the night, and there were many. Yeah, but that's such a revealing one. I'm glad, I don't know if I'm glad, we call it closer to that. But it's appropriate to... Because it is so, I mean it's utterly shameless. You shouldn't be able to say that. Which is literally saying, of course if I'm president, I can't tank the economy. If Biden's president, who cares? Let him pay a massive political price. We'll just blame him. But just, as what is, and what do we call that? Saying the quiet thing out loud, or whatever? That's what Trump does. But I don't know. He's paid no price, right? And in some ways people think, yeah, that's right. That's why we need to have him as president again. Because when he is president, we won't have this crisis. Oy. Any last thoughts that we haven't covered? We've covered a lot. But I guess, just final. So, if we get back together in, you know, Christmas, or at the end of this year, of this calendar year, debt ceiling will be big, I suppose. Possible government shutdown, and where we end up on that in September."
JB1TX8Rm80r,7341,AB Stoddard,"The next week it's Mark Cuban. The week after that it's, I don't know somebody but maybe five numbers. This is how much money Elon has made from the government since January 20. These are the free speech violations and due process violations from this last week alone. This is the total since January. This is the price of eggs. These are the market losses since Trump took over. This is how much money his family's making in crypto. These are the valuable programs that have been cut, and this is how many vets have been fired. I mean, that's not hard. I applaud Booker, but I feel like there's just so much more obvious stuff they could be doing to spread a message about how dangerous this is and how many promises Trump has made that he's just completely breaking. He's not even trying to pretend that he's going to fulfill them. They do overthink everything is my sense. I've spoken to a few groups of Democrats in the last month or two, and it's, we have to decide on this issue. We have to do kitchen table, we can't do this. They can do a lot of things that a lot of different people can do a lot of different things and they speak to different constituencies. It's a very big country and the business types who care about tariffs or consumers who care about tariffs are different from the people who have relatives who have temporary protected status or who know people very well who have temporary protected status."
hW47C4B7Et9,3718,David Axelrod,"That was a very simple comparative that starts with Trump bragging about being the guy who brought down Roe versus Wade and Biden narrating talking about-which is a good thing-talking about his commitment to abortion rights and his trust in women. It's a very, very effective spot. I think that's a prototype for, it's a template for what they should be doing from here to the end. Donald Trump should be in the narrative from here to the end. Interesting. And which aspect? Well, let's pivot to Trump. I mean, there's so many things we can go after, obviously on Trump, his personal character, the lies, the January 6th, his actual policies, things he did in the first term, things he's promising to do, which are scarier in my opinion in the second term. He also wants to destroy NATO and is pro-Putin, I mean, how do you juggle all- Deport Bill Kristol. What's that? Deport Bill Kristol, I think is one. That tests well, unfortunately. Biden probably shouldn't feature that. Which aspects do you feature? The kind of the policy side, the personality side? Yeah. I think the temptation is to focus on just morality, ethics, democracy, and so on. But I keep saying to people, if you're speaking, I feel deeply about it. You feel deeply about it."
BApxnDvIWY_,9123,A.B. Stoddard,"And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you're a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new liberal friends are, ""well, he can't get away with this. This lie is even worse,"" but I think they underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it... The open mic night is a great line of Mike's, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn't that bad last time. Then you say, ""Well, the reason he wasn't that bad if he wasn't was because he had 19 different constraints, both individuals and institutional constraints that won't exist in a second term,"" but no one of course is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn't stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think? I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary?"
NL0HUDhMKev,6187,Jack Goldsmith,"And there was another one that just came out yesterday from the Inspector General of the Justice Department, and we can talk, if you want, about which of the prosecutions and investigations were legitimate or not. But in any event, we've been in this downward spiral, and again, I'm going to use that phrase a lot, because it's been happening in a lot of contexts, of one administration investigating another, prosecuting another, going back to the Obama administration investigating the Trump campaign, which I think they had reasons to be concerned, but they made a lot of mistakes along the way, which got this whole ball rolling. And then, there was the Mueller investigation and then, there were investigations by the Barr Justice Department about the Mueller investigation and John Durham. And then, the Biden people come in and they start investigating the last administration. And now, Trump's coming in threatening to go after people, for which... who have not plausibly committed crimes and don't warrant investigation. I can't say that about everyone, but the vast majority of the people he's mentioned. This is the thing I worry about the most. It would be wonderful, and this is naive, it's going to seem naive, it would be wonderful if they meant what they said when they said they're going to stop the lawfare."
zbJp9W-MmEw,8927,Mark Esper,"I had a good relationship with Gina Haspel. So many of our service members, our special operations command in particular, worked with her people, a lot of intelligence sharing. So it was a very, very close relationship there. As you said, with Mike Pompeo, he and I went to West Point together. We were classmates, have a lot of mutual friends. He and I knew each other beforehand. I kind of knew where he came from. I knew what his true north was, his azimuth, and so we got along really well, a lot of cooperation between DOD. Bill, you know the history of this pretty well. More often than not, there were bad relations between DOD and State. You go back to the Weinberger days as notable, but Mike and I got along really well. There were times he would do things that would help out DOD immensely, maybe at the expense of State and vice versa. But I thought that was another very important partnership where he and I could have candid discussions, worked well together, came in particularly handy during the attacks in late December 2019 against the Shia militia groups, and then, of course, the killing of Soleimani. I'm always reminded of when our embassy was under siege, Mike Pompeo calling me up and saying, ""Look, I need help here and here."" I said, ""Mike, you got it."
DZwC9GxwQ32,3606,David Axelrod,"I rubber stamp David's decisions, but that's what board members are for, of course. Most importantly, for this conversation, obviously, and most famously the top campaign strategist and President Barack Obama's-Senator Obama's-2008 campaign for the presidency, and then his successful reelection in 2012, which is really what I want to focus on today. I guess you ran the most recent successful reelection campaign in America. Yeah. We came to take for granted that presidents would be reelected. We had a string of reelections. George W. Bush got reelected. I guess you were involved in an unsuccessful reelection. Thanks. Yeah. I was the one exception in the Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama streak. They needed me to come into the George H.W. Bush White House to break that to me. Yeah, Carter in there, but Nixon got reelected and then curtailed, but we had a period of time when there was tremendous advantage to being an incumbent president, and we'll see if that holds. In this election, we have this unusual situation where we have basically two presidents running against each other. Right now, I think you're seeing the advantages and disadvantages of incumbency at the same time. Biden's raising a lot of money. The bully pulpit that you and I used to talk about has been sort of fractionated, so it's not what it was."
xXOnoEi0L_e,5924,Aaron Friedberg,"The paths are more divergent than typically has been the case and a choice between, again, Kerry and Bush or whatever you want, Carter and Dole, even the Cold War choices really. But you make a very good point about Trump himself and his administration itself being uncertain. But maybe say a word also about just the choice in November in the sense of, I mean, Harris and Trump, they are, I mean, we should say, just say a word if you wish, about uncertainty about Harris too. But the basic thrusts of those two foreign policies would be pretty different now. I think so. I have in my mind a picture of two sort of branches. So there's Trump on the one side, there's Harris on the other, and each of those branches has two sub-branches underneath. So there's Trump and there's Trump with a dominant influence of a more, I don't know, traditional Republican foreign defense policy, perhaps driven by some of the characters that I've mentioned. And then there's Trump with these other people who would be pushing for a set of policies that would be really radically different and might continue some of the themes that Trump raised at least even if he didn't get to the point of actually implementing them fully in his first administration."
YGY8CPXCjaf,8667,James Carville,"Just remember all of that. And Tim Walz is just an antidote against all of that kind of stuff. But we'll see. You should have a good convention. You'd have to really, really screw this up to have a bad one. You got too much going for you. But as you say, that's for all that we know her, she's not really well known. So you have the standard challenge, but also opportunity of a challenger of a way. I mean, we'll come to Trump in a minute, but he's kind of the incumbent in this scenario, it seems to me4. And she's the less well- known challenger who has to define herself. Correct. And Walz is a very little-known VP pick. He hasn't run for president himself the way other have or so forth. So it's a pretty undefined ticket, I'd say as these things go, which is both could be good or bad, right? Yeah. And you got a chance to definition. What is the definition you put on this? Okay. You're exactly right. It goes back to the original point. She's not really that well known. And the first person to grab a paintbrush and start painting is going to be the memory. And we have a shot because it could be hard for them to break through."
vhl7P8GJ8YP,13699,Anne Applebaum,"And I also have to say, having lived through a version of this in Poland, we had a far-right government for several years, it is going to be very hard to fix. It's very hard to fix. Once you fire all the people who worked for the Department of Justice because they believed in justice and you replace them with people who want to be there because they want to make money or because they're loyal to Donald Trump, it's going to be very hard to bring you back to where you were because who's going to want to work for the Department of Justice anymore once it's a body of politicized-I don't know-time-wasters? So, you're cutting out a whole class of people, a generation of people who worked for the government out of civic- mindedness, and you're replacing them with people who are working out of venality, and it is going to be very hard to bring the civic-minded people back. This, I've seen happen, here and elsewhere. All that is to me, deeply disturbing. I think you might also want to spend a minute thinking about the difference between how ICE is being created, the new ICE, as opposed to how the FBI was originally created back in beginning of the last century. The FBI, which has been a very flawed institution, this is not an advertisement for FBI, but from the beginning it was meant to be the people who were recruited for it were told they were civil servants."
nUrn2PQkrvQ,8589,A.B. Stoddard,"Intuitively, I just feel that he might not be on the ticket in November of 2024. I don't like saying that, but I always believed it was untenable for him to run, and now he's running, and I still think it's untenable. Even if his health holds up, let's hope it does, of course, and that he sticks to his determination, how much of a problem do you think it is that, fairly or unfairly, his vice-president, there is some chance of her having to assume greater responsibilities or even take over obviously in a second term? And how much is the fact that she doesn't seem terribly to have had a very successful vice presidency, again, fairly or unfairly, that's the appearance, how much of a problem is Harris as the running mate to Biden? So I think him staying on the ticket and just limping to the finish line is a problem because I think that for a lot of Americans, Bill, they don't follow politics at all, and they can be decisive in these elections. 45,000 votes, fewer than 45,000 separated Trump and Biden in 2020. It was not the blowout that everyone said it was going to be. The eight to 10 points in the polls, the 8 million votes. No, no, no. It was in three states."
pxoWSFa3joM,4519,David Axelrod,"He's an effective demagogue and he's a good entertainer, in his own way, and I agree with you, he's in a way a little crazier than he was, but he is also better, in some ways, at being a demagogue than he was, because he's really discovering what works. He's good. Listen, no one should underestimate Donald Trump. That's always been my keep. He's a feral genius- Yeah. ...that is very, very clear. And even the stuff that we're all... I'm appalled that he put a target on the judge's daughter's back over the weekend and published her photograph, because there are crazy people out there. I'm worried about another Paul Pelosi situation- Yeah. ...where someone is motivated by all of this. That said, what he's doing is he is doing what he always does. He knows that he is at risk of being convicted in this trial in New York, and he's branding it. He's branding the whole event as a partisan, as he would call it, witch hunt and so on, and he's just going to do that relentlessly, just as he did by the way he branded the 2020 election in advance. Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months."
fdWp3XalO5B,6850,Jack Goldsmith,"The Federal Advisory Committee Act is designed to govern just this situation. It has rules about, again, depending on the role that Musk plays, it has rules about transparency, conflict of interest, organization. I'm confident they're going to try to structure this in a way that circumvents this statute. There's an old Scalia opinion in the OLC that says the statute's unconstitutional. Not clear who can sue, but there have been lawsuits before. But I predict that's going to be... I'm sure the Trump people are working hard to exploit the loopholes. And there are some loopholes, but there's law governing that and there will be constraints on how they do that. And on the other hand, you're right, there are ways that the president surely can ensure that Musk gets the information he wants and can come to the conclusions that he wants. And Musk won't have any authority to implement anything, but the president can or the president can try to. I wouldn't underestimate how hard it's going to be. There are lots of rules about changing the administrative state, and maybe if I could do... This is actually an important distinction. No, this is important, so please spend some time on this, yeah. So this is an important distinction that doesn't get talked about enough. So most people think about reforming the administrative state in the kind of Reagan sense of pulling back the regulations, deregulating through changing the nature of the regulations."
iPVcFelFSjR,7388,AB Stoddard,"Getting them through I think also gave him another shot in the arm. Daring to nominate them was bold, but then I don't know, maybe he sort of thought deep down one or two won't make it, but I'll show that I tried. Getting them all through and then Musk, I guess is the other wild card that showed up. So anyway, don't you think that somehow all of this together-feel free to disentangle or correct my entanglement there-but has just put us in a very different place than even we thought we might be. I think on November 5th, Right. I would look at three things. So I think that the one thing those of us at The Bulwark who were predicting doom were definitely only caught off guard by the Elon factor. We knew that loyalists would come in and replace people of expertise and integrity and ethics, and it would be filled with people who were nihilists and inexperienced and just only loyal to Trump, ready to trample parts of the government without a second thought in service to his whims. Also, and this was, I tried to make this clear as much as I could in 2024, whether in things I wrote or in speeches I gave, pre-pardoned so that they could carry out any illegal or unconstitutional order."
ofIoWFgEm_y,6514,Jack Goldsmith,"It's a complicated set of legal moves. It might take a year. It involves some hard legal questions about Article II, but we can talk about that later if you want. The other side of the story is that Trump is trying to get in 50,000 more loyalists, not just so that he can ensure that his programs get implemented that he ran on, but to do other things, corrupt things, things that benefit him personally. Things that are on the line between corruption and non-corruption, that's the worry and I think it's too early to assess. I mean, I guess, one could be pessimistic based on some of the things he said, but I do think it's important to understand that the fight over the civil service is not a brand new fight. Republicans have long been, especially, but not just Republicans, trying to exercise more political control over top officials because they feel stymied by the bureaucracy in implementing their plans and I just think it's important to keep that in mind. No, fair enough. And yeah, a lot depends on what you... Is this just to implement policies the president has the right to implement? We should come to Congress in a minute since we haven't even mentioned Congress, which probably has some checking and oversight roles."
JqR8ZTYABv-,8418,James Carville,"Do you have any view on both what Trump's going to do and should do? It's one of the few things that's going to happen this summer that's actually different. What he's going to do on what? The vice presidential pick for Trump. My own view is probably Doug Burgum. Yeah, that's kind of been my view, too. We haven't even talked about that. Yeah. He doesn't do anything. And I guess his Pence pick was a little... I think Pence might've helped him a little bit. It did give him a little patina of credibility with these evangelical voters and... Look, I read a Washington Post story about him offering these energy companies $1 billion dollars... if they raise $1 billion dollars, they can write his plan. I don't know. That's not typical. That's not normal. ""Oh, it happens all the time."" Actually, I never have seen a presidential candidate offer to let them write their own regulations, their own bill if they raised $1 billion for him? No, I don't think that happens all the time. You and I have seen a lot in Washington. I don't think we've ever seen that, nor anything remotely like that. I've certainly said, ""Well, we'll certainly be very considerate and understand a lot of the issues you have are concerns that we share."
zoRD_lh1zxE,14595,Anne Applebaum,"Some of those parties are flirting with or experimenting with MAGA techniques. So they're watching what works in America and they're seeking to bring those tactics to Europe. So you see some of that too sometimes successfully and sometimes not. I mean, I think the Nigel Farage's party in the UK is trying that. In Poland, we have a party that, a kind of far-right party, which is also seeking to do the same. You can see some, in some cases, direct imitation. And of course, the degree to which those parties have influence and power, they are dangerous, both for European solidarity around Ukraine. They're also dangerous for the persistence of and power of European institutions. I mean, Europe functions when its leaders are most in agreement. And I think we may well get, later in the next year or two, we may well get new kinds of ... I mean, they're already talking about a coalition of the willing, so the group of European leaders who came to Washington speak of themselves as a ""coalition of the willing."" So they're not NATO, they're not the EU, they're a new thing. And I expect that to last and to become a way of doing business. I mean, okay, Viktor Orbán doesn't want to join us or, I don't know, some newly elected leader somewhere else gets cold feet."
IrjpjhmYTeH,14764,Anne Applebaum,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome to Conversations . Very pleased to be joined again by my friend and someone who I have highest regard for an analyst of all things, what, Russian, European, Soviet back in the old days, and American, and unfortunately authoritarianism, which has become more and more of an important thing to be a student and analyst of. Anne Applebaum, this is I think our fifth conversation, our most recent one was six months ago. I just looked back at the transcript. It really stands up very well, I would say. But throughout, you've been more hopeful that Ukraine could hold its own against Russia than I think conventional wisdom had it. And I think that's been correct. You've been more convinced that Europe might really step up a little more than most people here thought, at least in the US. And I think that was right. And you've also been very worried about authoritarianism here in the US, and that's certainly unfortunately becoming very much a concern that was well founded. So anyway, thank you for joining us today. We'll talk about all those topics and update people, even if we can't entirely cheer them up. Well, thanks for having me. Always pleasure to talk to you, whether in real life or via Zoom. No, both are good."
YU6veW8ZpQl,3900,Doug Sosnik,"Now, this was over 30 years ago, I wrote a speech in the summer of '95 about the phases of the election that, I gave that same speech for 15 months. Because the phases were the phases, they never change. It's a little harder in this environment to do that. I haven't thought a great deal about this. But, the way I would look at this in terms of tranches or phases that I would want to try to control if I were in the White House is, we'll have the... You mentioned Super Tuesday. I don't know what the date will be, but sometime probably in early to mid-March, there'll be the consensus that the election, general election is starting. It's the formality, there's no Nikki Haley, there's whatever. So, we're going to have a... This is the beginning of the election early morning, that's one phase. I guess I would probably make a second phase maybe to early June or something like that, roughly, mid-June. And that's really, I think, we'll know where the court stuff is with Trump. I think we're going to have a pretty good idea where the economy is headed towards September and election day at that point. And so, we'll move into the summer with the Republican Convention and the Democratic Convention. It's sort of a second phase."
o9R9Nj5Rgwd,17948,Anne Applebaum,"Buying certain kinds of American products or big investments, investing in American defense technology, by accepting the dominance of American tech companies. All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another. And really very suddenly all that looks different. And I can't tell you right now exactly what the implications will be or whether it can be reversed by further actions down the line. I mean, I suspect among other things that Putin doesn't really want to end the war. And so, I don't know exactly what the... I still have no idea what Trump is talking about when he says the war will end this week or it'll end by May. I'm not sure what he means. But all those things suddenly begin to look different. And the conversations happen in all kinds of contexts. So in boardrooms, in government offices, everyone who deals with the United States in any context is suddenly saying, ""Wait, are all the assumptions that I've based 30 years of decisions on or 80 years of decisions on, are all those assumptions wrong?"" And again, maybe this is going to be reversed and maybe it's not going to be as extreme as people think."
_kHFYLnWoGD,8869,A.B. Stoddard,"So, first of all, I totally agree with you about early stumbles can really help the maturation of a presidential campaign and candidate. And the reset can turn the whole ship around. I think in the case of Ron DeSantis, because he just basically also doesn't seem to have much personality, if you combine the fact that he has the too-tight-shoe look on his face and doesn't really love hanging around with people, which John McCain ultimately did. I mean, once you got him into the diner or into the town hall, even if he was grumpy on the way out to the car, he really liked talking with people. So if you combine that with the fact that he hasn't figured out his way to defeat Trump. When you run, this is the most surreal presidential primary where you have everyone saying, ""Oh, he is the best president we've ever had. But I don't know, I guess I'm in this primary in case he has a heart attack or gets indicted."" I mean, the indictments, first of all, I don't think he'll be prosecuted before election day. And I don't think there's a jury that would convict him in this country. Because I think there always will be an outlier among the jurors. And then I just think Ron DeSantis, we've seen him in a jam after the Stormy Daniels...."
MVa-fKSz8dH,3647,Doug Sosnik,"And you had 40 governments in 40 years and they were like, ""Okay, we had 40 governments in 40 years. But life went on and nothing really changed."" And I think we're unfortunately getting a little bit like that in America. And there's much less enthusiasm and energy, by the way, for this 2024 election than there was in the 2022 election. And I think you're going to see turnout down, turnout's been high for the last four or five election cycles, and I think you're going to see turnout go down. You're seeing viewership on every metric about politics going way down, whether it's watching cable television, subscribing to newspapers, tuning into debates. And the other thing though, which is I think really dangerous, is elections used to be about issues and choices and you elect someone and then they implement whatever they ran on. The issues that are going to decide this election and the implications of whether it's a Trump presidency or Biden presidency in terms of tax policy and of a whole host of issues, they're not talking about the issues that are meaningful in terms of people's lives and what's going to happen when someone wins the election. And so there's really not so much of a ballot test on the substantive direction of our country as it is the context of an evenly divided country, largely based on tribal politics in which education is the best predictor."
ikUgezeOTYD,7973,Robert Kagan,"I mean it's not in a straight line, it's not even, this is the more moderate version of the triumphal liberalism thesis that it is not a straight line, we're grown-ups, we know that there can be setbacks and reverses and reactions, but ultimately, ultimately history goes in this direction. But it was a close-run thing that it ended up going in the direction it did with FDR and with World War II and not going in the Henry Ford America first direction, isn't that right, either in domestic or foreign policy? Look, I mean the founders set up... the Declaration is an important document in American history and sets up a set of ideals that Americans are allegedly supposed to try to approximate, as Lincoln said, ever deepening ever broadening the principles in our society. And so I think there is a certain amount of constant pressure in America toward liberalism because of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights and to the degree to which the Constitution enshrined that. But other than that, whether liberalism is riding high at any given moment is almost entirely dependent on circumstances. And the Depression was a circumstance. World War II was a circumstance. Neither of those events were necessarily inevitable, and they really did lead to the huge burst of liberalism that was the second half of the 20th century."
Qan38UnZ6jZ,8640,James Carville,"Well, yeah. The other thing is, one of the things that we've seen over our careers is the erosion of the convention bounce. I remember when Dukakis actually went ahead of Bush after the convention. Didn't stay ahead obviously, but even Mondale gained a lot of ground on Reagan post-convention. Now you don't get a one or two... the convention doesn't even matter anymore. So in the events that people have traditionally mocked things by the convention bounce, the Labor Day start, that just doesn't apply in today's presidential politics, I don't think. Do you think though the debate would still be important? I mean, that seems like that's an unusual moment if it happens. If the debate is about abortion, it will help a lot. And if the debate... I actually think that... I'm really thinking hard about this, but they should run against MAGA and not Trump. Interesting. Explain that. Because MAGA is less popular than Trump. And what I would think that Biden's [inaudible] says, ""you've been overtaken by this MAGA movement."" Because we need a lot of people who voted for Trump and not all of them are MAGAs. A lot of them have different reasons. We need some of those people. And if we can drive a stake between MAGA and them, we could get some or some could stay home because they're not comfortable with it."
xe4VasGhOGV,5471,Aaron Friedberg,"That's not the foundation for an enduring American grand strategy, to the contrary. That's awfully well said, that last one. You really put together I think one of the fundamental problems with Trump. People, like me, are interested in the somewhat the ideology, the political theory underlying it, and America First, and I'm very appalled by that. So I probably focus on that more than just the pure transactional and erratic and undisciplined character, and the failure to even understand that you should have a strategy. I mean, the American First strategy would also be very bad. So if the choice is going to be a mixture of a very bad international strategy and no international strategy probably mixing together in the Oval Office there with Trump. But let me ask you one last question and then I'll let you go, but you've studied American politics and some of the interaction of US politics and foreign policy, international relations over a long time. You've studied it for a long time, but you've studied it in practice over the last century and during the Cold War, and you've written about that. I was talking to someone actually earlier today about this. I was consistent with what I just said, maybe the better critique of Trump for the American public is a little less the America First thing, or even the tariffs, though I think that probably has some potency, or the explaining the knock-on effects of deserting Ukraine, which I do think people have a sense of, so I think that's all important."
ab2Na3JTD6q,5717,Tim Snyder,"That leads us to these debates, which I think you've just kind of cut through where people say, ""Well, is it really fascism? Because let me give you a list of 11 things, and maybe it only meets..."" That misses the point, because fascism isn't really about being rational, it's about being irrational. It's about will over reason, and the leader, and the single party. But the party's not a party, it's a movement. It's not about institutions, it's about turning institutions into something else. Yeah, I think your point is very helpful, because I think Putin is a fascist, and I think it's taken way too long for people to realize that. And the fact that we haven't realized it has disabled-as I see it, this is maybe more my world than yours-but it's disabled a lot of people on the left. One of the heartbreaking things for me about the last 10 years is that I see all these people who regard themselves as anti-fascist. Okay, if you're an anti- fascist, that means not that you deny that fascism exists, it means that when it's there you oppose it. I see a lot of people who I feel like you missed your chance, or you're missing your chance. If you're an anti-fascist, you should go to Kyiv right now and show solidarity."
sgNAGx41V0_,16635,Anne Applebaum,"And also, as you say, some of the early things that everyone was focused on, the tanks and all, some of them got delivered, some didn't. In any case, they don't seem nearly as important. And it is kind of an amazing story. I guess there are other comparable stories, and obviously there are in world history, but I don't know, this is pretty striking, isn't it? I mean- It's essentially the reinvention of the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian military industry during a war. I mean, I suppose that does happen during wars. The United States invented nuclear weapons during the war for the purposes of the war. And the Germans actually during World War II invented long-range rockets in the same way. So it's not unheard of. But as I said, I don't know that the scale of it is understood. I mean, there is a, I don't want to be Pollyanna-ish, I mean, the Russians also innovate. They copy the Ukrainians. They still have much greater scale. They have a wider and deeper production, and so and so. They still have huge advantages. But the fact remains that we are more than three years into the war, and the front line is barely moving. I mean, by the standards of wars. It moves a little bit, but the collapse of the front line that people were predicting six months ago never happened, and we're now at the end of the summer."
yGX4P8WI6bZ,5353,Tom Tugendhat,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased and really honored to be joined today by Tom Tugendhat, a member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, from the wonderfully named constituency of Tonbridge and Malling. Did I pronounce that correctly? I doubt it. Tonbridge, Tonbridge- Tonbridge, what was I thinking? Tonbridge. It looks like Tonbridge, so I figured it couldn't be pronounced Tonbridge. Anyway, it's Kent, I believe. And Tom has been in the Parliament, been a Conservative member since 2015, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, which you've used as a real, not just a bully pulpit, but really a place to help shape policy, I think. And before that very involved in foreign affairs, foreign policy debates. That's how we met. You served in the British Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, and really gave a wonderful speech people should go back and look at, almost a year ago. I was thinking about this, we're two weeks on from a year on our pullout from Afghanistan, and a very moving speech, really on the floor of the House. Anyway, Tom, thanks so much for joining me today. Bill, it's good to be with you again. I should also have mentioned Tom was a candidate for Tory Party leadership, which would in turn make one prime minister and did better than everyone expected, but was eliminated in one of those rounds."
_JEsJ1K9QiF,3393,David Axelrod,"But now, he's micro channeling, to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just... All that said, Bill, that's just an aside, I'm just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don't think, at the end of the day, that the campaign should be based on all of that. The campaign should be based on fundamental quality of life issues, and people need to know there's a choice, and am I better off with this choice or that choice, and why? And I do think you look at these two guys, and one thing that is absolutely crystal clear is that one guy, leaving aside the issue of age and efficacy, I would argue he's been much more effective than he gets credit for, but one guy is focusing on a set of issues that will impact positively on the quality of life of most Americans, and the other guy is completely consumed by himself and his own interests, and I think that's something people need to focus on. Yeah, that's interesting. He's an effective demagogue and he's a good entertainer, in his own way, and I agree with you, he's in a way a little crazier than he was, but he is also better, in some ways, at being a demagogue than he was, because he's really discovering what works."
Ubccai0CB8Q,14691,Anne Applebaum,"People didn't understand how that would look actually in Germany or in Europe, right? That I mean- Oh, in Germany, Germany, it looks like the United States is our enemy and they want to topple German democracy. And that's what people think. I mean, again, I don't think Chancellor Merz is going to say that, but you can meet plenty of Germans who believe that now. And not without some, I mean, it is extraordinary. It's one thing to be, and this is a point you've made, others have made too. It's one thing, America First had its own God knows problems and deficiencies, but you can imagine a policy of, let's call it ""restraint"" or America First where you don't get involved. Forget about all that liberal internationalism that you and I have been mostly in favor of and supporting other liberal democracies. We just stay out of these things. They go dictatorship, they go dictatorship, but we'll survive. We have two oceans, blah, blah, blah. So it kind of more let's say principled or consistent isolationism really. But that's not where Trump and Vance turned out to be, or at least not Vance, I mean, Trump's a little more confusing and stuff, but certainly Vance and the new right in America is not there. The new right is for authoritarian governments everywhere, they're as internationalist as we are in their own way, right?"
0b0sQgj8O0L,15912,Anne Applebaum,"I think that's both the problem here... And maybe more so in foreign policy because the infrastructure is more fragile, so to speak, don't you think, in the world order than it is here at home. Well, we'll see. I mean, as I said, some of this is so new to people. I mean, frankly, it's not new to me, but it's new to leaders of most European countries and it's new and how people will adjust. We'll see. I mean, it will be very hard, if not impossible, for the United States ever to build up the credibility it enjoyed six months ago in Europe. Which is a terrible thing to say. Anytime soon. And that's a very bad thing. It just in and of itself. I mean, you're a student of autocracy. The two books really were the first on the Twilight of Democracy and the second on Autocracy, Inc. You've been watching what's happening here, the Defense Department purge, the let's get rid of the JAGs, especially because God forbid there should be attorneys telling the military that this might not be a lawful order, FBI with Patel. I mean, has it gone faster than you expected? More radical in tone and in purpose than you expected? I rather thought he might try to boil the frog slowly, but I think they've gone for the opposite shock and awe strategy."
JJCDzbEh8Tu,5341,Tim Snyder,"And if we do finally get this aid package through and the Europeans continue to be, we can come back to this, I think in my judgment, better than they might've been standing up pretty well for Ukraine. You think this for now, it's kind of, I don't know if it's really a frozen conflict technically, but it's kind of not moving very much conflict on the main lines of battle, you think that's sustainable for Ukraine for a while? I mean even if ultimately they could... one hopes they will win, but you're not panicked about the current situation. No, I'm going to... Let me talk about frozen conflict for a second. Because frozen conflict, that's a deliberate political aim. You go into part of Moldova, you freeze the conflict, and I would want to avoid that term because it suggests that nothing's ever going to change. But also because it's an aim in itself, like if we accept it's a frozen conflict, then we say, ""Oh, well then there's kind of nothing we can do. It's frozen."" So, it's an active hot war. It's a war of attrition in which you're right- But isn't it also, it's a Russian aim in some conflicts, whereas here, their aim isn't really a frozen conflict, is it? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, their aim as they make clear every day in the statements of their highest political authorities and their propaganda shows every evening, their aim is to destroy the Ukrainian state."
NE_cs39mdCH,3098,David Axelrod,"The kind of the policy side, the personality side? Yeah. I think the temptation is to focus on just morality, ethics, democracy, and so on. But I keep saying to people, if you're speaking, I feel deeply about it. You feel deeply about it. We are bonded in this notion that democracy depends on rules and laws and norms and institutions. If your president is about the business of destroying them all, that is a fundamentally threatening prospect. That said, I suspect that if you're sitting around the kitchen table talking about the future of democracy, you're not worried about the cost of the food you're eating. You're not worried about your rent and your gas. I do think that the voters, I think ultimately the voters who care deeply about democracy and about Trump's sundering of it are going to vote for Joe Biden. I think that the real challenge for the Biden campaign is to reach people for whom that might not be the primary concern. That for whom, I think, principally economic issues are the concern, but also they have concerns about personal safety, and many have concerns about the viability of their childrens' future. And a lot of young people who are disillusioned, we talk about abortion rights, which is a motivator for young people, we talk about how the war has affected young people and so on."
oyEN56FfyFx,6306,Aaron Friedberg,"Are they really going to just allow Russia to just destroy and devastate millions of Ukrainians? So the nature of the war, I think, makes it harder to get to. Yes, and I think, also, the nature of the technologies involved, the fact that you have these long range standoff weapons on both sides, so even if you had a stabilized front on the ground, you could continue to have strikes on infrastructure and military targets going back and forth in both directions. No, that's really a good point. People don't make that point too often. So let's talk about demilitarized zone. What does that even mean when much of the war's being fought at long distance? Yes. Yeah, yeah. And then China, just to wrap up their little tour de [inaudible] here. That's been, I guess, superficially a little quieter, Asia, maybe than Europe or the Middle East, but not, I take it, in your judgment, more settled or stable than it was nine months ago? No, certainly not. Although it is, of the three theaters that we're talking about now, it is the quietest in that there isn't the ongoing, large-scale shooting war. The tensions, obviously, between the United States and China continue. China continues to apply pressure to Taiwan. They've been doing things to put more pressure on the Philippines."
sbBZkgInmpA,5896,Aaron Friedberg,"People who want to give him the benefit of the doubt, will interpret one nice thing he says about one democratic ally or about Israel, let's say, a country people are concerned about, obviously, and think that's really a sound basis for thinking his foreign policy is going to be fine. But there's so much evidence that he's willing, as you say, if the Chinese decide, well, you know what, he's back in office so maybe we should give him some economic Bennies now and a little bit of bribery. It's not bribery literally, but it could be that too. But I mean bribery in the sense of rewards for stuff, and then he'll let the pressure off, right? I mean, I think you've thought about this so much, I mean, the risks of pursuing a foreign policy in the world we're in, and if you're the US, the anchor of resisting all these bad forces, a policy that's not grounded on some degree of medium and long-term thinking and strategic thinking as opposed to this thing, I like this guy here and that guy there, and I'm going to threaten him here, but then I'm going to reward him there, I just think, I don't know, people don't seem to me to appreciate the risks of that. Right. Well, historically, to the extent that we have pursued a consistent grand strategy, if you like, over long periods of time, those have been rooted in geopolitical calculations, but also in values or ideology."
1ufT1dR2006,7383,Robert Kagan,"And you can read, then you can feel it in reading someone like Deneen who talks about liberal totalitarianism, et cetera. But there is a great feeling that these people feel oppressed by liberalism. And they're right, they are being oppressed by liberalism. But it's the founders' liberalism, not some creation of crazy progressivism of the late- twentieth century. And I suppose one corollary of this sort of, let's not be progressive, I can use that term in our understanding of history, let's not have a kind of wiggish understanding of history, I guess is what it used to be called, this kind of nice inevitable movement forward in a liberal direction with occasional hiccups, is that these other periods have real world effects. That's a point people don't quite...When I think of the twenties, well, there was this kind of immigration act that was unfortunate because it reflected a kind of real racism and obviously and prejudice and stupid eugenic theories as you're saying. But it also really changed our immigration policy for decades. It wasn't really changed until the sixties, and it reduced the number of immigrants in the U.S. radically in terms of the percentage coming in. And incidentally you mentioned the anti-Semitism thing, made me think of it. We didn't let Jews... I mean think of that, everyone knew what was happening in Germany by '37, '38 certainly after Kristallnacht, right?"
soVLq5BhafI,14485,Anne Applebaum,"That's part of the deal. All were so alarmed by what they saw in Alaska and by what they feared might have been happening in Alaska behind closed doors that they all got on their various planes and came to Washington to make sure that President Zelensky wasn't bullied by Trump and Vance again like he was back in February. I mean, it was a piece of diplomatic coordination on a really unusual scale. And as I said, it shows not just their understanding of the stakes of the war, but also their understanding of the profound change in Washington. And none of them will say this publicly, and I understand why, and I don't wish them to do anything else. I mean, they're all still talking about how wonderful President Trump is, and they are full of compliments when they see him, and so on, and I understand why that's happening. But believe me, people are horrified, and they're horrified both by the Trump-Alaska meeting but also by the domestic politics inside the United States, which look like nothing anybody in Europe has ever seen before. They're horrified by the language that comes out of the administration, whether it's from Vance or from the people talking about tariffs. I mean, the tariffs are a background to this story too."
bqqulb8BOs5,5421,Tim Snyder,"So, it's not that the far-left... I'm talking about the extreme left now, like the communist left. But it's not that people like the Soviet Union despite the violence. They liked it because of the violence. And this is something which is very hard... we don't want to think this. We want to think everybody's basically a nice liberal or whatever, a nice conservative. We want to think people are basically decent souls and sometimes they're misled, but actually there is a taste of blood that people like, at least at a distance and sometimes in proximity. And so the reason that I'm referring to why people didn't find the Soviet Union as sexy in the '60s as they did in the '30s, is that it's consistent with what you're saying. Abstracting away from the politics, it makes sense, actually, that people liked Nazi Germany after they realized what it really was. And this is what's happened with Putin's Russia as well. If you look at the people who are now going to Russia or who are now vlogging for Russia on the internet. These are people who like the fact that Russia's killing lots of Ukrainians. They like the fact that Russia's trying to prosecute a genocide. They like the fact that Russia's pushing for a world where might makes right."
wczts-9AR4V,4601,Tim Snyder,"Well, maybe right now the weak link, and potentially the very, very weak link. What I was struck by I was in Europe a few times, a year ago meeting with pretty senior Germans and I think the [inaudible] is more real than not, a little more glass half full than half empty and especially the younger Greens in Germany have been excellent. It's funny, I said to one of them at the end of a meeting, ""I never thought when I was a Reagan Republican that the party I would like the most and admire the most really in Germany would be the 40 year old Green leaders and not the CDU or for that matter SPD leaders. But when talking to senior Germans from the foreign policy defense world, what was striking to me was-one forgets this again in one's solipsistic American way-we have just all these capabilities. We are a global power. We have intelligence. We have a ton of weapons. We could make a lot more and probably should be making more. We have many, many things we can do. No European country is even remotely set up that way. Their individual companies run, they do very good things, individual militaries that are extremely impressive, I would say, of the Balts and the Nordic states, and so forth."
2MrD6qYNNBI,8919,James Carville,"She's a prosecutor, but they've cleverly, I think, linked together being tough on crime, not linked together but said she's prosecuted in a way that criminals and she's also got after big corporations that have been ripping people off. It's like she gets the populist economic stuff in a little bit and she gets the tough on crime in. Good for her. You go, girl. That seems like an intelligent ad. Let's talk about playing defense a little. It seems to me the two biggest problems she has with the 2019 position she took and that Democratic primary, why was that primary so crazy? I can't even remember how... I forgot until I saw one of these Republican ads, how frankly, nuts at all seemed. And then I think the 2020 with the pick of Governor Walz, the 2020 riots in Minnesota, which were pretty bad honestly. I don't even understand it about this fund that she urged people to give money to bail people out. Anyway, make that, they're going to put the crime issue front and center, the Republicans, I believe like, today. How would you advise her to deal with that? Either 2019 and/or 2020. There's a minor fact, and I would bring it up. The crime rate since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's second office has plummeted."
mZuGbOe3pBV,9629,Mark Esper,"Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability. I think that's under... I think that's right. That seems like it's underappreciated, actually. Yeah. We did a number of things, and I know you eventually want to talk about the Trump administration. I think one of the things that the Trump administration did well was approved providing javelins, for example, javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine. That came in very effective when the Russians invaded a few years later. But beyond that, we did a lot of training trying to bring Ukraine up to NATO standards. We had US forces, NATO forces there. I actually went to the city of Lviv in Western Ukraine where we were training them, spent a couple of days on the ground talking to Ukrainians, talking to our people. So it was a great effort. And I believe as much as the weapons, training the Ukrainians to NATO standards, NATO tactics and techniques, when they would eventually go against a Russian army still using Soviet Bloc tactics really made a big difference in the initial days of the war."
4KpzF-Cr3X1,9134,James Carville,"And he's instinctive enough to realize this. He's got a lot to risk either way. I would much rather be her than him. And of course, she also has another kind of built in advantage. She'd kind of be judged against Biden's June the 27th performance, which is... It's pretty low bar. But I think the whole debate question is elevated and I think she has a pretty good position in it. Yeah, no, I hadn't really focused on that. I think it's really a good point. Of course, I'm aware that June 27th is the most consequential presidential debate in history at this point since it caused an actual change in candidates. But you're right. So there's, as you say, greater debate awareness in general, which gives her a chance to use the issue in a more maybe important way than... Typically, there's such tit-for-tat. It's totally trivial, I think, the effect of... ""You said you would debate there. Here, we should have three debates, not two."" Whatever it takes to chicken George out. Right. But this is more... You can't use a historical benchmark to talk about this because debates have now taken on near legendary status in American politics. Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out."
ELwgWiQac5U,15063,Anne Applebaum,"If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful. Well, there's another... I mean, it's almost a bigger issue than that. I mean, it's not just about Ukraine. Do Americans want to be allied with Russia against Europe? Is that how we see ourselves in the world? I don't know that all Americans have supported our foreign policy. In fact, I'm sure they haven't all supported our foreign policy over the last several decades. But to switch from one day to the next from being a country that at least defined itself in theory as the leader of the democratic world to a country that defines itself as an ally of Russia against the democratic world, people want that? I don't think so because that then begins to touch on Americans' self-definition. I mean, who are we? What kind of a country are we? Are we a kleptocracy in an oligarchy like the Russians? Is that what we are now? I am not 100% sure that everybody wants to see their country that way. It's one thing to have an America that wants to be a good and nice country and sometimes fails, which we could say was the case in recent years."
jfOS4MFRw8w,7801,A.B. Stoddard,"This is not what he wanted. It is kind of amazing. I mean, things so often go the opposite from one expects. I mean in 2020, the Democrats won the trifecta when they won the Georgia Senates. And everyone thought, okay, this is it. But rebound from Trump, Biden gets to govern, he has support and they have to sort of mandate. And of course, 2021 was a bad year legislatively for Democrats. Was a huge fight over Build Back Better and stuff, Afghanistan pullout, that was more the administration obviously. But a lot of criticism, even for Democrats in Congress. Then everyone went in, as you were saying earlier, 2022, that's going to, Democrats badly split. Republicans have all these chances, some decent candidates maybe will emerge. And of course the opposite happens. Some horrible Republican candidates emerge. Democrats and Biden sort of managed to pull it together for various reasons, and in various ways. Including Ukraine, which he responded well to, and where he had bipartisan support. Which sort of reminded people that he's the president, and we should be grateful that he's the president. I don't know, all kinds of things happened, right? A world of Afghanistan being the headlines is very different for a world of Ukraine being the headlines. So 2022 surprised on the upside for the Democrats, I think it's fair to say."
M2oEYljD1zI,6783,Jack Goldsmith,"And that would be terrible for the country in my view and for the idea of apolitical justice. So that's the thing I'm most discouraged and worried about, in terms of what DOJ might do. Is this a DOJ thing or an FBI thing primarily? I understand FBI is part of DOJ. Well, they're going after both. They've pledged to go after both. And again, Kash Patel has said very different things, SS Pam Bondi, these are the nominees for Attorney General and FBI. I don't know what they're going to do. At times, they've pledged to prosecute the president's enemies, to root out the people who were against him, whom they think have done something, I suppose, is criminal. There are other times when they say they want to end lawfare, and the president, just last weekend, said that the best retribution is success. He seemed to be, in some sense, of course, speaking out of both sides of his mouth saying he wasn't going to push the Justice Department to prosecute, but they still deserve to be prosecuted. I don't know what they're going to do, but it is definitely the Justice Department, there's the Justice Department component and there's an FBI component, and it's got two elements. One is cleaning house, so to speak, getting rid of people that they think are disloyal, under the guise of reform."
khcAYnPJO99,6447,Tom Tugendhat,"Very much so, so I mean, what does a world in which we've pulled out of Afghanistan and watched the Taliban take that back over, and then six months later, Ukraine goes under, or part of it, a large part of it, let's say, to a brutal invasion from Putin. I mean, that's a very different world from the one we're looking at now, where unfortunately, Afghanistan still is in terrible shape, but maybe Afghanistan was the end of a period of weakness and retrenchment, not the harbinger of our future, right? I mean really, when you think about it, I kind of come back to the degree to which 2022 could really be a pivot point, not just for Ukraine, though most importantly obviously for them, and they deserve most of the credit and most of the... All honor to them, but really, for all of us. Don't you think? I mean, think of what it looks like if Afghanistan is followed by a bad... Both failure there, but you're absolutely right to... But what if we just don't step up, and we're sort of still desperately trying to negotiate with Putin three weeks after he's started the war and so forth, yeah. Look, I mean, Bill, the point I was making in that speech I gave in August last year was that it's not just Afghanistan, right?"
_cIZ74P1wlN,7195,Jack Goldsmith,"And more importantly, when the Justice Department says something would violate criminal law if done, that is very fraught even if the president says it's okay for anyone to go forward. And there were a lot of people including Bob Mueller, who's the FBI director who said, ""I'm just not willing to do this even if the president says so."" And he was going to resign. So it's a hugely important office for having... I mean that's a big power, which has to be exercised carefully. But to your point, just backing up a little bit, it's important to have someone who is independent to some extent. Who's on the team in terms of sharing the outlook and goals of the administration and maybe even the general interpretive view of Article II, but not in the can for the White House saying yes to everything because that's just not the way it worked. The law just doesn't allow the president to do whatever he wants. Yeah, you mentioned the FBI director, and that's very much now, again, regardless of the wisdom of the 10-year term and how sacrosanct that should be treated and all that, there's some virtue to having an FBI director who will say, ""Look, in this case I think the Assistant Attorney General has the right argument, not the White House people."" Listen, Bob Mueller was absolutely the key person there when he told the president that he wasn't going to be able to continue the program because OLC and the Justice Department had made this ruling."
VlK8Ony8-hL,14498,Anne Applebaum,"And that known path leads also to other known places. It leads to falsified or rigged elections. It leads to imbalances in the system whereby... I don't know. Here, I'm inventing possibilities, but whereby the federal government could put pressure on donors to the Democratic Party, could make it hard for Democrats to run election, could seek to create an unfair playing field. Could, well, we've seen this already, begin to put pressure on media to report things or write in a different way. Once the federal government has those kinds of powers or the authoritarian government, then it becomes much harder for the other side to compete. So, the earlier we attempt to stop it and the earlier people recognize and name what this is and develop a strategy to fight again, the easier it's going to be because the farther you go down the road, the harder it becomes to turn back. And also, people are starting to notice this recently I've seen, it also leads to much greater possibility of civic unrest. I mean, it's not simply that they take over everything. It's that there's resistance, but then countries start to split up. I mean you can't even imagine it in the US these days, the Civil War was a long time ago, but it does look a lot like the 1850s period."
PrrNFJt5053,3930,David Axelrod,"I think that it's probably wise to make that decision closer to the event because who knows what condition Trump is going to be in going into that convention? If you need it, you should do it. If he does it, how he does it and how he appears to people will be obviously very important. If he needs a debate, he needs a good debate. He needs a debate in which his performance seems vigorous and engaged. It's almost as important as what he says. That's what Rove's point was in our discussion, but I'd make that decision later. His answer when he was asked this was, ""Well, it depends on how he behaves,"" which doesn't exactly sound like a prescription for debating because if you're going on the basis of Trump's behavior, he disqualifies himself every day. It does hold open the decision and my guess is they will hold that decision open until they have to make it. RFK Junior and other possible third, fourth, fifth parties? I mean serious problem, clear who he takes votes from or not? Can the campaigns arrange things, push things so that he takes votes more from the other candidate than from your own candidate? Yeah, I think first of all, general premise, Trump has always gotten around 46%, 47% of the vote."
3HyETHl1zmo,8373,Robert Kagan,"By Civil War, by... Eisenhower had to send the troops to Little Rock. The south was in full rebellion after Brown v. Board of Education, 1954. Something like 1/5 of Congress signed the Southern Manifesto, almost all of them Democrats at the time. These forces do not go away, they just are suppressed. And I think what Donald Trump has done has revealed to us, he's shined a light on the fact that millions of Americans still prefer a country in which whites have certain numbers of privileges, and they feel that the country's being taken away from them by non-whites and non-Christians. And the thing is is that they think... people act like this is a special moment, the left has gone too far, progressives have gone too far. But what I found striking striking in writing and researching this history is that the very same comments about how other groups are being preferred over whites and the whites and white Christians in particular are losing ground, you find those same quotations at every stage. If you go back and read the comments of the Imperial Grand Wizard in the 1920s, he sounds like a MAGA politician now, and he sounds like Donald Trump really talking about how the whites are being mistreated in America today. And that is Donald Trump's number one selling point."
zuB3WTXbMCy,8953,A.B. Stoddard,"All they'd have to do is say you have to pledge to support the nominee and they won't hold Trump to [inaudible] but of course they would hold Liz to it. But they're not going to hold Trump to it. Right, of course not. He's not going to pledge to support any nominee except for him. Will he debate, do you think? What do you think? I don't think he will. Interesting. Because it's just a set-up for failure. He could go in and start screaming at everybody and saying crazy things and dominate, and he likes that, I think he enjoys the actual fight, but I think he knows, he's telling people privately, I'm too far ahead, he knows that the most likely outcome is he loses his lead a little bit and so what's the point? And they can all stand the stage and say he's afraid and he'll be like, ""They're afraid."" Yeah, it draws him down to their level if you're the front-runner in your debate, whereas he's done a town hall, he's not scared of anything. This is where that CNN Town Hall let's just do a final before we get to President Biden, who's important. This is, of course, typical of the Biden years, you spend the first half hour of the conversation on Trump, Right."
Fi6KqEQBCmw,7763,A.B. Stoddard,"I guess maybe the speaker vote thing, which was sort of an short-term embarrassment to McCarthy was kind of also a wake-up call for all the others that we can't go through, it would hurt them all if everything just broke. They needed to ultimately come together and play the hand they had. And as I say on the flip side, I am struck at the Democrats lack of political skill, it feels to me. I mean they should be... I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, and maybe they're holding back their fire, it's too early and so forth. They did all vote for this budget that has all kind of budget cuts, the debt ceiling-slash-budget- legislation that does have a lot of budget cuts in it, presumably. We'll see if they can make Republicans pay for that. Right. Well I mean, they tried. They tried to say it was cuts to veterans and stuff, but I think they're used to only fighting against Trump. And I will add, Bill, it's not beyond the possibility, because Trump said so at the town hall and he has since said on Truth Social, if the Republicans don't demand this and they don't demand that, and of course he recommend that they do a default. So look, as this gets more difficult in the next few weeks, it's not..."
YTr6x5OIrfu,7445,A.B. Stoddard,"And abortion and mass shootings are top of mind for young voters and will very much drive the turnout of young voters in the next cycle. And so they could concentrate on the things that they agree on while saying crime is a serious issue and we need to control the border or whatever they would need to do. But to know that you were locking down critical electoral college states with next generation leaders against Trump would be obviously the smartest move, I think. And like you said to me a month ago, we were just chatting, that the thing that undercut the Stoddard-Kristol plan the most was probably the 2022 results where Democrats outperformed, right? Yeah. And so last year when you and I talked, I was expecting a huge ... There was so much tension last summer between the progressives and the moderates in the Democratic Party and this divide that was the hangover from the Build Back Better fight. And the progressives didn't get what they wanted. And after we spoke, of course, we spoke about a month after the Dobbs decision, right? Is that...? Yeah. Just around the time of the decision. About, yeah. I think it was about a month after, yeah. And then I guess they had just passed the gun legislation, but then there was this slew of the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act."
w-AGDmRmgWG,6136,Jack Goldsmith,"And also, we'll have some sense of some of the real-world effects of some of these things, right? Absolutely. And let me just say the proof's in the pudding. I mean, however they organize the government, whether they can make the country better is the ultimate test. And people have different views of what making the country better is, but the success of the presidency is going to turn on that big picture question. And who knows? Who knows? Jack Goldsmith, thank you. Really, this is a terrific conversation. I think very educational for me personally, and I think for our viewers and listeners. So, Jack, thank you for joining me. Thank you, Bill. It's really a pleasure and I hope we can do it again. Yeah, let's do it again. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
AhW0NJlrOgg,5988,Tim Snyder,"The interesting thing is it doesn't ever really go wrong. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, and I will tell you what you think about voter suppression. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, I will tell you what you think about a whole range of other issues. You can tell. You know this better than me, but with Republicans, it's really striking. For me, the people who have... Because I have spent a lot of time the last couple of years talking to Republican elected officials and others about Ukraine. The people who have a moral vocabulary about Ukraine also have a moral vocabulary about the US. It may not be my moral vocabulary, but they have one. There's some set of moral commitments out there. Whereas the people who diminish Ukraine, or who try to push it aside, or who repeat Russian talking points, they also don't have the moral vocabulary about the US. About the US, it's also always about criticizing, dismissing, making fun, mocking. There's nothing positive there. Yeah, no, it's so true. The tradition of liberalism, of a liberalist that was anti-fascist and anti- communist... I was talking to actually a Democratic member of Congress who I phrased, I think on TV or something, just sounding like Scoop Jackson. I said, ""My first vote was for Scoop Jackson in a primary in 1972."" I was a Scoop Jackson Democrat before I was a Reagan Republican."
skVPkj-4cVk,3806,David Axelrod,"The one thing I think you can predict is it's going to be close one way or the other. Beyond that, I would not venture. We'll get back together maybe after the conventions or maybe- I'm not sure a lot of what I said makes sense. No, no, it makes sense. You're not recording this, are you? I don't want to be held accountable. No, what's good these days with the internet and all that- I always love talking with you. Nothing lasts forever. No one could ever go back and look at all the things you said a few months ago. It just disappears into the ether. Listen, this is a bit of Trump's nightmare, right? Video tape, because in Trump's world every day is a new day, what you said in the past doesn't matter. He does as witnessed by this ad that Biden's running with the tape of Trump bragging about ending Roe versus Wade. I mean tough to erase that stuff. Anyway, great to be with you as always. David, thank you. Really thanks a lot for this very insightful and thought provoking conversation. It was fun, always fun. Thank you, David Axelrod, and thank you for joining us on Conversations ."
hUBno2u-4rD,6238,Jack Goldsmith,"And again, no expectation of equal treatment for people or bidding. When I was at the Education Department, I mean, bidding processes for grants, and it was yeah, and then you'd be appealed of something. One person on the review committee had some relationship with one of the places that got the $5 million education grant. It was like, we probably go too far the other way, honestly. But how- So- ...struck are you by that? Or I don't know. So, here's how I think about this. I'll start at the 40,000-foot level, and you know this better than I. There's been an incessant fight really going back to Jackson and maybe Jefferson, Andrew Jackson or Thomas Jefferson, about how much control the president should have over top appointees and how deeply into the Executive Branch that should go. And doesn't the president have a right to put in place his people so that he can effectuate the consequences of the election? That's the argument for democracy on the one hand, and then the argument from expertise and neutrality on the other and it's always been a back and forth. And this has gone on really from the beginning of the nation in some sense with peaks and valleys. And in some sense, I'm sympathetic to the idea that a president should be able to come in and especially, and frankly, Republican presidents, and I think you'd agree with this, have always received more resistance from ...I'm making a general claim."
I0CVpvESNdA,8171,A.B. Stoddard,"Is that...? Yeah. Just around the time of the decision. About, yeah. I think it was about a month after, yeah. And then I guess they had just passed the gun legislation, but then there was this slew of the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act. So, all of a sudden, they went to the midterms with this serious rage against the Dobbs decision helping them and then also a slew of legislative accomplishments. And everybody united around the abortion decision and the party, they didn't fight with each other, but they still expected to lose a lot of seats, in which case they were anticipating a huge come-to-Jesus moment in the party. I thought that was going to affect the leadership elections, and it would have. If there was a slaughter, it would have been a huge fight about how to mobilize young people and all the stuff that the far left always talks about and how to swing swing districts. And that didn't happen. They were not able to divine a message except that abortion helps us, and so they never had the talk. And so it's so interesting- And that Biden was a good leader because they did pretty well. And it looked great for Biden. It looked great for Biden. He defied history. And so they carried on in a united front."
KYqDGIwHjKl,7431,Tom Tugendhat,"It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia. And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people."
4Bi5R0hV2JS,15371,Anne Applebaum,"And nor is there any precedent for Musk personally deciding which programs he likes and dislikes and which ones he wants to freeze. This is not being done by any kind of process. Not only is Congress not involved, it doesn't even look to me like other members of the administration are involved. Trump seems only vaguely aware of what Musk is doing. Some of the stuff they've done, like the destruction they've wrought on USAID, which I can talk about if you want, because I've spent a lot of time talking to people from there in the last few days. But that wasn't telegraphed during the campaign. Nobody was angry that the US was helping Sudanese refugees. There was no narrative against them. Nor were Americans really worked up about USAID's support for independent media, which is tiny amounts of money, in places where there's no free media. But Musk has decided that all these things count as waste and fraud, even though these are congressionally mandated programs, and he's been saying that that's what he's doing. The fact that he's printed these lists of fraud that he supposedly found that are untrue, that he keeps mentioning things that he's cut, which turn out to be fake... No, there were not $50,000 of condoms going to Gaza. No, there was not money being paid to Chelsea Clinton."
b0HKjoI4Xhj,3532,David Axelrod,"And since, as you said at the beginning, it's two incumbents, most recent president and the current president, it's a tough uphill slog, it seems to me, if they're looking at these two presidencies, they're not looking, unlike with Romney and the current presidency- Right. ...and someone who, if he were successful, would define himself as bringing about a brighter future, but you succeeded in defining him as threatening a brighter future. Here, you've got two records, and if they think they did better under Trump, how do you dislodge that? Or do you just forget about the past and almost make it all about- Well, first of all, let me say it is really interesting. We tend not to credit people with good sense, but most people have good sense, and so they're kind of giving Trump a pass on the final year of his administration- Right. ...because they say, ""Well, that was the pandemic, he couldn't help it."" To some degree, perhaps, they will give Biden some... If Biden adjusts his economic talking points, I think they may give him some credit for managing through a difficult thing and understanding the burdens of that. But yeah, this is a concern that Trump's ratings, just as president, there's this gauzy reminiscence of Trump. Now, I think some of that may be allayed, and this may conflict with what I just said, but I don't think the two are contradictory."
5v2nIv4svk2,7645,Jack Goldsmith,"They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump. And let me just say, part of what Trump is about is to just blow up all these norms. He thinks or talks or acts as if he thinks that they're just illegitimate, that they're corrupt, that the Justice Department is under the control of the deep state or the Democrats or some combination of both. And there were some deep state shenanigans against him in his first term, and I get it, but this is all completely out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, it's started to become ordinary. There's so many things, nobody, just to change topics for a second, nobody in this election talked about tax disclosure, very few people. That was a big deal in 2016, 2020. Trump defied it twice, and now, nobody cares. And it had been in practice for, what, 40 years or something like that? Going back to Watergate, going back either to Ford or Carter, I can't remember. And same with conflict of interest rules, very little discussion of that. Now, it's just accepted, now, that they're not going to follow the statutory rules, almost very few of them, and none of the important ones apply to the president."
rUx3X4DaxWi,7710,A.B. Stoddard,"This is an incredible accomplishment. Because he was able to get them around the table to agree on a bill that would increase the debt ceiling. Most had said they wouldn't vote for a bill to even increase the debt ceiling. So they voted for this bill with all their cuts. They united as a conference and they remain united as conference. He convinced all of them that if you start going on Fox and crapping on me, it's going to hinder my hand with Biden. I have better leverage with Biden if you stay on sides. And he has kept them under the tent. I don't know how long it lasts, I don't know what the final compromise is that has to go through the Senate Democrats and then attract 10 Republican senators, or whatever's going to happen. This could get very, very difficult, very quickly. But McCarthy has succeeded because of how intensely he communicates with people. And God knows, Bill, what he has promised them. We didn't know that in January, and we don't know what he's continued to promise them. But for their silence, he has definitely talked a good game, because it's succeeded in silencing the Freedom Caucus. And so, again, I don't know how long that lasts. But this, to this date, is very impressive."
uymLQRBYOCY,6927,Robert Kagan,"A lot of people in the North did feel that way, but they were also anti-liberal. I mean, they were officially anti-liberal. They said the Declaration of Independence was a mistake. It didn't need to be there. John Calhoun, he says we shouldn't have had a Declaration of Independence. And there's no question that in the 1920s and '30s, anti-liberalism was the driving force of isolationism. I mean, yes, we don't want to get into another war, but when you're in this period, especially in the 1930s, it's impossible to separate the two. And so if you fast-forward to our present situation, it's clear to me that just as at the time, the America Firsters referred to World War II as the New Dealers' war and did throughout the war, by the way, so Hawley and company see Ukraine as the liberals' war. It's not a war for American interests. It's a war for spreading liberalism. There's this whole theory out there that America is an evil liberal empire. That is, people like Yoram Hazony have made that argument. That's certainly what Steve Bannon says. It's what Patrick Deneen would say. And they're really opposed to America's support for liberalism overseas. And that is a big motivating factor. And I even think that the reason that they are so hawkish on China and so dovish on Europe is that China's a communist country or run by the Communist Party, and they want to insist that America is also being run by communists."
nvcCAy-6wUq,6895,Invisible Rulers,"I've got to stipulate for human beings. RENÉE DIRESTA: Yes. But in the old days, if you were a conspiracy theorist about X, you wouldn't necessarily have entree, so to speak, or be forced into knowledge, even, of a conspiracy theory Y, right? So the scientific kooks would be in a different, the vaccine people would be in a world perhaps from the, I don't know, QAnon types and from other kinds of conspiracies. So that has to be one case in which the new mode of just the fact of the algorithm, I guess you'd say, the new mode of transmission of these things, both rewards conspiracies, because they stay online longer, as you were saying, and they are more passionate and intense and they do what the algorithm wants to optimize for. But also then, more of them would get sucked in than would have been the case once before, maybe. So it does seem like it's a case where it's... RENÉE DIRESTA: Yeah. Yeah. RENÉE DIRESTA: And again, what this was good for was actually bringing people together. We talk a lot about loneliness epidemics and things like this. So the positive vision for what this was supposed to do was to help people find groups. I had a baby in 2013, and it started showing me mom groups."
mUCyr28syyJ,3967,Eric Edelman,"Neither of those things happened. It's not clear that the president on his own can actually lift all of these sanctions. Some of them are imposed by legislation. Others, like taking Syria off the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, the so-called FTO, requires him to submit a report to Congress, which they then have to approve. So to say the least, there were a lot of T's that were left uncrossed and I's that were left undotted in all of this. Now, in the meeting with al-Sharaa, the president did ask, according to the readout from the White House, for some of the things we would want from a new Syria. One of which was, for instance, normalization with Israel, have Syria join the Abraham Accords and become another neighbor of Israel that has made peace with it, it would be like Egypt and Jordan and the UAE, Bahrain, other states surrounding Israel in the region. That would be a good thing. He asked for al-Sharaa to expel some of the foreign jihadis who helped al-Sharaa come to power, but who have since been engaged in intercommunal violence in Syria that has troubled observers who would like to see a stable Syria. He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations, to reintegrate them into the Syrian Armed Forces, and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who, if left untended, could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria."
ffJi3pLO02u,8150,Mark Esper,"We discussed issues all the time. And so having him by my side in that role during the tough days, particularly of 2020, was invaluable. And we kind of weathered a lot together during that time. Yeah, that's so interesting. And I guess also your relationship with Mike Pompeo, with Gina Haspel and the intelligence community, say a word about how much you all... People think of you as each meeting with the president or the president presiding over something in the Sit Room, which you see famous photos of, whether it was in the Biden or the Trump Administration or every administration, but you all had a huge amount of contact with each other and coordination with each other. Well, when it comes to foreign policy, national security, the power players are State and Defense. If you had to think about another agency just writ large, it would be DOJ and Treasury. So those are the big four in that tiering. CIA was there not in a policy role, but DOD particularly worked very closely with the CIA. I had a good relationship with Gina Haspel. So many of our service members, our special operations command in particular, worked with her people, a lot of intelligence sharing. So it was a very, very close relationship there. As you said, with Mike Pompeo, he and I went to West Point together."
o0Drd5C_2zP,6885,Tom Tugendhat,"But are you a little heartened? Are you worried, concerned? What heartens you? What concerns you, et cetera? Well, I mean on one level I'm heartened, there's been huge numbers of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves have expanded from, well, depending on how you count, some two, 300,000 people at arms to what's now, I mean, depending on who you ask, anywhere between 700,000 and a few million in various different ways. I mean, these numbers, for very obvious reasons of national security, the Ukrainians aren't advertising the figures, and of course it depends whether you count things like border forces and reserve battalions and how you count them and so on. But basically the Ukrainians have mobilized their entire nation very effectively. The weapon supplies are coming through from many allies, not all. There's a few notable exceptions that are pretty famous. And the Ukrainians are in a better position than they were when we spoke, whenever it was, eight, 10 weeks ago. The reality is they've just launched their counter offensive in Kherson, an area in the Southeast of the country. I tell you my thoughts and prayers are with their soldiers. I hope very much that they achieve the ends that they need. But the reality is this is a hard slog, and..."
lvBSHeG2sZZ,8944,James Carville,"But yes, everything is better. The polls better, fundraising is better, the enthusiasm is better. It's just unreasonable to even think it's not better. Now, how much it is, I see some of these giddy people on TV and like hey, knock it off. You laugh after the election, not before the election. You were a longtime believer that President Biden shouldn't run for reelection for another four years, even though he's been a good president, that people did not want an 82-year-old and all that, and they wanted a choice of someone younger. I think you certainly vindicated in that judgment, in my opinion, by just the wave of relief almost and enthusiasm that followed Biden stepping down. How much of it is the positive judgment on Vice President Harris at this point? She has had two weeks to campaign and reintroduce herself. Not as much as some people think. It's like I tell people, if you have an infected wisdom tooth and you go to dentist and they pull it out, you feel on top of the world. God, you really don't feel any better than you would if you never had the infected wisdom tooth, but you do feel better now it's gone, just as an example. But I think that people wanted to like her. They were so glad to have a relief and they came in with disposition."
wi-8r2rvroe,3124,Eric Edelman,"I don't even know if there are nominal... I guess there are nominal controls on it, but was that not... Am I overstating that? No, I think that's something that everyone's going to be keeping an eye on as time goes on. I mean, as part of managing strategic competition with China, the Biden administration had developed a series of export controls, a policy that it described as, ""a small yard with a high fence."" In other words, not try and cut off all chips for China, microchips that would be used, for instance, in large language model AI programming and computers, but the very highest end that would presumably give an advantage. So small yard, but very high fence. Those export controls are managed by the Department of Commerce, which is now headed by the Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. There has been a lot of pressure from people like David Sacks, who's the AI czar supposedly of the Trump administration, to relax a lot of this because to compete with China in AI requires a lot of scale. Because China, of course, much larger data, can suck up a lot more data from its billion people than we can. So there is an argument for that at one level. But as you say, Congress, the Select Committee on Competition with China and the Congress formerly co-chaired by Raja Krishnamoorthi and Mike Gallagher, those folks have always been concerned about this and we'll have to see."
5GfFz4dbHRl,5932,Larry Summers,"So two questions about what you said so far related. Let's assume Trump has internalized the notion that the original round of tariffs were wildly too high and disproportionate, and he settles to a policy that I assume most economists would still think is suboptimal, but is some tariffs. And so the world could equilibrate to that presumably, but how much of... Would that reassure people or how much is there still is the uncertainty a problem now almost as much of a problem as the actual dead weight of the tariffs on the economy? I guess A and B, and relatedly, how much is it tariffs and how much is it just the overall governance and God knows whether we're going to have immigrants here, what would have been an important part of the economy and tourism because people don't want to come because they're going to be harassed when they enter and scientific growth because of the biomedical stuff. How much of it is the overall set of policies? And to be fair, some underlying conditions as you said, like the debt and how much of it is tariff specific? Let me say three things. The secret sauce of economics is arithmetic, so I think it's useful to just think about some numbers. The average tariff rate in the United States before Trump's first term was 1.5%."
ZRQqGLnSs6y,3138,Doug Sosnik,"So I think that's going to be a key group of swing voters in 2024. I guess I might add a third one, which are, I don't know if this has been branded, but I would call Bill Kristol Republicans. There are about 20, 25% of Republicans who really dislike Trump, and don't want to vote for Trump. But if you go back to Biden's weaknesses right now, they're some of the people that are really balking at voting for Biden because of how little confidence they have in him, the fear that he is not going to get through a second term and that Kamala Harris is going to be president. And this is amongst the group that need reassurance that Biden is up to four more years. Yeah I'd say those are ""Bill Kristol-adjacent Republicans."" Those of us who are real ex-Republicans, I'm voting against Trump, period. But I agree, I still know, of course, many such people and we all do and would agree that they exist and there's a pretty decent size-enough to make a difference-size of these kind of... Certainly of Biden voters in 2020 who probably voted Republican down ticket or voted Republican some in 2022 and very open to convincing themselves that even though they would've preferred it wouldn't be Trump, maybe Trump isn't quite as dangerous as people like me think and Biden's totally out of his..."
CQegKaVyNMI,9434,Mark Esper,"And then, as you mentioned earlier, I did my time on the Hill and then served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense during the George W. Bush administration. So when you trace back the individual steps, I'd actually served in the Pentagon five times total. I knew my way around the building from various different perspectives as an army officer, as a mid-level civilian appointee, and eventually as Secretary of the Army and Secretary of Defense, so I knew the pace and how it worked and how to pull the levers. But look, a standard day is not unlike a CEO's day, if you will. I'd get in there early after going to the gym, early being at 7:30, and the first thing you typically do is read intelligence, catch up on what happened the night before, and then a series of meetings. And depending on the day of the week, it would be anything from, again, reviewing war plans to reviewing or looking at what some members of Congress are concerned about. It might be White House meetings on a pending policy choice, dealing with NATO or Iran or something like that. But the day usually runs pretty long. I used to try and wrap up by 6:00 PM because I knew that I could stay longer, but there were hundreds of people waiting for me to leave that had to do the cleanup work, the administrative stuff after I left."
jY2tpuxnQbD,6731,Jack Goldsmith,"So there's nothing in the pardon power that prevents these self-serving pardons, but it's really corrosive of the pardon power and not necessarily of the rule of law since this is the part of the law, but it's certainly corrosive to the idea of even-handed justice, that the president can use a pardon to give a get out of jail free card to his friends and family. But reforming that takes a constitutional amendment in my view. There are some things one can do in my view, and Bob and I wrote about this, to put some constraints on the pardon power to clarify that a president can be subject to criminal sanctions for taking a bribe in exchange for a pardon and the like, but these are marginal things and the efficacy of that after the Trump versus US immunity case is unclear. So there's not a whole lot that can be done, and I'll just say one more thing, and then there's the possibility of a self-pardon, which has never been tried, but could happen. Yeah. We're speaking, as you say, just a month after the Biden pardon of his son and what, six weeks before very likely... Not just likely. He said he is going to do it, pardon of January 6th, people who invaded or stormed the Capitol or intruded on the capitol, however you want to say it."
r1hZqHRaqHe,4072,David Axelrod,"He's doing stuff. I mean, the Justice Department just went after some real estate interests for price fixing on rents. The FTC just issued a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain issues from the pandemic. It turns out that they're jacking it up way beyond what their costs increases were. They're fighting these fights, but not really highlighting them to the degree I would in a campaign like this. Bottom line, be more like Joe from Scranton and less like President Biden from Washington. Put yourself on the side- because those are the voters, Bill, who are going to decide this election; working class people, Black, white, and Hispanic, who are very much scuffling still in an economy that's improved, but in which cost of living has aggregated and continues to be an obstacle. It's just so hard when you're the incumbent president and incumbent president's team to get them not to defend their record. Let's put it this way, not to have them ... They want to spend 80% of their time defending their record and explaining why they're doing better than anyone realizes, and 20% of the time talking about what they still want to do in the second term and so forth. Of course, what you're saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this- I don't even.."
428pmPeywx8,3860,Doug Sosnik,"But the last thing I'll say is, I do agree with what you said about Whitmer and Newsom and all these people. But just to understand how it got there. It was 15 years of being at a political wilderness for Democrats following the 2010 midterm elections, to get to a point that you could to restock a bench. Now, part of the bench got restocked in part because of what the crazy Republican right wingers did in power. So, you take a place like Michigan that is now controlled by Democrats in the governorship and the state legislature, for the first time since the mid 1980s. That's the first time Democrats have had control of the state legislature. Look what's going on in Wisconsin. So you're right about what's happening now for the Democrats. But they're coming out of a 15 year valley. And then the question of course becomes, well, let's see what they got right? It's going to start happening the day after the election, whether Biden wins or loses. And that's where you find out who people are made of. But part of the problem Democrats have had is, this whole generation of elected officials have never had the opportunity to step forward and see what they got. I mean, Bill Clinton ran in '91 for president because no one was going to run, because everyone knew Bush was going to get reelected."
LakXVibAX1J,7973,Robert Kagan,"There's some truth to that I guess, or whatever, but beneath that surface consensus, there's stuff under the surface that we sort of tend to slide over in our normal histories. Right. And well, we don't slide over it, we just don't take them very seriously. You think back how upset are we about the John Birch Society in retrospect? But President Kennedy ordered a report to say how much of a threat is the John Birch Society? And they concluded that it was a very great threat and I think therefore we tend to under... None of these movements turned into anything. And Goldwater was sort of the last gasp of this kind of conservatism. But they were fairly significant movements in their period. And if you just transpose those movements to today, then you would have what MAGA is. And so I just think, again, we lose sight of the continuity that has existed in all this period. And Josh Hawley and Marjorie Taylor Greene and other people complain about the ""uniparty,"" which is to say that they don't think there has been a difference between a Republican Party of say John McCain or Mitt Romney or even George W. Bush on the one hand, and the Democrats on the other, people like this have been complaining about the uniparty for decades."
XY3VMVItP-A,5792,Invisible Rulers,"Because this anti-vaccine group account that I had, as I mentioned, it did not type in the word Pizzagate. It did not type in the word QAnon. It did not type in the word chemtrails. So everything was being pushed to it. And that's the part that I think is really interesting. It's the signal that you get from piquing somebody's curiosity with something that they're likely to be interested in, and that's where you get at the question of what is the ethical way for a platform to weight something when it's making a proactive suggestion to you? Yeah, that's so interesting. I hadn't really understood that the proactivity, if that's a word, of what was even, let's call it ""a neutral."" I mean, I don't mean that in a technical sense, but it's not trying to promote QAnon, as opposed to, I don't know, liberal Christianity. RENÉE DIRESTA: But this is what people... It does it because the algorithm knows that it will pay off. RENÉE DIRESTA: It makes a bunch of suggestions. It's like it offers you a platter of food, and there's salad maybe, but there's donuts too, right? This is why... But it doesn't even, it doesn't offer you, I mean, just to take that... RENÉE DIRESTA: There's not very much salad. There's a lot of donuts."
jmVR_rrjr2u,6982,Tom Tugendhat,"Well, yeah. And I went to Ukraine for their Independence Day, actually. And one of the reasons I went is because some people, I think you are one of those nations, seem to value your independence day very highly. You got your independence off some very, very fine people, but the Ukrainians got their independence off a totalitarian dictatorship and have quite rightly valued it very highly. This was their 31st anniversary, and it's an anniversary that's marked with quite a lot of darkness as well, of course, because it's the six month anniversary of the latest round of invasions. I say the latest because of course Russia has been intervening in Ukraine ever since their independence 31 years ago. And of course, most famously in 2014 actually invaded Crimea and the Donbas, and so has been there. But most famously, this year, on the 24th of February, so six months before the Independence Day, Russian troops tried to encircle and capture Kyiv, and thank God, failed, not just down to their own incompetence, although that was an important element, but down to the extraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people and some fantastic leadership by President Volodymyr Zelensky. So it was a hell of a thing to be there for their independence day this year, as you can imagine. And it was very moving to be with some very, very brave people."
8GDyKNhTKxn,9430,Mark Esper,"February of 22. And now we've been fighting, they've been fighting for two plus years now. So it's very, very real. And it matters because we're really in an era of the autocracies versus the democracies. And the democracies are led, should be led by the United States of America. And the autocracies are led by Beijing and Moscow. And we're back to where we were when I entered West Point in 1982, we're back in a pseudo-Cold War with these major powers. And so I think it's time for us to really take on the mantle of leadership. What President Ronald Reagan... I consider myself a Reagan Republican, what he charged us all to do, and he and President George HW Bush eventually won the Cold War through that type of leadership. I think we need to get back to that. Yeah. I mean, Putin in a way, it's not worse than the Cold War because obviously that was a nuclear showdown between us and the Soviet Union. Russia is different, but the direct invasion of a neighbor that was pretty, the Soviets preserved their Warsaw Pact, I guess they invaded their Warsaw Pact ""allies"" to keep them in the pact, but they didn't really- They owned Ukraine then. What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think."
8TirZC_yUmj,7851,A.B. Stoddard,"Is that your sense? Right. Not all- The closer they are to the voters, the more nervous they are. Exactly. So if you're from a safe district, you're like, ""He's going to lose again. It's going to be awesome. We're going to take the House back and be in the majority."" And if you saw what happened in New York, let's say in 2022, basically tipping the majority to the Republicans in seats that they lost because Kathy Hochul ignored crime and gave herself a competitive election. And Lee Zeldin was a good candidate and surged a bunch of turnout among Republicans and swing voters, and they picked up some seats. Look, there's a reason to be nervous, and enough people are feeling that reason, I'm just saying. I do want to give you that caveat that there's so much dismissal like, oh, it'll be the fifth election that they lose with Trump. And that could be true. I just don't buy that it's a slam dunk for Biden at all. His numbers are terrible. Low turnout for Democrats will be the key to Trump's victory because there's apathy in the coalition. They have erosion with Asians, erosion with Black voters, erosion with Latino voters. And Biden's support among Black voters has dropped 30% in two years. This is really horrible."
gjHD86-W8NE,3663,Doug Sosnik,"And then if you look a few weeks before that is the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and so I think in August is going to be the real truth test for people about what they're going to do. Interesting. Yeah, you're right. I hadn't really focused on the... I've thought a lot about the current calendar and the primary. I want to ask you about it briefly as we wrap up. The primary. What would happen if Biden steps aside? I've thought of a fair amount about the primary calendar. I thought a fair amount about the ballot access challenges for independent candidates and third parties, which are not actually as prohibitive as people think, and I'm not a big fan of the third party option. God knows after 2016, I just think people here in DC underestimated a little how much sentiment there would be out there, but maybe it would dissipate. It would be a lot of excitement in April, and then by June [inaudible]. Well, I think a lot of it would depend on who it is. Yeah. Yeah. And the third party candidacies historically that had an impact were kind of like movement candidacies. Wallace in '68, which is the last time a third party candidate carried states, I mean, regardless of what you thought of his politics, he had clear politics."
3RKR162X625,5682,Aaron Friedberg,"And the fact that the world seemed safer by November '88 when George H.W. Bush was running to succeed Reagan, then it had probably in '80 or '84, maybe a little less concerned about things blowing up, literally. On the other hand, they also thought, A, the world remains dangerous and B, politically, we need to make the case that it's dangerous. That's why you need Bush experienced tough foreign policy and not Michael Dukakis. And so they had that famous bear in the woods ad, do you remember? Which was a pretty kind of Cold War, be worried about the Russian Bear ad. But I think responsible leaders, probably from Truman on through Reagan and Bush and really Clinton sort of, and into post- Cold War sort of had to balance this, we need to be strong, we need to be the pillar of this whole international order or things could get very, very dangerous. And there are people out there trying to make it more dangerous at the bear in the woods. But on the other hand, I'm the incumbent president, so things have gotten a little better. I feel like Biden's maybe aired a little bit more on the- Yes. ...Things are getting better side of it. And it puts Harris in a slightly tricky position here, I think."
A3I-aWE1hwe,3112,David Axelrod,"Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined, for the second time on these conversations, by my friend David Axelrod, a man with many titles. We were joking about this, CNN commentator, Hacks on Tap podcast host, founding director of the Institute of Politics. I had the pleasure to serve on that advisory board with him where he did an excellent job for 10 years at the University of Chicago. Probably tougher to manage the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago than run a couple of presidential campaigns, right? Well. Students, faculty, all those people. Actually, easier than many, easier than most. I can point to a few institutions, including the one you attended, where I think it would be more difficult. No, no. I give Chicago credit for making it a hospitable environment and one where... and you insisted on real free speech and civil discourse. It was very appreciated. I should point out that Bill Kristol has been an eminent board member of the IOP from its inception, and we try and reflect his temperament and civic values. I rubber stamp David's decisions, but that's what board members are for, of course. Most importantly, for this conversation, obviously, and most famously the top campaign strategist and President Barack Obama's-Senator Obama's-2008 campaign for the presidency, and then his successful reelection in 2012, which is really what I want to focus on today."
DSS1GnkbX-A,9262,James Carville,"How would you advise her to deal with that? Either 2019 and/or 2020. There's a minor fact, and I would bring it up. The crime rate since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's second office has plummeted. Yes, historic numbers. I don't quite know what you're talking about, but we took over a high crime country under the administration of Donald Trump, which by the way, became a high crime country under the administration of Donald Trump. I think we can definitely talk about that. The Democratic-parts of the Democratic Party, not Joe Biden, not Democratic primary voters, decidedly not-lost their minds. And everybody thought this was the wave of the future. The identity politics is being essential to any discussion of politics. And of course it was a giant mistake. She bought into that. As did other people. Whoever advised her in 2019, I hope to throw them all out in the Pacific Ocean. And to a guy like me, you could see this coming. So I went backed and looked in April 27th, 2021, I did an interview on Vox and I said, ""This stuff is killing us. This is the dumbest thing that you can imagine."" And I'll give myself credit. I was right. I call ""defund the police"" the three stupidest words in the history of the English language."
kcqwtN6yXlF,6315,Jack Goldsmith,"So that was a hugely important reform that did happen in the last four years, and there were some smaller ones as well. There were some important in the weeds, Inspector General reform. There were some important, in my world, reform of transparency of international agreements. But the core issues about conflict of interest, about obstruction of justice, about tax disclosure, about justice department independence, electoral interference... There are a whole set of laws maybe reforming the pardon power, which you can do at the margins, none of these things got any traction. Yeah. I was going to ask what the particulars were, we just went through them briefly and we can come back to them as is appropriate. The pardon power particularly, you'd think since both sides are now unhappy about the uses of the pardon power, it'll just... I don't know. I'd be curious... I mean, it just seems like it's become something that it was not intended to be. It's pretty hard to make the case it is good for the country really, or good for mercy or good for national comedy or the various reasons the president had this extraordinary power and was given it. And also has been used in ways that even previous presidents have somewhat bent, you might say, the intention. This has gone further."
FzXkiA0aC1Q,3346,Doug Sosnik,"I mean, you've been through so many of these. Give us the briefing. Well, I think if you think about where we are today compared to the last time we spoke in early June, I would say two things that are kind of cross currents. One is in one way the race hasn't really changed in the senses that both Biden and Trump have obviously solidified their positions as the likely nominees. And I think there was probably a fair amount of skepticism back last June about whether these two guys would actually emerge out of this process and be the nominees. And it appears they are, and I think for different reasons, by the way. I think Trump is going to be nominee largely because of his support with the base of the party. And despite the fact there are a lot of Republicans who don't really want to support him, they feel forced to because they fear the political retribution of Republicans at the base level. And in the case of Biden, his ability to go through a primary without a serious opponent is largely due not to the base, but to the political elites in the party who decided that it's less of a risk to have Biden running again against Trump than it would be to have an open primary."
It1p6DGX4RA,7682,Robert Kagan,"When I write histories I write them forwards and try to understand, get into the... but this time I was trying to answer a question. And the question is, why are so many people supporting a guy who evidently wishes to overthrow the nature of our system? A guy who has proven to be willing to be a dictator. And I think that part of the answer is that a very large number of people, larger than we may have thought, really does want to change the nature of our system. And I don't mean change it from the Democratic Party, but change the system that the founders created. Some people are very frank about this, people like Patrick Deneen, people like Adrian Vermeule at Harvard, people who call themselves post-liberals. They are actively opposed to the founders' liberalism. And I think that a lot of people wouldn't articulate it that way. They may not even realize they're opposed to the founders' liberalism. But a lot of people who I think are fairly characterized as white nationalists, or at least certainly have an ethno-religious interpretation of what America is, that is an alternative to the founders' universalist vision. And so I think we have to accept that people are not just stumbling, blindly following Trump. There is a real movement, a very powerful movement, that supports Trump, that really would like to see a change in the way America operates."
U4topv03peb,9167,Mark Esper,"And why is that? I go back to the basics, right? When I came into office as Secretary of Defense, I said that my top priority would be implementing the National Defense Strategy. And the core assumption of the National Defense Strategy was we're now in this era of great power competition where our adversaries were no longer terrorist groups and insurgencies. They would still be there, but our number one concern should be China, then Russia. That's how I prioritized them. And that we would face an era where both countries would become far more aggressive. And at that point in time, as you know, Russia had already invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. So I began my tenure doing a number of things, reviewing our war plans with regard to both countries, trying to support our allies, moving troops to Europe, moving forces to Europe because my view was, it was only a matter of time. And unfortunately, we were proven right. President Putin, Vladimir Putin, invades Ukraine, trying to seize Kyiv in a matter of days in what? February of 22. And now we've been fighting, they've been fighting for two plus years now. So it's very, very real. And it matters because we're really in an era of the autocracies versus the democracies. And the democracies are led, should be led by the United States of America."
B10wjY-gByF,6525,A.B. Stoddard,"Biden was a relief. He was rescuing the country from Trump. Biden's the incumbent now. He's not rescuing the country from Trump. He's going to campaign, he's going to talk that way. And you and I see it that way, but to the average American, it's like, no, no, no, you had your chance. Everything costs more now. There's been a lot of change. ChatGPT, things are coming at me. I'm very unhappy. And so he is not coming out of left field. He's the sitting president. It's very different. And I always like to remind people that woman in the suburbs who has a college degree or more degrees and came out to vote against Donald Trump, she's coming back out. She's never going to stop coming out. Young people are very energized about guns and abortion. They are not energized against Trump. They don't lie in bed at night and worry about Donald Trump and democracy. Unfortunately, they just don't. If they are the politically involved, politically informed young person, they turned out in the midterms, they're going to turn out in the presidential. It doesn't mean that all the kids my kids' age are going to vote because they're tuned out of politics. They think it's insane, and they prefer not to know anything about it. And they don't follow the news, and they're horrified."
sNJ4OJeapv1,3144,David Axelrod,"Really thanks a lot for this very insightful and thought provoking conversation. It was fun, always fun. Thank you, David Axelrod, and thank you for joining us on Conversations ."
d6oOe40uKtJ,2948,David Axelrod,"Anything magic about... You need to both get them back, get the percentages back closer to where they were in 2020 and get them to vote also. Right. There are two problems. I think two things. I think the comparative is really important here. And secondly, I do think, Bill, the war has been very, very damaging. I think the economic issues are primary in many ways, but the war has been very, very damaging, and it's something that has been worked on relentlessly on TikTok and Instagram. I suspect that some of the forces working it are not domestic political parties but maligned foreign interests, but it has the level of discord about it among young people. Let me say, I haven't had this discussion with you, but I think you can hold two thoughts at once. I do. I'm the son of a Jewish refugee who knew violence and death as a child, and I'm strongly pro- Israel, and I mean my sense of horror and outrage and indignation about October 7th was as strong as anyone's. That said, I still weep when I see a starving Palestinian child, I still weep when I see families destroyed. And I think the passion of these young people... Some of it is misinformed, some of it is unfair, but a lot of it is them reacting to what they're seeing."
5DW6Z6LgpUP,5712,Aaron Friedberg,"Whereas based on everything Trump has said about foreign policy, to the extent that it's coherent, and if you actually read the transcripts of some of these interviews, they're not coherent at all. I think would lead to the conclusion that what he really believes is the America First, isolationist, protectionist, anti- immigration view that I suspect would emerge triumphant if he gets another crack at the White House. We'll see what happens in five weeks. But thank you for really explaining, I think, what's at stake in foreign policy in this election, but also how to think about the world and how to think about the world after November 5th, as well as over the next five weeks. So Aaron Friedberg, thank you very much for joining me again. Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
pQbGkpHJwLz,7827,Robert Kagan,"If you go back and read the comments of the Imperial Grand Wizard in the 1920s, he sounds like a MAGA politician now, and he sounds like Donald Trump really talking about how the whites are being mistreated in America today. And that is Donald Trump's number one selling point. So I think in a certain sense we need to grow up and realize that this is a conflicted society we live in. We like to believe that we're all basically on the same page and we disagree about policies and how to get there, but I think the point is we do not agree on what, ""there,"" is. We do not agree on where we're trying to go, and that is the fight that we're having in the 2024 election, even though it seems like a traditional battle between Democrats and Republicans. I know it doesn't seem that way to you, but it seems that way to a lot of Republicans apparently, and they don't realize that what's up for grabs is actually the nature of our system. I want to get back to this really important point you made quickly about the elites and... Well, I won't get back to it, let's talk about that for a minute then. I do want to come to the contrast with '24 in terms of the party alignment in a certain way because in the 1920s there was sort of elements of this reaction or this anti-liberalism, let's just use that term, in both parties, which both made it stronger in a way, more pervasive but maybe weaker because now it's one party mostly, but it's a party that is half the country."

So there's a practical, why don't you talk about this as I just said it, and why don't we talk about, there's a kind of political sciencey difference you might say. I'm not sure which way it cuts honestly in terms of the danger, or the threat, or the power of the anti-liberal forces. Well, one of the things that requires answering is, well, how did the Republican Party get to be what it is today? And I think the answer to that is fundamentally political/demographic and the sorting of the two parties, which really does begin in this pre-war period when a very large percentage of the immigrants who come into the United States from Europe, from those parts of Europe that people don't want them coming from, are settling in Eastern cities for the most part, and are becoming part of what are then Democratic Party machines."
i8ruX_2a1vu,8205,Mark Esper,"There is a degree of vetting where- That's an unusual statement by a Sec staff. That's really nice of you to say that. I'm going to bounce the equation here in a second. There is a role for the White House. It's fine. They're looking out for the president's interests. They're doing a second check. That's fine. I'm not going to argue with that. But I will not be the first Sec Def to complain as I did oftentimes, and as I talk about my book, of meddling in the internal affairs of the Pentagon, trying to get too involved, particularly from the National Security Council, particularly from the national security advisor, that's a constant problem. My view is that the National Security Council staff is too big. It needs to be shrunk down some. But look, at the end of the day, my sense was always that the administrations that run best are the ones that pick good cabinet secretaries, good deputy secretaries, good top-tier people and let them run their departments consistent with what the president has laid out in both his campaign and in his various strategy and policy documents. When you start getting meddling from the White House, you're really eroding the authority and ability of the departments to move quickly and effectively to implement the president's agenda."
L-XUh5eLR1J,16898,Anne Applebaum,"And that's from somebody who- they'd just been negotiating with the Americans in Riyadh. So the Russians aren't showing any indication that they want to stop. But the Ukrainians are able to hit thousands of Russian targets every month. I've seen the list of what they can hit. They are killing far more, something like seven to one. So they kill seven times more Russians than Ukrainians. They are in a position to continue fighting, I would guess, for at least six months and maybe a year without that much more help. So it's not as dire as you think. I mean, the thing that worries me the most about Ukraine is a psychological, what will it mean to Ukrainians if the US government turns on them? Will people become demoralized? That I just don't know. Wars have also psychological elements, and the Ukrainians, that's why they pushed back against the Russians in 2022. This is why Kiev wasn't taken because the Ukrainians said, ""No, we're brave and we're going to stop them,"" and they did. And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards."
wPYb5JlnhGV,6022,Tom Tugendhat,"But it feels to me, and I talked to someone from one of the countries who said, this there's a huge amount of coordination going on, but a lot of it's going on in informal groupings or sub... All the 30 members of NATO. I mean, it's not as if Brussels is the center, I don't think, of... And that may be a good thing, incidentally, that it's sort of what happens when you're in a new historical moment. New things, new people get together, and maybe it's not formalized at first, and it could be formalized. Am I right about that though? Is it sort of... I go back to the joke in Moscow. At the moment, it's being told in Moscow where Putin goes and sees generals and says, ""How's this war against NATO going?"" And the general says, ""Well, we've been at war for six months. We've lost 20,000 soldiers, a thousand artillery pieces, a hundred aircraft. We are being pushed back on various fronts and it's costing us hundreds of men a day."" ""And what about NATO?"" ""Oh well, NATO hasn't entered the war yet."" And I think it's actually a huge success of NATO that what NATO is enabling is an enormous amount of bilateral cooperation, none of which is actually direct NATO versus Russia conflict, which means that at no stage can Russia claim that this is a NATO operation because it isn't."
bEb4GNxn4GA,7889,James Carville,"We'd obviously be glad to discuss that up and coming debate with Donald Trump, June 27th, CNN. Be there, be square. We're looking forward to it and we're looking forward to having another big debate so people can see where we are in this thing. Yeah, I think that gives you some lift because you know he don't want to do it. Yeah. You could even release some questions ahead of time that you give Donald Trump the advantage of knowing what you're going to tell him about the courts or whatever. Yeah, yeah. And they're gimmicks, right? They don't seem to use gimmicks. I don't know why not. Gimmicks are kind of useful in campaigns, I think. I mean, gimmicks are not unimportant in campaigns, right? You got to bring this stuff home somehow, and they just seem, that's what, I guess what I am slightly... I don't know, Gimmicks and soundbites. I always tell people there's one soundbite that would supplant all of the combined wisdom in the world. Love your neighbor as yourself. Give me anything more profound than that with deeper meaning, with... treat others as you want to be treated yourself. That the general concept of the golden rule, it's a breathtakingly good soundbite. It's very short, takes no time, and everybody understands the implications of it all."
7SeTm30oIa0,8748,Robert Kagan,"It isn't just steady progress. And what undid that triumph of white anti-liberalism were events, not just education, or not even... people didn't change. The Depression discredited the Republican and conservative movement, followed by World War II, which discredited racism, and really led to a huge flowering of liberalism in the wake of what had been a very dominant anti-liberal 1920s. Your discussion of the Klan is so interesting. I just had never focused. I assumed it was still southern, still race-focused as it had been in the 1880s and '90s and all. And it still is somewhat that way, but the degree to which it's strong in the north, strong nationally, as you point out in the book, and you quote people contemporaneously at the time, unselfconsciously, incidentally. Not embarrassed about it. It's sort of like today, you say, ""I'm proud to be MAGA."" You know? Right. And they were happy to be in the Klan. And it was a networking thing and so forth. The whole '24 Democratic Convention turns on a refusal, if I'm not mistaken, to repudiate the Klan by one of our two major parties. Right, right. The Democratic Party could not repudiate the Klan. And so all that's happening, and Americans are capable of living in a society where that kind of prejudice is rampant."
owAnHYx2ouQ,3678,Eric Edelman,"They hosted the Taliban for years as well. Yeah. Okay, that's all, I would say, legitimate debate. What's really striking about Trump is there's no evidence that any of that is being factored in, right? It's about the plane, as you say. He emphasizes and emphasized in one or two of the speeches in the region how much this is about him and his personal relationships to the sheikhs and the emirs. It's not state-to-state, it's really... People sometimes say, ""Well, Trump's realpolitik compared to neocons like us, who care more about values, I suppose,"" and I suppose what we do about... And human rights. But this isn't Henry Kissinger doing complicated state realpolitik statecraft, right? Trump really... Anyway, I just was struck by that part of it in all three countries. Yeah. As I said, the trip was largely kind of geoeconomic, but there were some geopolitical overtones that came up during the trip, which we can get into. But before we do that, I think to take the geoeconomics on its own merits. To your point, if you look at the fact sheets that were put out by the White House about each of the stops. So in Riyadh, the Saudis promised $600 billion in investment, the Qataris offered I think 1.2 billion, and then the Emiratis offered about 200 billion in AI deals, joint investments in artificial intelligence, which total up to roughly $2 billion worth of trade and investment."
4WjMdm_rG2k,3545,David Axelrod,"They prefer not to have Biden or Trump. Let's be fair. There's too much possibility for third- and fourth-party candidates to get votes even if they- As we've seen, as we've seen, I mean Trump was president because of it. That is the exact scenario that elected him in 2016. I'll let you go, but anything we should look for in the next few? I mean in your campaign I think the conventional view was, and I think you thought this was right and you planned it this way, that you could do a lot of damage to Romney and set up the contrast early. In the spring. We're not that early now, but we are in this kind of spring/summer period before the conventions. Conventional view is often save it all for the last two months, but how important are the next two, three months? I think they are important. First of all, I think what happens in the fall is that there's such saturation coverage in all different mediums that paid media is less effective than it is earlier. I would expect both the Biden campaign and the Biden super PAC or super PACs to be very active in the spring and really push some of these comparative arguments and try and knock Trump down a few points."
I1uZBQBQEaG,6125,Invisible Rulers,"RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, the technology is just going to keep changing. But what we see, you don't think we're having on the verge of another fundamental change like we had in the '90s and 2000s? RENÉE DIRESTA: Oh, I mean- Every now and then you get the, well, then we'll have augmented reality and Zuckerberg's investing in the Ray-Bans and things. AR has always been, or VR has been the next big thing for 30 years now. Who knows if it'll actually get anywhere? But no, I think this information environment is really important. Getting people participating and thinking in terms of how do you get messages out and capture attention? And the most important part is that networked process, where people share each other's content and move things along to make sure that messages reach people. That's the part where I think institutions haven't really invested in being a part of that process, and that's what needs to happen. No, that's really- RENÉE DIRESTA: Credible information out there. People do still have a wishing away of the problem or it'll take care of itself. And I think what you're saying is- RENÉE DIRESTA: Or it's some- It is what it is and it's got, of course, pluses and minuses. But if we don't get serious about some of the minuses or about at least understanding better what we're seeing out there, we have a big problem."
8kI2sWjgguh,16222,Anne Applebaum,"We don't know if US policy is going to go even worse or go slightly backwards, a tiny bit towards a less radical version of Trump-Vance-ism or whatever. But I mean, say what you think would actually... You've been in Kiev several times. What will happen over the next several months in the actual war in your judgment, or could happen? Obviously I don't know what's going to happen, but I think that- Right. No. But I mean, how dire is the situation? There are some aspects of the war that I don't think are well understood. So, this is a drone war. It's a war in which tanks, the big thing that the US can deliver and there was a big argument about whether the US should give them or not a couple of years ago. Tanks, I won't say they're useless, but they're not as useful as we thought they would be. And generally speaking, big, sophisticated, expensive pieces of equipment, maybe with some exceptions of defense equipment-air defense-turn out to be less useful than we thought as well. It doesn't mean they're useless, but this is a drone war. When I first went to Kiev, I went to Kiev in April 2022, six weeks after the invasion, to interview Zelensky with the editor of The Atlantic , Jeff Goldberg."
zqCVujm_ShP,6910,Jack Goldsmith,"He had been Sect F before, 25 years before. He had been on various congressional and other commissions in the 90s on intelligence and I think on defense. Again, what everyone thinks about him, you couldn't say that he... He wasn't a wrecking ball. He was a kind of wrecking ball, I think. He was a kind of wrecking ball, actually. He was a well-educated... I mean he was a- He was an informed, sophisticated, shrewd wrecking ball. Right. I don't know if that's always better, but there is some... One feels a little more, okay, he's president's choice and he's studied this stuff and he's brought in some people who studied this stuff and so let him try to make some of these reforms, and same with various CIA directors and national intelligence sections. Not that they were all perfect or anything, but mostly people with some experience in that area and so forth. Bob Gates told me, ""Look, I need to really fix..."" He did, in fact. Bob Gates overruled some of these military promotion panels. I know this a little bit because I was following things quite closely at that point in 2008-9. And the military bureaucracy didn't like the people who were doing counter-insurgency and Petraeus's kind of proteges who were part of the surge. Gates thought that was fresh thinking and I think intervened to actually get a couple of people."
wX3GnEsDrhb,3826,David Axelrod,"That's what we did in 2012. I mean, you remember, Bill, we were still very much feeling the effects of the great recession. We were out of the recession, but people still were stung by the experience of it. If we went out and claimed economic mastery, we would've lost. Interesting. But instead, we spent 14 months talking about the future and whether we're going to have an economy that works for working people, for the middle class, for people who want to be middle class, is work going to be rewarded or are we going to have an economy where only the people, only the hale and hearty succeed, and in an environment in which people are very jaundiced about Wall Street in that election? That was very important message. Romney, of course, was not well positioned to fight with us on that. I think Biden has to get himself on the right side of these, on the economic fight. They're doing stuff, and I know this is supposed to be a conversation and you put in a quarter and now you're getting 10 plays, but I'm just about done here. He's doing stuff. I mean, the Justice Department just went after some real estate interests for price fixing on rents. The FTC just issued a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain issues from the pandemic."
4IUHqf7_Ob-,6359,Jack Goldsmith,"Going back to Watergate, going back either to Ford or Carter, I can't remember. And same with conflict of interest rules, very little discussion of that. Now, it's just accepted, now, that they're not going to follow the statutory rules, almost very few of them, and none of the important ones apply to the president. So he's, by continually defying these things, then by nothing happening over the last four years, they're no longer being held up as norms. They're not even being discussed. And that's a Trump success. And the president personally has often been not covered by these rules or only covered as a matter of courtesy or norms like with the tax. But of course, we were covered. I was in the White House, and pretty strictly, I've got to say, this was still many years ago, so it was fairly recently after Watergate and so forth. And every time, this is very what strikes me, having gone through my pathetically small earnings disclosures and being careful to put them in mutual funds, because I didn't want anyone to say that I'd heard something that might lead me to buy some stock with my $2,000 worth of stock or something. And now Elon Musk is going to apparently, I don't know, have a roaming all over the government trying to find savings and efficiencies, which that's fine."
B92MSYorPgY,6322,Tom Tugendhat,"I mean, a country can't stay at war like this and maintain an economy. I mean, you just can't, right? And so, those countries that aren't able to supply weapons should be thinking very seriously about loan agreements. We paid off our martial debt, I think I'm right in saying, under the Blair administration. It took us 70 or 80 years to pay off the debt that we accrued to you in the second World War, but I have to say, I was very glad when we paid off the last penny, and it was money well spent. And I'm sure the Ukrainians will feel the same, and we must make sure that where we can, we're generous, and where we can't, we make the loans as long as possible, because I think that's really important. But look, I also think the next thing to do is to help in other ways, because the reality is that the Ukrainians have gone from literally sending every person to the border to guard, to fight, to now going into a stage where they need to sustain operations over a much longer basis. That means changing the way that you do supplies, and repairs, and training, and any number of different things to go from an army, to being a sort of best effort engagement, to a sustainable engagement."

I don't know what it is. But his outbursts over the weekend just remind people that the guy is nuts, and living with him is like a... I saw some guy in a focus group say, he was a guy who voted for Trump before, but said he couldn't again, and he said, ""Trump as president is like having a neighbor who runs a jackhammer 24 hours a day,"" he says, ""Just exhausting."" And so, I think there's some element of that that will erode some of these gauzy memories. But I think the Biden campaign has to remind people, and you and I, we may have a difference of opinion on this particular piece of policy, but the one signature achievement of the Trump administration was a $1.7 trillion tax cut that primarily favored corporations and wealthy people. Right. It is the single most negative thing, up there with abortion rights, but it is more broadly impactful. And you talk about that, his inaction on pharmaceutical prices, a whole range of issues on which, on economics, he's just in the wrong place. And if there is a presumption that goes to Joe Biden for having some sense of the way real people, or average people, live..."
2XMkmkxx-S_,5286,Tom Tugendhat,"The kind of healthy coordination and multiplication of efforts that's neither, let's have another meeting at the NATO headquarters with 30 people sitting around a table on the one hand, or entirely just bilateral Ukraine to Poland, Ukraine to Czech, Ukraine to [inaudible]. So that's impressive if that's the case, right? For all the talk of, ""Oh, Europe's terrible, and NATO's terrible. It's all falling apart"" and all, it seems like it's pretty robust here, and pretty intelligently robust, if you know what I mean? Yeah. Look, I think this is a mature way of dealing with an alliance. Some alliances feel that unless you put the brand of the organization on everything, you are not doing anything. Well, I think in a mature relationship, you don't need to own it. What's the old... Was it Harry Truman? I can't remember. One of your presidents who said it's amazing what you can get done if you don't care who takes credit, and I think that's one of those great lines. Yeah. Don't you think also that the example of countries working together under this broad rubric might be applicable to many other situations and also elsewhere in the world? I mean, 20 years ago-maybe you were involved in some of these conversations-there was talk, ""How can we really confront China without an Asian NATO?"" But maybe we don't need an Asian NATO."

They're getting rich on a crypto scheme, the family's making whatever they need to make while all these programs are being decimated and vets are being fired and everything."" So he was sort of the only one in the beginning out of the gate being articulate. I see other voices making an attempt. Seth Moulton, Jason Crow, they're both members of Congress who are veterans. They've been pretty brave. Senator Mark Kelly's been out there sticking his neck out as well. And I am impressed that they've come together and tried in the face of Republicans canceling town halls, to coordinate a strategy-because this party's not coordinated right now-to coordinate a strategy of going to Republican districts and holding their own Democratic town halls and calling out Republicans for being cowards. ""They don't want to face you. They're too scared of you. They let Elon run wild and basically they've abdicated their responsibility to Elon in terms of the power of the [inaudible] congress."" That's incredibly effective, I think, the fact that they're doing that. Everything else makes me worry. The new DNC chair Ken Martin is saying things like, ""Oh, our message is fine. We just need to connect it to the voters."" Like, no, their message is not fine. There's a lot of hesitance."
BA9gLnpldS7,16555,Anne Applebaum,"I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress? And I'm the last person to put any hopes in them at this point, but half of them did vote for aide for Ukraine less than a year ago. Are they literally going to, just because Trump decides he's... Not decides. Trump has been a friend of Putin's and remains a friend of Putin's so to speak, or an ally Putin's almost. Are they simply going to give up on that? It wouldn't take that many Republicans to join the Democrats to conceivably stop Trump from doing a [aid] package, even? I guess I'm slightly more hopeful than some people that... I mean, generally presidents have a huge amount of power on foreign policy, very hard to override them when they're going at a certain direction. And sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time, it's very bad, I think. But I don't know. So for whatever it's worth my sense of if it could snowball in a very bad direction, or the opposite could happen. If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful."
ZEeiKF9FGoL,6694,AB Stoddard,"And then secondly, there's a 2027, 2028 agenda, which is obviously finding a good nominee or a good cast of candidates from whom to choose a nominee, fixing ""the Democratic brand"" in the Bill Clinton way as he did in '91, '92. I was thinking about that analogy. I've said they all want to be Clinton. That was a good example of defeating an incumbent president who had looked very strong. Republicans had won three elections in a row. But the Democrats in Congress in '89, '90 did damage to Bush... and '91, they didn't have any great Democratic brand. They just fought Bush on a lot of issues and caused trouble for the Bush administration. God knows it wasn't like the Trump administration. Anyway, I do, I feel like the Democrats, it's in a way attribute to them. They're kind of earnest, they want to govern well, so they want to have a lot of seminars about, ""Ultimately we have to be for reform, but we also have to defend the institutions."" That's all correct, but they're a little... for now, I think they could be more of an opposition party, honestly. And I guess we'll see if they go in that direction. And also knock Trump's-let's get to the Republicans and close with them-but if they knock Trump's numbers down, the argument's always been maybe you get four Republican senators, four Republican house members to jump ship on some votes at least."
haSlDD1Kv7S,8532,A.B. Stoddard,"To get away with as much as he can. It's to get away with things. And he's gotten away with January 6th, and the plotting of a coup. He's gotten away with being found potentially... first, he stole documents, classified documents from the White House, but potentially he obstructed justice and caused his lawyers to lie and everything. The more this builds, the more intense the support. And the establishment and the elites, who are not in the 2024 field but are connected to the donors in this deep sense of fear about Donald Trump being their nominee, are still powerless in the face of his strength. Okay, well, there's a lot there. So let's unpack that a little. I mean, A, do you take it that DeSantis is close to being the only alternative to Trump? That, I mean, it's sort of 90% that it's one of the two of them, 95%... I mean, you think it is? Do you think no one's going to come from 4% and have a dramatic run and upset both of the people ahead of them, ahead of that person? This is an amazing thing that you look at the same polls I do that Pence and Haley are always number three and four, which is stunning to me. I understand the appeal of Nikki Haley."
N3RhuzuFzGY,5620,Larry Summers,"But we weren't in some kind of imminent danger. And I think what has happened is in a general environment where we don't have that much room for error, we've started making huge scale error in terms of our attitude towards the rest of the world, our unpredictability, our potential hostility to investors in our currency. And so major errors starting from a limited room for error environment have brought us to the point where we are very, very much on the edge. And what is very important to note in thennow nearly a month since ""Liberation Day,"" is that there is no evidence, zero, of markets accommodating themselves to these policies. All the good news when there has been good news has come from a sense that there's going to be a policy reversal. None of it has come from a sense that, ""Well, we really are going to impose the tariffs. There really is going to be some kind of American renaissance."" Zero of it has that character. All of it is, ""Well, maybe they won't go through with this crazy stuff, maybe they'll back off here. Look, they backed off there. Look, they're sending signals that they're just going to declare victory and not do anything real."" So that is the disturbing thing. And these things can tip very quickly."
LTB_br1n_v7,8664,Mark Esper,"So those are unknowns that we should be concerned about as this election unfolds. They're unknowns, but my feeling is the odds are pretty good that it would tip much more to the kinds of people he put in after you left and after John Bolton left and after Bill Barr left even, justice, as opposed to you guys, in a sense, I think he thinks you, and he said this, that you all constrained him and didn't let him really pursue the America first agenda and all that. Yeah, look, loyalty will be the number one attribute. And look, when you take these jobs, there is a degree of loyalty, support of the President that comes with it. But it's not unconditional, it's not unqualified. Your first loyalty is to the Constitution, to the American people, which is kind of how I drew my lines. But I think his standard is loyalty to him no matter what, no matter the issue. And so the question will be is who does he bring in? And if that's the type of people they are, what is going to bind them? At least in the military, you have a professional military class who understands what its ethics are, what the norms are, the proper behavior between civilians and the military, and I think they will hold the line."
knx9Eh1WUyN,3627,Doug Sosnik,"I don't know. But that Biden running for reelection again, I won't obsess on this, is sort of putting a cork over that. I do feel like, yeah, there's a real kind of... And the question would be, is removing that cork healthier now or not? And obviously it's unlikely to happen, so we're going to have to wait. But I don't know. That's an interesting question of how much... Is there a healthy democratic party beneath the surface? But there still will be fights as you say, on a whole bunch of issues. I mean for me as a foreign policy hawk, it's encouraging to see how many Hubert Humphrey or even Scoop Jackson Democrats there are floating around in Congress apparently. They're all voting for aid to Ukraine, and the Republicans are opposing it. On the other hand, a lot of my friends think, ""oh, the Left's got all the momentum and the energy among young people. So I think you're right, the Democrats have to resolve their future, but also the Trump side is kind of unstable, right? I mean, ultimately Trumpism is not, it's not clear that it's a stable movement. It's more of a movement and less of a coalition. So I guess both parties could be... I mean, 2025 could be a very interesting year no matter who wins on both sides."
g8TaBm1MiR1,14012,Anne Applebaum,"And I expect that to last and to become a way of doing business. I mean, okay, Viktor Orbán doesn't want to join us or, I don't know, some newly elected leader somewhere else gets cold feet. Well, then the coalition of the willing is going to move forward anyway, and you're going to see a lot more of that action. They do understand, I think, the need to work together. I mean, everybody now has the feeling in Europe that we somehow missed a moment. So we now have the US as a quasi-authoritarian power. We have China as an authoritarian power. We have Russia as an authoritarian power. And Europe, unless it acts jointly, and unless it finds a way to channel its economic strength, I think the European Union as a single thing is the largest economy in the world, largest or second largest. Unless they find a way of channeling that and using their economic strength and translating that into some kind of geopolitical strategy, then they're just going to be chopped up and eaten up by the others. I mean, I think that there's an understanding of that. But as I said, in every country you have the counterforce, sometimes directly supported by Russia, sometimes with direct links to the MAGA wing of the Republican Party."
IqLuqiScjBM,3814,Eric Edelman,"So I saw just before coming on with you a story, I think it was in Bloomberg, saying that Europeans are stunned by Trump's phone call in which he basically said, ""Great phone call. The two sides are going to get together to talk about a ceasefire."" Which people had called for already, and so now they're going to be... Instead of having a ceasefire and talking about a peace deal, now they're going to be talking about a ceasefire. The Russian readout of the call was a little different. It quoted Putin as saying, ""Well, we're going to talk about all this and see if we can reach agreement, but we have to deal with the root causes of all this."" And that's just code, in Putin speak, for an independent Ukraine oriented to the West with security guarantees, et cetera. Basically suggesting that he hasn't budged an inch from his minimalist demands. The Europeans are saying, after all the effort they've made in the last couple of weeks to tee up Trump to become irritated by Putin's unwillingness to actually come to the table despite Zelensky's frequently expressed offers to come to the table, that would then lead to some pressure or sanctions on Putin. Apparently in the phone call that the Europeans had with Trump after his phone call with Putin, they were stunned that he is unwilling to sanction Putin."
QHqP0t2Gknt,2472,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That's a significant number of people, maybe for one particular community, but as a scale that they were not rounding up everybody. But nevertheless, the implications of enforcement operations being carried out in the area made everybody retreat home. And fear may have a bigger impact on the US and the way that fear spreads through immigrant communities than the actual enforcement operations themselves. I suppose the business community could then say, wait a second. You're damaging our ability to get the crops picked here because you had this one raid with 78 people, and meanwhile, thousands of people aren't showing up at work or something like that. Right? So that can have- Yeah, absolutely. ... its political effect. Just to be clear, US citizens, so you came over when you were 15, you were brought over when you were 12, now you're 35. You have a family, you have kids who were born here. They're not subject to that. They're US citizens. Well, tell me, what's the story with them? Well, of course, Trump is saying he's going to try to strip birthright citizenship from people. That's flagrantly unconstitutional. He can't do that. Obviously- And even he is saying, I think, that he would do it prospectively, presumably, not retroactively. Right? Yeah. Though of course, there's really no legal way that you could make that distinction, say, oh, okay, so the constitution requires you to have birthright citizenship up through January 20, 2025."
pzxQONCQTsB,3743,Eric Edelman,"And as a result, although we have targeted the Houthi leadership allegedly and killed a number of them, it's a little bit hard to evaluate the claims because CENTCOM has not provided any briefings nor has the White House, so it's been very difficult to measure by any metric the success of the campaign. Although one can certainly measure the expenditure of munitions, which has gotten to about a billion dollars to the point that people in the Pentagon were getting very nervous about shortages of munitions that might be important and necessary in an Indo-Pacific contingency, for instance. And so there clearly was a decision to call it quits, declare a victory. I think, and you and I are both old enough to remember Senator George Aiken who recommended that the United States do an, ""Elegant bug out,"" I think was his term for Vietnam. This was, I think, an elegant bug out just declaring victory, but again, done without any consultation with Israel who's also being targeted. The final piece of this US-Israel puzzle I think is that on the Syria side that we were talking about earlier, one of the things that Israel is extremely concerned about is overweening Turkish influence in Syria post-Assad. Because the Turks were the major patrons and suppliers and protectors of HTS Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is the rebranded version of the Nusra Front that Farouk al-Sharaa heads and which liberated Syria from Assad."
McArtlvNFV_,5962,Tim Snyder,"You know, Rheinmetall, one German company, is outproducing us in terms of artillery shells. The North Koreans are outlying the entire West, and we, for our own political reasons, which are unfortunately connected to Russia's political reasons, are at the moment not doing anything at all for Ukraine. So that's the subjective part and what I want to stress is that we're the weak link. America is the weak link. The Russians see us as the weak link, and unfortunately, they're correct. On the battlefield, the Ukrainians are doing, I would say surprisingly well. They've cleared out a huge swath of the Black Sea, of the Russia's Black Sea fleet, which is allowing them to supply the near East and Africa with food. They've destroyed a huge number of Russian aircraft in the last few weeks, largely, if not entirely free in the sky. The Russians are on the offensive now, but it's slow and it's costing them. So this is still a war that Ukraine can win. But whether or not they win it depends upon whether they have allies who are capable of seeing the political stakes and capable of behaving in a way which is consistent with simple military logic, which is what do you need to do to help your ally to win. And if we do finally get this aid package through and the Europeans continue to be, we can come back to this, I think in my judgment, better than they might've been standing up pretty well for Ukraine."
50cVaOqQCCw,3616,David Axelrod,"I mean, just sort of bits of Bidenisms that make Biden look both strong and rooted. So that would be one thing. He joked with him the other day about spotting him three strokes on a golf course if he would carry his own bag. I'm not sure golf is the medium or the image that I would... But a couple more, in terms of campaign, is I would very much... Plouffe said this on our conversation the other day at Arizona State University, Plouffe and Rove and I. I guess, Plouffe and Rove and me. He said that a lot of the campaign is happening below the surface. Social media, a lot of the voters who Democrats need to reach are not watching Nightly News , they're not reading newspapers; that was David's point. They are getting a lot of their information on social media. For young people, TikTok and Instagram are very important. Biden has not been very competitive there until recently. Trump, first of all, his stuff lends itself to social media, and the memes about Biden's age lend themselves to social media and so on. But Biden needs to compete on social media, and they're getting better at it. They've got to get a lot better at it. When Trump does crazy ass stuff that is in their message frame, they need to get that out fast, and they're doing more of that."
IhV3RDb7G6V,5906,Jack Goldsmith,"We'll also see if the anarchic approach to governance is going to work out for them and if they're going to have enough great lawyers to litigate all these cases to craft these laws in the right way. It's going to be law heavy and it's going to be down in the weeds, but we should expect surprises in terms of them doing novel things. We shouldn't confuse the familiar in terms of how government is organized with the necessary. There are different ways to organize the government and they're going, I predict, do some radical things that I probably can't predict and that's going to be really interesting and important to follow. That's terribly interesting and good way to close and there's also reason to get together in, I don't know, six months or so and see what things they're doing that we didn't anticipate, and whether they're sensible things that are good reforms, as you say, that we shouldn't assume the familiar is necessary or good, or whether they're leading us in a bad path. And also, we'll have some sense of some of the real-world effects of some of these things, right? Absolutely. And let me just say the proof's in the pudding. I mean, however they organize the government, whether they can make the country better is the ultimate test."
YWEFh-74sav,6475,Jack Goldsmith,"That's when the president changed his mind. Wow. And Comey was in that conversation as well. But it was Mueller, in my understanding, that really convinced... And actually Comey was also there telling the president he didn't have full information, he thought he was making a mistake. But, it's important. And these rules are hard to capture, and it's always judgment calls on both sides. But that tension, as you said, is really important. You need to have arguments about these things, at a minimum. This was the national security issues mostly that you guys were talking about sliding over into criminal law, obviously in terms of the surveillance and all. But let's talk a minute about the national security side of things and you worked in the Defense Department and you've always been interested, I think, and you stayed abreast of those kinds of debates too. So, I mean you hear on the one hand, it's a massive bureaucracy. They're pretty good at handling political... They're pretty good at finding ways around political interventions, excessive political interventions, I'd say. The military's pretty big norms there of not politicizing too much and so forth. On the other hand, they've talked about having an outside review panel for three and four-star generals and so forth. You want civilian control in the military, but on the other hand you don't..."
c254l0TAQuV,4897,Tom Tugendhat,"Now, at the very least, the very least, that's a hell of a warning, that's a hell of a tripwire, right? I mean, if you're setting up claymores to guard your perimeter, you've pushed your perimeter out a hell of a long way. But actually, it does more than that, because actually, it deepens the economic strength of your country. It means that you're better able to defend yourself, and... You know? I don't think that free trade is an act of generosity. I think it's an act of selfishness, actually. By building up liberty, it's a bit like building up public health. You know, you don't want people dying of pandemics on your border. It's just bad for you, you know? It's really bad for you. And to be a little more forward-leaning perhaps, than you're being, I mean, you don't want to live in a world where even if you could somehow put up fantastic barriers against the pandemics, and just watch people die on your border, that is not attractive. It's not sustainable, ultimately, and it's not worthy, really, so no, I think that you've said this very well, though. So let's come back, maybe, to Ukraine, and the situation short-term, but that was, I think a very helpful, though, digression on what [inaudible] on- All right, yeah. ...how we should think more broadly."
Dv2Xu6J6wCe,14449,Anne Applebaum,"Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined again by Anne Applebaum, the very distinguished author of many important books, articles in The Atlantic you need to be reading. And to keep up with what's going on in Ukraine and Europe and the US and the world. I guess your two most recent books are, the most recent was this year, last past year on Autocracy, Inc . and before that, what? 2020, I think. The Twilight of Democracy . Is that what it was called? That is what it was called, Twilight of Democracy . Two upbeat titles, which unfortunately capture the moment, I'm afraid. So anyway, Anne, thanks so much for joining me today. Happy to join you from Warsaw. Well, okay, you'll have to tell us what's happening in Warsaw. Actually, let's begin with Europe. It's the anniversary, obviously, the third anniversary of the all-out invasion of Ukraine, and we want to talk about that some and you've been there and you know so much about it. But let's begin with Europe and the German elections right next door, more or less, to Warsaw, yesterday. What does it mean? What does it mean for Germany? What does it mean for Europe? What conclusions do you draw? So there are a couple interesting things about the German elections."
XbsMTvW4WT4,8353,A.B. Stoddard,"She'll make her up her own mind and she's got all a million considerations obviously, but are you rooting for her to run or think that would be crazy and imprudent and she should do other things? When we talked about this last year, I was so hoping that would be a possibility because I think that she would really provide this course correction for the other people most importantly talking about January 6th for the conversation and the debate in the race, even minus Trump, even if he wasn't on the debate stage. I just think the RNC is so compromised that she'll never get on the debate stage. And I think that all the state parties are compromised and they're subsidiaries of Trump and they won't put her on the ballots, and it's just a total wasted exercise. So in a normal world, if we could go back a few years, it would be very healthy for her to be the outlier who was going to try to revive the old party, but right now that's just Asa Hutchinson because he is playing nice and maybe they'll let him stand on the right far right side of the debate stage, but I don't think they'd permit Liz Cheney anywhere near, I think they'd do whatever they could to make it so hard for her."
4g9bZiiRNef,5905,Larry Summers,"So even in terms of its narrow objective of getting interest rates down, public Fed bashing by presidents is a mistake. I think it is worth just remembering, because people can get awfully purist on this subject that a review of dialogues between the Reagan administration and the Fed in the mid-1980s would be troubling to deep advocates of Fed independence. A review of dialogue between Richard Nixon and his Fed Chairman would be beyond sobering for advocates of Fed independence. A review of Lyndon Johnson and William McChesney Martin's discussions at the LBJ ranch would troubling. So I think this can be romanticized in terms of what the history is, but again, there's a very big difference it seems to me, between private dialogue and public dialogue. And I think what the president is doing is undermining the credibility of the Fed. That is de-anchoring inflation expectations, and that is making it harder to have low inflation without recession. And so it is completely counterproductive from his objectives, whatever your exact view is on how monetary policy should be managed tactically. Who the president selects as Jay Powell's successor, who the president ... How that person conducts themselves and demonstrates independence is something that will be very, very important. I do think it's important to note, and I think that a lot of these discussions at this moment as the president says things about Jay Powell, yet miss, is that the Fed is an institution, not a person."
X2TmksNi_vh,7005,AB Stoddard,"He said, oh yeah, we talk about it all the time. People want me to do it. There's lots of different ways. He's open about it. So it has to be a headline, in my opinion. He's not disavowing it. Yeah, that's really great. I mean, I think you're absolutely right. Yeah, I was just struck as a former chief of staff to a vice president, he didn't even have the courtesy or the instinct, I would say, to say, ""Well, of course my vice president is well equipped to succeed me."" And that would be the normal answer, right? And A, he doesn't believe that, I suppose B, he couldn't care less about JD Vance and about what JD Vance feels when he hears Trump. I mean, it's kind of insulting to the vice president when you're in your second term as president and you're saying that, yeah, I think I probably do need to have a third term to keep this country on track or something. But... He, in an interview with Bret Baier weeks and weeks ago, Bret Baier says to Trump, ""So you're going to be moving on in four years and by the midterms, JD Vance is going to be looking for endorsement."" Trump goes, ""Oh no, [inaudible] there are plenty of other good people."" Basically says it doesn't need to be Vance right away, but it's too early to talk about that."
XRlO65i-YpC,8758,Mark Esper,"Yeah, how worried are you about that? I mean, our friend Eric Edelman, I've done several conversations with him, and he made the same point you just did that particularly the... Everyone assumes we should appropriate the money and we should not have political problems with that. But even if we do, it's not as if our defense industrial base is all where it should be in terms of producing what we need to produce. And of course, our allies isn't either. How much of a priority should that be building up a really serious defense industrial base and also technology base that's within the country, or whether we have very sure access to in terms of future challenges? Well, let's go back to the threat first, I don't think a conflict with China is imminent, and it's not necessarily inevitable. But if the trend lines continue, if the Chinese economy continues to suffer, if Xi Jinping thinks that he's losing control of the country, maybe he'll try and do something. Maybe he'll just try to do something with Taiwan because he wants it to be part of his legacy, and we know that he wants to be in the pantheon of great Chinese leaders like Mao. So you have to plan prudently. Now, when you get to our side of things, again, the Pentagon can certainly do more to move quickly, but in this case, I put a lot of it on Congress."
waOlAeqWxdv,7922,A.B. Stoddard,"The Chinese buying property, the Disney corporation, the teacher, the groomer teachers, whatever it is that he's going after. And he's going to have a new bill in the legislature to end this once and for all. He looks miserable. He always looks like he's counting the seconds until he can leave. And, of course, there was that... he took a recent trip overseas, and he was in Japan. He was supposed to look like a statesman on a world stage. And someone just said, ""You're way behind,"" a reporter said, ""You're way behind Trump in the polls."" And this video went around that looked like it was doctored, he looked so almost like he was on a very strong drug. So the guy has not figured out a sense of comfort with himself as a candidate, a sense of confidence. He feels like he should do it, he's being put up to it. He has all the boxes checked. And he also has a really impressive story in addition to his tenure as governor, but he's not feeling it. And so I think that the people around him are really concerned. And I was in touch with, again just in the last week with a DeSantis supporter...fluffer. And they're really trying to, because we're about to be at liftoff, it's likely he's going to be announcing in about 10 days, likely next weekend around May 25th or so."
bzHcyXJ79oz,8126,AB Stoddard,"And that has gone much more smoothly for him, I think, than he thought it would. Yeah. Well, let's talk about that. We've talked about Trump. What about the resistance to Trump? I agree, none of us... I bet you could Google a million articles about a Trump second term and never see the term ""law firms."" That was not on people's radar screen that he's also going to go punish them, try to damage their business, threaten them existentially, the Paul Weiss guy claimed, and also get tens of millions of dollars of pro bono work that's friendly to him. Universities maybe we expected that a little more, I suppose. The businesses, not big tech stuff, we've all just taken that for granted now, but that was a big deal when it happened right after the election and pretty... Zuckerberg, Bezos, pretty striking. I mean, maybe we'll get to the Democratic party itself, the more political side of things in a few minutes, but what have we learned about America in terms of the resistance? Well, yeah, we'll get to Democrats afterwards. I see sort of the population and then the institutions of law, of acting, yeah. That's a good distinction... And they're different. I feel that we've seen with the law firms always and others, a lot of hands in the air saying, we're trying to protect our business."
FdN12izDUVm,3368,Doug Sosnik,"You're seeing as an example now, companies and state governments all across America, that are now waiving the requirement that someone's a college graduate to get a job. Because that's the only way they could in the past figure out if someone's qualified. But being a college graduate has nothing to do with filling these jobs now. So we're transitioning. And so, this has been a 20 year transition due to the economic changes, the technological changes, the demographic changes, all coming together at the same time. But in the wide swath of history, 20 years is nothing. But when you're living in the middle of it, you feel it's like unbelievable chaos. So the point is, we are going to push through this, and we are going to come to the other side. And a lot of it's going to have to do with the baby boomers, and the remnants of the Greatest Generation dying off. And these emerging generations are going to take power, and we're going to change and we're going to get out of this. But we're still going to be in this barrel for several more cycles. And that's what Trump and Biden represents, which is our transitionary figures that as a country, politics are lagging indicators. We will never get to the other side politically until we get to the other side in terms of who we are as a country and what people care about."
mLVNWE-DXZI,8258,James Carville,"That's a big part, and albeit 52%, but we want to think about the 48% sometimes. Yeah. And I was struck, I was recently, I've been quoting your former boss and your friend Bill Clinton, what is it, Americans prefer strong and wrongs- Strong and wrong than weak and right. I- Do you believe that? Is that part of the problem here? I believe it to a point. I don't think they want strong and authoritarian, or strong and wrong or strong and crooked, but I do think his general point is that they prefer decisive people who really... I think that Biden looks weak, maybe he's done everything he can in his dealings with Netanyahu. He just keeps saying, ""No more of this, no more of that,"" and of course you get more of this, you get more of that, and it's a problem. Gaza's completely misunderstood by the press. What else is new? The Harvard poll, if you remember, the two things they cared the least about were Gaza and student loans. I'm not surprised at all, but outside of- This is a poll of young voters, right? Young voters, yes, under 30. They gave them 15 issues and number 14 and number 15 was student loans and Gaza. I forget what order they came in, but there was so few people, it's not even worth worrying about, which of course completely disrupts the view."
CNwga4cpiay,7212,AB Stoddard,"And in the end he wins. You and I talked at length between '17 and '20. It was clear that he was trying to make the case, lay the pretense for the election to be stolen through the post office and other means should he lose. And we were talking at the time about the lack of alarm from people like John Kelly and Jim Mattis and very serious people who'd been around him, some of whom had already left about what a second term would be like. What if he won? What if he beat Biden? What if he left NATO? What else would he do? Because without the pressures of reelection, he had many clear plans in mind and then other ones that we suspected would be incredibly destructive. And that didn't seem to be a conversation that was sort of clouded by Covid and the American people were in a panic. In the end, Biden prevails, Trump says it's stolen, but we knew that a second term of Trump would be drastically different than the first, and then for him to come back, I just knew that if Biden stuck it out and wouldn't leave the race, wouldn't give the voters another viable option soon enough, which of course he did not. And he turned out to be a man of much more hubris than I believed in '21 and '22."
0wMTb-kG-9i,6619,Jack Goldsmith,"The PCLOB has said this, intelligence committees have said this. There are problems with FISA that the Inspector General identified, and there was a debate about Section 702 and how it should be used. This is the broader forms of collection as opposed to the narrow traditional Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants. So again, it needs to be looked at. There may be other reforms that need to be done, but if they're talking about getting rid of FISA, getting rid of 702, I think that's crazy talk, frankly. I don't think they'll be able to do it. I don't think they will want to do it once they get in. Maybe there will be superficial nods in that direction, but based on what I know and everything I've read, it would be catastrophic actually. Interesting. Just one last thing on the national security, which slides into other areas too. I mean, I was a critic of, actually, of Rumsfeld though I had known him before and liked him. He had been White House chief of staff. He had been Sect F before, 25 years before. He had been on various congressional and other commissions in the 90s on intelligence and I think on defense. Again, what everyone thinks about him, you couldn't say that he... He wasn't a wrecking ball."
kKb589Vc0SX,5438,Tim Snyder,"Okay. I mean, I guess the military situation, there's sort of the objective and the subjective side. I think subjectively, if you're an American, and this right, there are sort of two problems. The first is that the Biden administration, although it generally in my view, has done the right thing and has made a number of adjustments and has been capable of rethinking, in 2022 when things were really critical and sensitive and when the tide of work could have been turned, we spent too much time making decisions and our decisions were based too often on what we thought wouldn't make Putin nervous or they were based on virtue signaling like is this weapon system the right weapon system at the time? And let's think about how good people will be if we supply it as opposed to what the Ukrainians actually needed to finish the war victoriously. The only way to really think about a war is how do you finish it victoriously? And then where we are now, of course, is that we're not supplying anything. You know, Rheinmetall, one German company, is outproducing us in terms of artillery shells. The North Koreans are outlying the entire West, and we, for our own political reasons, which are unfortunately connected to Russia's political reasons, are at the moment not doing anything at all for Ukraine."
kY8s4dcr7Ql,7087,Robert Kagan,"Hi, I'm Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . Very pleased to be joined again today by Bob Kagan. We had an excellent conversation, maybe even less than a year ago, I think, about his second volume of his work on history of American foreign policy, The Ghost at the Feast , which covers the years 1900 to 1941, which I highly recommend in case people haven't quite gotten around to reading it yet. And now Bob's out with a very topical book, a shorter book. So you need to read that. If you want, you could even read this first before you spend all summer on Ghost at the Feast . And this book is called How Anti-Liberalism is Tearing America Apart Again . And I want talk about the book but talk about things beyond the book, obviously. And Bob, thanks for joining me again. It's a pleasure, Bill. Thanks. So I thought we'd talk a second about anti-liberalism and then about the Again part of the title, which is I think a key to the argument of the book. But you wrote a piece, and let me put the anti- liberalism thing this way: we've spoken, I think quite a lot, about the illiberalism of the current authoritarian movement on the right. You wrote a controversial piece."
YPlHYkfw2Bm,7765,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't see that being a big thing. But I'm just focused on Biden and Trump. And I just have this weird feeling that something will intervene. At least one of them will not be on the ticket. I think there's more drama in store. I think that's a good prediction. And no, I have the exact same totally irrational kind of gut feeling, somehow. Of course, analytically, Trump's the most likely Republican nominee. And Biden's overwhelmingly likely to be the Democratic nominee. And yet somehow, deep down, I can't quite believe we're going to have Biden and Trump a year from now. But that lack of belief is worth nothing. So I don't know. We'll have a long time to accept it. We will. We will have to discuss this, both maybe at the end of this calendar year, or before even Labor Day. Let's see what happens. I mean, even this debt ceiling in the next couple of weeks could be pretty, who knows, right? We would not have predicted two months ago that Biden, and Yellen, and the Democratic White House and Treasury Department look a little bit like they're flailing around. And McCarthy's kind of got his budget through the house and is sitting there saying, hey, we've got to negotiate here. Let's speed up the negotiations."
46ONNFNVPau,7519,Robert Kagan,"So this is the one place where this has been attempted, and I think we have enjoyed a lot of luxury. We've been a very prosperous country, we've been a country at peace. So if ever there was a place where you could have this kind of liberalism work, I think it's fair to say that the United States would be a prime contender for it. But even in the United States, it's a difficult thing to pull off. And I think that we've gotten too complacent that liberalism is just the norm in the United States and that it's here to stay. I'm hopeful that we will continue to be a liberal country, but I do think people are not taking seriously enough the risk that we're facing right now to the founders' liberalism. One aspect of being a liberal country is, Lincoln stresses in the last of his speeches, respect for the rule of law, no mob rule and all that. I do think, I mean your discussion of the '20s, you discuss how much the Klan, for example, there's a kind of political side of it working through elected officials and so forth, and then a kind of extra-legal bludgeoning of people and militia side of it, or whatever you want to call it, I guess vigilante side of it, sort of working in tandem."
9VCu4X5C-sr,7375,A.B. Stoddard,"And that is a good thing. I think that once Kevin McCarthy figured out that it wasn't a wave, and it wasn't a slaughter. And he didn't have enough seats to impeach Joe Biden. I mean, I think with a big margin he would've been under serious pressure to do so. And he basically told them, we only have a few seats and we can't do what you guys have planned. So far the investigations are, I think the Hunter stuff is getting a little serious. There's a report out today that IRS agents looking into this stuff were pulled off there at the request of the Department of Justice. This is I think going to continue to be a serious problem for Joe Biden. And I thought the Republicans were going to sort of come out with it right away, but it looks like they probably look like they want to drag it out closer to the election, which probably makes sense. But they're dribbling out some good headlines, good fundraising stuff. Their investigation into Alvin Bragg and stuff is silly. And again, the voters don't know that. They see on Fox that they're fighting the justice department, and they don't know that Congress can't intervene in a pending investigation, and they can't give the documents. But again, they send in the money, and Jordan gets to go home and thunder and roar."
vkaIbWNRYIQ,5265,Tom Tugendhat,"Forgive me, but I mean, you know- I'm not so confident that we have that base that we quite once had, and people talk our weapons are wonderful, I guess, and they seem to be helping a lot, and it's great that we're sending them over, but I've talked to people here, experts here, you know them too, that are a little worried that we're actually... We don't have the Cold War type, multiple... let alone World War II type, multiple lines of production and so forth. But you'll have production lines that put every other country in the world to shame, frankly, so- And you think they're okay? I mean, they're sufficient? We're not going to be- Look, I'm not going to go into the complexities of the US military-industrial capabilities, but you have the capabilities to maintain the war supplies that Ukraine needs to maintain its liberty, and therefore to guard our borders, so you know, frankly, you matter, and you matter an awful lot. Secondly, I think it's worth thinking about a few other things, right? I mean, a country can't stay at war like this and maintain an economy. I mean, you just can't, right? And so, those countries that aren't able to supply weapons should be thinking very seriously about loan agreements. We paid off our martial debt, I think I'm right in saying, under the Blair administration."
ueAULjztyzZ,5217,Tim Snyder,"And you don't think, okay, well, here I am a conservative. Let me look to the right and just make sure that there's not anything over there dangerous which is going on. And I think that was a bit of a mistake. Another thing I've been thinking about is how, during the Cold War, they were always calling us fascists. Right. And we were always kind of saying, ""They're like Hitler."" We were always using the Munich analogy. And I think that also tamed people's sensibilities a little bit, that if you're constantly being called a fascist, you don't think, oh, well, maybe actually I am or my friend is or we could be. And so we've I think we've missed elements in our history which enabled that sort of thing. And the sad thing is that others haven't. The Russians haven't missed it. They've been trying to cultivate that in us and cultivate that generally. Yeah, that's interesting. This is a whole different discussion we should have some time on that because I think it's very shrewd about the history of American thinking and American foreign policy. There wasn't... the fascist regimes that are out there, or semi-fascist or whatever. Nasty right wing regimes weren't threats in the way the Soviet Union was to anyone else in particular, mostly, I would say in the '70s, '80s, Pinochet, whatever."
6LogpOzA70G,2406,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"There were quarantine rules that they had to follow in the first couple of years. And then two, the border heavily diverted ICE resources away from internal enforcement and towards dealing with more recent arrivals. And so as the border gets quieter, those resources can now be re-diverted back to enforcement. And I think we will likely expect to see internal deportations rise significantly as a result of those two factors. It's still a relatively small percentage of the 11 million number that's being thrown around, but- Yeah. So if Homan wins the internal debate in terms of goal setting, so to speak, for the administration, they could say, look, we're doing what we said we would do, which is all these people were just here under Biden and now they're gone. If Miller, in a way, wins the internal debate in terms of at least rhetoric, it'd be very hard for them to ramp up to anything like those levels. Right? Yeah. And to give some sense of the numbers we're talking about, because it's very easy to throw around these numbers and not process how large this is, the highest number of deportations ever carried out by ICE, you know, internal deportations- deportations of people arrested in the interior by ICE was 238,000 in fiscal year 2009, Obama's first year in office."
lKt_C1VugYj,7437,A.B. Stoddard,"And so I think that the people around him are really concerned. And I was in touch with, again just in the last week with a DeSantis supporter...fluffer. And they're really trying to, because we're about to be at liftoff, it's likely he's going to be announcing in about 10 days, likely next weekend around May 25th or so. And he's gathering people to Florida. And so that's what they're anticipating. And they've been in these kind of emergency meetings. It was very telling that the brain trust invited Jonathan Martin of Politico down to talk to them because they don't speak to the mainstream media ever. But the disappointment and the doubt among the donors was so intense, and people were leaving, that they had to reset before this announcement and try to rebuild some momentum. I guess the best place to be is when everyone has literally no expectation that you can pull this off. But he's been in sort of crash repair mode and trying to convince these people he can do it. But we haven't seen it yet. We just haven't seen Ron DeSantis in an interview. Ron DeSantis doing his job, looking like he knows his why and he knows his how of taking on Donald Trump. And so I think I'll believe it, Bill, when I see it, if he really has what it takes."
hNdjSMaVDFY,4162,David Axelrod,"Well, even, I recoil from, after this last weekend, everybody's hair was on fire because he, except Jon Stewart, he had a great bit on this last night, because some guy had on his bumper somehttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Biden. ...phonied-up artwork of Biden bound in the back of his truck. And there is so much out there, so many people out there saying, ""Don't give Trump a platform, don't let Trump..."" I have the opposite view, which is I think more of Trump is better out there, because I do think people need to be exposed to... He's crazier now than he was in 2016, and even 2020, although it's hard to compete with telling people to drink or inject bleach to fight... But he's kind of scary crazy, and people need to understand the choice. I can't stand this notion that if we censor him, it'll all be okay. That's not the case. And I think he's profited, actually... I was relieved when he got taken off Twitter, because it was a migraine headache every day and it was provocative. But now, he's micro channeling, to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just... All that said, Bill, that's just an aside, I'm just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don't think, at the end of the day, that the campaign should be based on all of that."
h2GauI8b5NB,16375,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, has it gone faster than you expected? More radical in tone and in purpose than you expected? I rather thought he might try to boil the frog slowly, but I think they've gone for the opposite shock and awe strategy. They're doing what I thought they would do and what they said they would do. This is what Project 2025 was. It's what all kinds of people said they wanted. It's what Russell Vought said he wanted. They are seeking to traumatize and terrorize the civil service, and government workers more broadly, which includes the military, in order to create not a civil service of the kind we have now, which is loyal to the Constitution and works for Democratic and Republican presidents and is promoted on the basis of meritocracy, but instead is civil service that is loyal to Trump or to Trump's cult or whatever we're calling it. And that has something... I have seen that happen before. It happened in Poland actually in 2015. I mean, because it's Poland, it was less important and there was less drama and so on. And it's what happened in Hungary over a number of years. It's what happened in Venezuela. It doesn't have to be a right wing process. It's what Hugo Chavez did. He famously fired 19,000 workers at the state oil company and therefore destroyed the state oil company."
dLBd0FBfHJH,3167,David Axelrod,"Right now, I think you're seeing the advantages and disadvantages of incumbency at the same time. Biden's raising a lot of money. The bully pulpit that you and I used to talk about has been sort of fractionated, so it's not what it was. Trump, it's interesting. He's getting the value of incumbency and yet still running as an insurgent. It occurs to me, he's always been, even when he was president, he was an insurgent. That's a comfortable place for him to be, but he's not raising the money. Yeah. Though that will come, I suspect if it's competitive. Well, let's go through what will be incumbency is such an important issue. Let's talk about, so what would you, you've been through it. You've actually run one of these, they call you in it's what, seven months ago? Really? Six months ago until voting begins. Begins in late September. It's not quite as far off as everyone says. Let's just assume you're helping President Biden and not former President Trump, and they call you in and say, ""Okay, what do we need to do? Let's be practical here and forward-looking, I guess, and what do we need to do? Where do we stand? What do we need to do? What's the biggest challenges?"" Then we can go through a whole thing for how do you make a better case for Biden?"
3wK-D-Np9xn,8093,A.B. Stoddard,"But we haven't seen it yet. We just haven't seen Ron DeSantis in an interview. Ron DeSantis doing his job, looking like he knows his why and he knows his how of taking on Donald Trump. And so I think I'll believe it, Bill, when I see it, if he really has what it takes. But so far, you could always look good on paper, but when you get out under the light, it's so tough. No, it's so different. I mean, I do think there's, of course, a very short term price we paid, and you do reset, and you have a little bit of panic and meetings and so forth, and you get a little hit in the media for a few days. But actually, there have been successful presidential campaigns, certainly nomination campaigns that had pretty conspicuously bad starts and needed to reset. Gore in 2000. Kerry actually in 2004. I mean, there's cases where people just... neither won the presidency, but that's sort of different. But Obama was viewed as sort of floundering a little bit in the first few months after he... was he really ready in 2007? So I do think McCain totally crashed and burned in 2007. So in a way, I've always thought resetting is better than not resetting, even if the reset is awkward And I guess the question though is reset to what, right?"
8ZTFQY1gsu5,8033,AB Stoddard,"I expect 5:00 AM raids with 20 cop cars outside the houses of people I won't name. Once they can pull together a ""case"" against them. I think that he relishes that. That's really what drives him the most is using the Justice Department to go after his enemies because of course he believed that the Biden administration weaponized the system against him because he was actually held to account for his crimes to an extent, and then ultimately not because he was spared in time for the election. But what surprises me, Bill, is that the rest of the rule of law has... a lot of judges are stopping a lot of the government efficiency stuff and the Elon rampage in the name of DOGE. But it's up, it's down, it's hard to keep track of. We don't know which ones in the end will be actually blocked in the long term. It's a lot of injunctions, et cetera. But the law firms, the idea that people once had someone who crossed Trump on their staff or still do, and so they have to fold to him and give him millions and millions of dollars in pro bono work, and he's relishing, he's just bragging about how easy it is to bend them and the universities and they're all saying, ""yes sir, what's next?"" That, of course, I didn't expect."
C5Hs9SItIjg,7257,A.B. Stoddard,"It doesn't mean that all the kids my kids' age are going to vote because they're tuned out of politics. They think it's insane, and they prefer not to know anything about it. And they don't follow the news, and they're horrified. And we have a mass of apathy in that generation. And so you can look at what an advantage it is for Democrats when those voters vote for Democrats by 28 points. But again, the only thing that activates them are guns and abortion, in my view, and it doesn't activate enough of them. In fact, fewer of them turned out in 2022 than they did in 2018. So it's really a question of, how many voters can they get off the couch on the Democratic side? And I think it's harder than they think. It's not Biden coming in to rescue, to give us a break from this man who's literally telling Bob Woodward that the virus is dangerous while he's lying to us about it, telling us to drink bleach, all the madness. Lafayette Square on June 1st of 2020. Just one thing after another. We could never catch a breath. We've caught our breath. People have forgotten. So it's a different dynamic, and I think that Democrats just assume that it's the same as 2020."
kWjRo0cYiZW,3704,Doug Sosnik,"I mean, ultimately Trumpism is not, it's not clear that it's a stable movement. It's more of a movement and less of a coalition. So I guess both parties could be... I mean, 2025 could be a very interesting year no matter who wins on both sides. Well look, I think it's going to be a new era no matter what. I think that Trumpism without Trump is not the same as Trumpism with Trump. But I think the basic contours of the Republican Party will be the same with or without Trump, which is working class nationalist, we consider it more xenophobic. So, you think they don't go back? I don't think they go back. I'm not that way. But some of my Republican friends who still want to hang on to hope, that's not coming back. So let me address what you just said in two things. First of all, there's been in this eight year period, kind of an unspoken bargain. Which is, the left gets to drive the policy direction of the Democratic Party, but the Democrats get to nominate moderate candidates. And if you look at the impact of Bernie Sanders on the 2016 election, and the change of policy positions that Hillary took to get nominated, you look at Biden's 2020 primary, you look at positions he took as President of the United States."
EW1WEy_XlEB,5529,Larry Summers,"Because when that happens, that's a sign that people just don't trust you and they've stopped trusting you. And so, you make inferences not just from what's happening in markets to which way an individual security is moving, but from a correlation pattern across markets. Typically, it's been the developing country market pattern that's characterized the Argentinas of this world. And it's been the bastion pattern that has characterized the United States. We've had a few moments when it's been otherwise during the Carter administration, right before Paul Volcker was appointed, for example. But the general pattern has been the one I described. What we have seen take hold in the last month is the salience of the American capital flight trade. Days when the stock market goes down, the bond market goes down, the dollar goes down and gold goes up. And that is a sign that the issue is becoming, in a meta sense, confidence in the United States. And when people are going in and out of being confident in you, that is an alarming thing and that is what we've seen emerge. It's the kind of thing that in a developing country, you ask yourself whether they're going to have to have an IMF program within a few months when you start to see that pattern develop."
izTeniFDV9c,6822,Tom Tugendhat,"So let's come back, maybe, to Ukraine, and the situation short-term, but that was, I think a very helpful, though, digression on what [inaudible] on- All right, yeah. ...how we should think more broadly. Because I really do think... I mean, some of us have tried to articulate it a little bit, in articles and so forth, and perhaps just conversations, but no one politician here is really... If John McCain were still alive, honestly I think he would be saying what you're saying, and trying to say that- He's [inaudible] That's good, and trying to say it in speeches, and a more formal way, to really get the doctrines out there. I'm sure you can pick up his mantle. But more concretely, what should we look for the next three, six months? What worries you the most? If you saw something you would say, ""Oh my god, we really need to... We're not doing what we should be doing,"" what are the opportunities perhaps? Just give us the short-, medium-term prospect. The reality is that the only country with the industrial base capable of sustaining this level of weapons consumption is the United States, so we need to make sure... Forgive me, but I mean, you know- I'm not so confident that we have that base that we quite once had, and people talk our weapons are wonderful, I guess, and they seem to be helping a lot, and it's great that we're sending them over, but I've talked to people here, experts here, you know them too, that are a little worried that we're actually..."
0SoAGtPJI0U,7276,A.B. Stoddard,"But Ron DeSantis is all in on culture wars, and he obviously has a solid resume of accomplishments he could be running on. I mean, he does, but he also just wants to be sort of second MAGA king in line, and he has the most appeal. So the others have to test the theory that the Republican primary electorate wants to move past the culture wars. And I don't think they do. And that's why it seems that Ron DeSantis would be the only fallback for the base. It is striking, you'd think there'd be a lane... I mean, once they sort out who's the third man or woman in this race, there's some lane for a non-culture war, somewhat more attractive to independents, perhaps Republican. But I guess that lane is probably 20% of the Republican electorate, not 40, right? And so it doesn't actually win. So maybe DeSantis was right to sort of show he's a culture warrior, even though, from my point of view, it's a little crazy-if you're a pretty successful governor of a major state who won reelection by 19 points-never to talk about that. Almost never to talk about that. And to talk entirely about Disney and so forth, but we'll talk about DeSantis, I guess, and sort of what you've learned about him as a presidential candidate so far."
26hnd2UiLwQ,6660,AB Stoddard,"They don't like that. They don't like tariffs. They don't like, they're really focused on prices and essential services, but they're not focused, in my view yet, on the attack on our freedoms. And so they are not focused on free speech violations. They're not focused on due process violations, on what, not only the deportations to Venezuelans to El Salvador mean, but what it means when somebody is snatched, nonviolent, non-criminal and just sent to Louisiana without due process. I don't see a popular reaction and a voter reaction to that yet. So that, of course, my conversations are anecdotal. His polling is down to 42 in some surveys, but I don't know that there's such a backlash to that yet. Wisconsin judicial race could look like the exception. We could see more of that- voters reacting in these special elections and really turning out because of energized by fury. But I'm not really seeing a mass reaction to the totality of it, and I think that's worrisome. Yeah, we're speaking, just to be clear, Wednesday, April 2nd, the day after the Wisconsin race, we're speaking a few hours before Trump's... ""Liberation Day."" ...tariffs announcement, we'll get to it in a second. But yeah, I do think it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing. I mean, the law firms collapse because they see Trump still at 45, 46% maybe in some of these polls, and they think he's got Republican Congress."
H2Q8b5Jvzyh,9491,James Carville,"Intelligent people who follow politics, which is they sort of think, ""Well, you're losing this county so you got to focus on the other counties."" But of course, a vote you pick up in a statewide, this isn't true of congressional districts, but in a statewide race, losing... If you had two counties the same size, let's just do it like that to make it easy. Picking up a point in the county you're losing 66/34 counts exactly the same as picking up a point in the county you're winning 80/20, right? I mean, you know- It actually is more, I'll tell you. So, I'll go through the thinking, but you're dead on, spot on. What we would do is we were very much into finding videos of Trump. We wanted to be the John Stewart video vault archive, and what we realized is that it really didn't matter that much. So, then we sat down and we would look at Cambria County, Pennsylvania and Hillary lost it, I don't have exact numbers right in front of me. Maybe she lost 78/22. And we said, ""Man, if we could lose this thing 74/26 in Blair County and Luzerne County,"" and you go through the whole laundry list of them, then you would really in effect change sea level. That was our total thinking and that we could get much more bang for..."
3DUpxjcg8PR,3484,Eric Edelman,"But in the UAE in particular, a pretty major concession, I think-and I would like you to explain it more than I can-of a... not relaxation, I think an end, to restrictions. A stopping of restrictions that had been put on on the transfer of certain AI technologies, artificial intelligence technologies to the UAE that had been done by the Biden administration, prodded by bipartisan majorities in Congress. I think some of the leaders of the prodding were Republicans who were worried about this sensitive technology going to the UAE, not a place that's known for not letting the technology escape elsewhere. And in particular, a place that has very close relations with China. And I gathered-I knew nothing about this, but you do learn, sure, sure, on these matters-that the UAE has a lot of facial recognition technology to keep everyone under control that's provided by China. So all this talk about, ""very tough on China,"" and then it turns out to get the business deals for the Trump family and/or for the US, or other US entities, this rather sensitive and important AI technology is going over there to the UAE. I don't even know if there are nominal... I guess there are nominal controls on it, but was that not... Am I overstating that? No, I think that's something that everyone's going to be keeping an eye on as time goes on."
ZWTJW_75poT,2704,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah, so he can legally find ways to make it very difficult for any migrants to be allowed into the United States. But as we saw with Title 42 the first time around, even if you sign an order saying not a single person should be allowed into the United States because of COVID, that doesn't actually mean that not a single person will be able to enter the United States and remain here. Some obstacles remain. First off, it's a 2,000 mile land border. It is extraordinarily difficult to stop everyone from crossing. And administrations have been trying for half a century, with not that much success, to bring numbers down to zero. No one's ever managed to bring numbers down to zero. And then secondly, some diplomatic issues will remain. So a good example is people who come from countries that don't accept deportations. If you cross the border today and you come from, say, China, China has restarted accepting some deportations in recent months, but they're taking about one deportation flight a month, each flight carries about 135 people. So if 5,000 people from China cross the border, it doesn't matter what the policy on the ground actually says. In immigration, presence is nine-tenths of the law. You are now on US soil. If the United States wants to deport you, then it is going to have find a country that is willing to take you."
Qjpwl63MOb3,2439,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So they're here, and some administrations are, so to speak, nicer to them than Trump threatens to be. I suppose the question is, will Trump find that ultimately in his political interest to kind of go after people who are graduating from high school and applying to college or working in an undocumented way in building trades or hospitality or something like that, or leave that alone and focus more of the ones who have caused more of a ruckus, more politically been the object of a ruckus maybe politically, the last year or two or three, who are the more recent undocumented arrivals? Yes. So ironically, it's actually going to be very hard for them to focus on the more recent arrivals, because the overwhelming majority of the more recent arrivals are already in the process of being ordered potentially deported. There are 3.7 million cases currently pending in immigration court. These are people who already have been arrested, have already been placed into a deportation process, and that is the vast majority of recent arrivals. Now, it's true that there are some recent arrivals who missed a court hearing and have already been deported and who they could attempt to focus on. But most of the recent arrivals aren't people who are needing to be newly arrested by ICE."
b2gseAgkUIH,9195,A.B. Stoddard,"So that's what I was expecting. I was expecting a big Republican margin that was going to buffer them, and let the crazies rule. So it's a challenge for the Democrats to respond to that, and they need to get their head around the fact that McCarthy has landed in a good spot right now. At least tactically. No, that's such an important point. And we'll close with that. I do feel like the Democrats haven't done a very good job of taking all these mini-scandals and embarrassments, George Santos and stuff, they haven't really wrapped it around the Republican's neck. So it's sort of well, Santos is a bizarre story, and here's the latest detail of that. But no one thinks, I don't know, that somehow, shouldn't the speaker do something about that? Or shouldn't his colleagues do something? And that's been true of Gosar and others. And so the Democrats are not very good at sort of attaching the worst things any one Republican member does to the whole conference. And McCarthy has done a decent job of getting Marjorie Taylor Green and Gaetz and all to speak up less. I guess maybe the speaker vote thing, which was sort of an short-term embarrassment to McCarthy was kind of also a wake-up call for all the others that we can't go through, it would hurt them all if everything just broke."
CiTNkLEtW6x,6842,Tom Tugendhat,"I don't think anybody's saying that now about any country. The reality is that state on state warfare, I'm afraid, sadly is a reality again, and I think that's a big change because I think it's a huge wake up moment for even those who thought that we should be doing deals with dictators in various different ways are now realizing that actually, that may be harder than they thought. It's been a while now that some of us have been calling out the fact that you can't feed the crocodile, the crocodile gets hungrier with the eating. And the reality is, that's what Putin has done over the last 20 years. That's what Xi would do. That's what plenty of other dictators around the world would do. Yeah, the other crocodiles also see the success of one crocodile and that has its own implications. You mentioned the UK's leadership and Australia and others. One, I'm just curious as a somewhat more, not a technical question really, but I'm struck that on the one hand, this is a success story for NATO, I think you'd have to say, that's come together quite well and admitted to new members that will be excellent contributors, I think. But it feels to me, and I talked to someone from one of the countries who said, this there's a huge amount of coordination going on, but a lot of it's going on in informal groupings or sub..."
IhvdFaux86F,5632,Tim Snyder,"And then just as a footnote, it helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don't get. And I think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time around. But they don't have any hesitation about seeing things about us that we might hesitate to see. And so they understand that our isolationism has to do with racism, and they feed that. They feed that constantly. So I see them as kind of a bad doctor. They're a doctor who wants you to die, but nevertheless their diagnostic skills are not so bad. They can figure out what's wrong with you, and then they try to make it worse, right? Yeah, well- But they see that the racism and the isolationism are the same thing. And I think that's a point we should probably also be taking. Yeah. No, that's important. Yeah. Well, good poisoners know the same things as good doctors. I think it goes back to Plato and stuff. Just one last... I want to get to action, what's likely to happen on the ground and in Russia and Ukraine and so forth in a second. But one last minor semi-political theory point, almost going back to my studies many years ago, but people my age, and I certainly was so influenced by Hannah Arendt and The Origins of Totalitarianism and the whole left-right horseshoe, they're both totalitarians, and so much in common."
ShoILxypj6B,13851,Anne Applebaum,"Certainly in Western Europe. They didn't have issues like France did. They weren't... Germany was complicated, unification and some trade economic rivalry. The Danes were happy. They were sort of unambiguously pro-American was my general feeling. Partly they probably wanted a little bit of barrier, bulwark against Germany. But anyway, yes, to lose that over. Yeah. But as you say, that's only the tip of the iceberg, I guess, in Denmark. Well, let's talk about the US since we've sort of talked about it indirectly through the European lens, which is a real lens though, and a very concerned and perceptive lens, I would say. But I mean, you've written so much about autocracy so well, you saw it coming. You were right, I think in seeing so many that it would be more serious than a lot of people thought. Is even you... Are even you-what's the right way to say that grammatically? -surprised though, by the pace of it and the speed of the authoritarianism and the fact that it seems to be, to me at least, to be accelerating? There's certain wishful thinking here after three months, four months, Elon Musk goes away, DOGE, okay, we've seen the worst of it. It's going to slow down sort of reversion to the mean. It wasn't crazy to hope that, I suppose, but it feels to me like it's more like the opposite."
CGqfQaIabdq,2552,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"We can say it's probably unlikely-almost impossible-that 11 million are deported. But given this new world we are in right now, and with the possibility of this massive influx of funding, saying how much they're going to get and how quickly they can ramp up this enforcement, it's still tricky. I suppose you mentioned earlier the Trump effect in 2017, at the border people just thought, maybe I shouldn't come, I can't get in. I suppose there could be some self-deportation and fear certainly among immigrant communities that can make their lives pretty miserable, honestly, in an unfortunate way for people who've been working hard and kids graduate from high school and suddenly they're worried. But it could also lead some people to go back, I suppose. I guess, how much will things be different 6, 9, 12 months from now? Leaving aside almost the politics for a second now, though that's an important part of what Trump wants to say and boast about. I mean, I suppose there could be some changes in numbers, right? Yeah. And self-deportation is the big question mark. What percent of people do see these mass enforcement operations carried out and the enforcement ramping up and say, ""You know what? I don't want to deal with this. I'm just going to go back to my home country.""?"
j-mZzWOZDC3,6285,Jack Goldsmith,"We had 50, 55 proposals and almost all of them got basically nowhere. As soon as Trump left office, nobody seemed to care anymore, including the Biden White House, to my disappointment to kind of doing what I thought it would take to put the presidency on a sounder footing. Yeah, it was disappointing how... I read the book and did a little bit to try to promote some of it, and yeah, people lost their sense of urgency and alarm, I guess, once Trump had left office. I guess the one thing that happened that you, I think, called for and were pretty sympathetic to, was the Electoral Count Act. I mean, reforming somewhat the procedures on January 6th. That was very important. Bob and I were involved in that. At the margins, I don't want to take credit for it, but it was a very important reform, and it was an astonishing, really, that it was able to happen. It had bipartisan support. The worry was that it would take on the patina of an anti-Trump reform, which it could have, but it didn't, and there was just a really bipartisan consensus that the old-hundred and fifty-year-old-rules governing how basically the accounting of electors works and all the rules around that should work and clarifying the role of the vice president and the like."
SVr1zJKUrdo,8521,Mark Esper,"Yeah, I think we could really use a greater sense of urgency in Washington about these matters, again, within the Pentagon and certainly on Capitol Hill. I mean, look, Congress has been dithering for months now with regard to this latest spending package for Ukraine, which also includes, by the way, Israel, Taiwan, et cetera. So there's that. I think we should up our game there, but more puzzlingly is Europe. I mean, they have Russia invading a neighboring country right on their doorstep. And if you look at all, now 32 allies, some are really doing a great job, they've increased their defense spending significantly. Poland, for example, is above 4%. You have some of the Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, who have high levels of defense spending and who are contributing as a percent of GDP more than the United States is to the Ukrainian war effort. But then you look at other parts of the alliance, those countries that are further away from Russia, and you just see no change. I mean, even Canada is still spending 1.2% of its GDP on defense. I mean everybody in the alliance, but particularly the European countries who are nearby, you would think they would be far more alarmed and increasing rapidly their defense budgets to really meet the threat."
z1yvx-nJ0EP,8298,James Carville,"And the extremism MAGA message worked. We didn't really talk about Trump much in those races, and Shapiro won by [inaudible] and Shapiro didn't and Whitmer didn't and they won by 15 and 10 points in swing states. I feel like there's more to be developed there. And the Trump stuff almost swamps everything else, and people forget how actually extreme some of these policies are. By the way, Shapiro, I might have more admiration and respect for him than any politician in America. What they did was just really smart politics of getting Mastriano and kind of helping him be the nominee, and you can talk about Nick Fuentes. Why not? He had dinner with Nick Fuentes. And what cracks me up if some... 20% of what I'd call, quote, ""pro-Israel"" unquote, community likes Trump. Okay, well, you like Nick Fuentes. How about a Hamas leader in Moscow meeting with Putin? Well, you're not that bothered about Ukraine, but you can't stand Hamas. Well, guess who Hamas is buttering up to? None other Vladimir Putin. We need to be a little clear in delineating our enemies here. But there's also a limit to what the president and his campaign can achieve. If you had a candidate of George W. Bush, I believe Obama or Clinton, most candidates, they could go out and execute."
rQshY-kiK5K,8024,A.B. Stoddard,"And, meanwhile, DeSantis is talking about Disney. I really think Trump is in a better demagogic lane than DeSantis as of now. So anyway, comment on all that. I do agree, talking about inflation and not starting World War III is enough of a message alone. It's actually true. And you can say the border's chaotic, which actually, interestingly enough, this week it turns out that it's sort of not after the end of Title 42, but that could change. It will be at some point. Right. And so if he sticks to a simple message that's not all about what he calls ""gender insanity."" A few months ago, he was so worried about Ron DeSantis, he was trying to run to the right on him on education. He seems so confident now he's not doing that anymore, but if he will- There's been a mention of some, which is good for his days, probably. Yeah. But putting out the scary videos and stuff, he feels like now he should retreat to that and speak to the general electorate. In the CNN in town hall, he was having an absolute blast because he's a showman, and as Mike Murphy tweeted, ""It was open mic night for him."" So once he realized they were laughing and applauding, he called everybody stupid."
TPm-3nQtMvZ,7516,Robert Kagan,"And so you have to ask, how sincere is that belief and how much is it that they're just cool with Trump? I just think we have to face that possibility. I mean, the in-between stage, and I guess students of the psychology of authoritarianism and stuff and authoritarian movements have really studied this a lot, is a kind of wishful thinking where you don't quite have to... I mean, you're saying they have to face it. They don't quite have to face it because people can deceive themselves about a lot of things, and so they should. But yeah, they can tell themselves guardrails will hold a little more than you... It's not just 20, 80%, maybe it's 95% and Biden's worse than you say. And the combination of those things lets me go down this path. But I agree, it's required much, much more. This is what's most striking for me over the last three years, I think, is what you're saying. It's required so much more willful blindness than it did in 2016 or '17. God knows we were anti-Trump in 2016. You were extremely outspoken and vocal and analyzed it, but you could talk yourself into things then that you really shouldn't be able to now. But people literally, as many people are talking themselves into it now."
LGN1WUkW6uE,5994,Aaron Friedberg,"The tensions, obviously, between the United States and China continue. China continues to apply pressure to Taiwan. They've been doing things to put more pressure on the Philippines. And I think more concerning, perhaps more important is the pace of the Chinese buildup of its military capabilities across the board, including, now, a large nuclear buildup. So that one, maybe, is burning at a lower flame for the moment. But it's obviously, or in my view, it's the biggest long-term threat and problem. But the Chinese haven't, thus far, been eager to push it beyond where it is now. They seem pretty content to keep things at, again, a certain low boil, continue to develop their capabilities. Say a word about the relationship of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea. You've stressed this in past conversations, the- Yes. Yeah. That, I think, when we spoke last, and I think maybe even in a prior conversation at the time, I was thinking about a piece I had written about, not a stunningly original notion, but that there was an axis of authoritarians that had emerged and seemed to be operating in closer and closer alignment. And the question from my side was, to what extent are we going to succeed in building a functioning coalition of democracies, global coalition, that would include our allies in Europe and in Asia cooperating with us and working together jointly to deal with this growing threat, which is emerging from the center of Eurasia, if you like, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea."
mxMoS0phwPG,9303,James Carville,"But go ahead. Next you go, Brett."" Okay, there's all kinds of... You have a lot in your tool kit. And then he... Now he's caught in a vice because he said he would do it on Fox. She said fine. She made the date specific. And I think that's the kind of infighting that you got to do. And I think it'd be pretty effective. Yeah, that sounds interesting. And then they end up debating, you think? Eh...You know I'm not very good... It is going to be a lot of heat. It's going to give her... Giving your opponent an answer to everything. ""Well, why didn't he say it to my face?"" And she said that at first. That's something that we used in... ""Hey, if you got something to say about me, you son of a bitch, say it to my face."" You've heard that growing up. I mean that's as common as anything. It's particularly common in middle America. So as long as he does not debate her, she has a classic answer to anything that's thrown at her. And he's instinctive enough to realize this. He's got a lot to risk either way. I would much rather be her than him. And of course, she also has another kind of built in advantage. She'd kind of be judged against Biden's June the 27th performance, which is..."
YwvWBZ4uYAn,3447,Doug Sosnik,"Yeah. Yeah. And the third party candidacies historically that had an impact were kind of like movement candidacies. Wallace in '68, which is the last time a third party candidate carried states, I mean, regardless of what you thought of his politics, he had clear politics. And if you look at the McCarthy in the '68 primary, you look at Perot in '92, I mean, he actually stood for something. So it's easier said than done when you get real about who is a third party candidate going to be, and who's the vice president, but I don't think it's going to be enough to just say, ""I'm not the other guys."" Yeah, that's interesting. But the pushing back of the calendar on the back end does make that Democratic Convention weirdly important, perhaps. I mean, those of us who've been intrigued by the notion of Biden stepping aside have also been intrigued by the notion of the excitement of the open write-ins in the primaries, and a lot of uncommitted delegates, and an open convention, and everyone I know is like- Well, the problem is... I think it's true for Republicans, I know it's true for Democrats, which the last time that the convention served that purpose of nominating someone based on who's on the convention floor was '68."
Ii18O_s53CU,8121,Robert Kagan,"That was a real step back, toward a more white- centric... in a sense, it was a period of whites trying to reclaim what they were losing. And it had been going- After a large period of big immigration and progressivism being the dominant ideology, in a way in both parties, right? Right. So it is in that way it's a little like 2016. There were, you might say, modern Republicans and modern Democrats, and there was reaction against both. Trump ran as much against Republicans as against Democrats. And I suppose the same you could say about the 1920s. Well, there is this, except that in the 1920s, I think that the anti-liberal forces basically won, and they did control the presidency in that period. So first you have this massive wave of immigration and the pressure to shut the door on immigration, which is, by the way, bringing in all kinds of southeastern Europeans and Jews and what have you, which are striking most Americans as very odd and different kind of people. That was not making them happy. But this is massive influx of immigration from the late 19th century into the early 20th century. And the pressure to cut that off begins pretty early. Wilson has to fend off numerous efforts by Congress to cut off immigration, but ultimately the success comes in the 1920s."
L2rmVZs198U,7741,AB Stoddard,"I do think still for everything that we've had now for the first two and a half months of the Trump administration, Trump's second term, people are not facing what's happened so far and what's likely to happen. There's a lot of sense-I'll just close by asking you to react to this-a lot of sense of, oh, that's really been crazy, but now it's going to subside and it's going to kind of be normal. But I feel like it's just as likely that we've seen two and a half months of movement from here to here, and the next two and a half months is going to be from here to here, right? I mean, it's not as if, especially if he's succeeding in some of these things, why would they stop now, so to speak? The authoritarians want to keep going. Yeah, that's the problem. I do find among my friends and peers and family, people who are not following this closely, they believe that there's this a hundred day sprint and then it will end. And that I think that they believe there's some guardrails that are going to magically appear like airbags in a car accident. And Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, will have a conversation with a very high-ranking person, the CIA, and all this nonsense will be stopped."
DPjfv580YAp,3195,Eric Edelman,"So yes, I find the international environment very worrisome. We will be worried, but more importantly, we'll try to intelligently discuss it and do what we can, I suppose, to influence it. So Eric, thank you so much for sharing your genuine wisdom here with us today, and we'll have you back soon, obviously. Look forward to it. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
j-MdRm4pi1L,14973,Anne Applebaum,"We're a lucky country. You and I belong to a lucky generation. Yes, I agree. We lived in an era when it felt like democracy was flourishing and spreading. We got used to that idea. Our country became more democratic in our lifetimes. It became more fair, certainly since I was born in the 1960s. I mean since then, the country, in many ways, has transformed. And so, we got used to the idea that it would always be like that. And it's really important that people understand that we've hit a big turning point. I mean that Americans come to the realization that the Europeans have, which is that this is very different, it's very new and it requires new ways of thinking. Well, that's a good, I think, important note to end on and a good challenge to us to think. I view it very much as that cliche that wonderful line of Lincoln's in his first message to Congress, I think, at the end of 1861, ""We have to think anew because conditions are anew,"" whatever. It's much more eloquent than I just said it. And he meant it, I think. And he did a lot of things that really... We think of him as preserving the Union and the constitution, which is true, but also huge amount, of course, leaving aside the Emancipation Proclamation and winning the war."
bT2OkemPGe1,2487,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Migrants are essentially trapped in southern Mexico. Any migrant who's caught outside of the state of Chiapas is arrested, rounded up, and sent back to Chiapas in southern Mexico. So you have migrants traveling north, being arrested and found at a checkpoint, sent south. They try again, they get arrested again, they get sent south. They try again, this goes on over and over again. The number of people actually making it to Mexico's northern border with the United States is really lower than it has been in years. What does Trump propose to do on the border? Yeah, so we are hearing that there are about four or five different things that the Trump administration is going to propose and either implement on the first day or at least announce a plan to implement. First off, he has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he's going to end the Biden administration's practice of expanding access to the asylum process at ports of entry and close the CBP One app by which people enter essentially a lottery system to get an appointment to enter the US and get one year of humanitarian parole after which they're placed into immigration court where they can apply for asylum. We also know- Just to get clear, so if you show up legally at a port of entry and say, ""I want asylum,"" you fill out documents and so forth, and then you're okay for a year in the US until a trial or until appointment with an administrative judge or something like that?"
lPyVJBiT4tW,7835,James Carville,"None. And from that, he's learned, I can do what I want. I can back out of a debate. What are they going to do to me? I mean, do you think though that Biden literally every day for the next month just says, in the course of discussing whatever issue he's discussing, ""I very much look forward to debating Donald Trump on this. I'm going to explain why my policies are better than his."" I mean, it would make it a little hard. You could do a little... make them pay a little bit of a price maybe. I don't know. Maybe not. He seems to be good at avoiding paying prices. I think that's a good idea: ""That's something I want to discuss on June 27th, in the presence of Donald Trump."" And I think it's much more effective. ""But as you know, Jennifer, we're very committed to blah, blah, blah."" I actually, I think definitely it's a good idea at every point. And we're glad that people talk about this economy, that economy. We'd obviously be glad to discuss that up and coming debate with Donald Trump, June 27th, CNN. Be there, be square. We're looking forward to it and we're looking forward to having another big debate so people can see where we are in this thing."
h8T-X_kQZLb,3920,David Axelrod,"Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months. This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these... These are strategies. This isn't just expressions of outrage on his part, they're strategies, and we need to call them out for what they are. Well, yeah, I've very much thought that, therefore, I don't really like the, ""He's popping off again, it's all instinct with him and anger."" And there's, of course, a lot of that, God knows, but yeah, there are these branding strategies, he's been doing that for 50 years, marketing- Yes. ...and he's unfortunately good at it. I said to someone the other day, I was critical of the Biden campaign, but I was sympathetic, I said, ""It's tough to run against Trump, he's a tough opponent. He's, in his own crazy way, a very skilled politician of a certain type."" And the person looked at me like I was just crazy. ""Trump is not skilled at anything. Trump is a lunatic. Trump is crazy. He can't control himself. He says one stupid thing after another."" But I think that's a mistake among Liberals and Democrats."
GuA2Ll9ZMDa,15426,Anne Applebaum,"And I hope there are secret negotiations that I don't know about where something better is happening. But what we see from the outside, and indeed what the Europeans and the Ukrainians see, is simply President Putin stringing along Donald Trump. There clearly have been some business deals discussed, offering him the impression of change and movement, but without making any real offer towards peace. So the Russians have never said they want to end the war. They have never recognized the sovereignty of Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, a few days ago said it's not even clear that they recognize President Zelensky as the president of Ukraine. They have never stopped fighting, they have never stopped hitting civilian targets. So all I can say is they haven't made any shift. And at the same time, we are watching the US take apart its own strategy towards Russia that's been built up actually over a couple of decades. So the US is undermining or seeking to defund Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, this is the Russian language and other language broadcasters that broadcast in that part of the world. We've removed funding from other independent Russian media. These are organizations that can bring the truth about the war to Russia, which also has an impact on how people feel and how the war is perceived there."
FtfA0gfBTOL,5985,Invisible Rulers,"And it was just watching these... It's not like a top-down, coordinated thing. It's a bottom up, organic, improvisational process. And I think that people who are institutionalists and are inherently... And I am one, we need institutions for society. But you also have to understand that this dynamic, it's much more of an insurgent type of dynamic than a controlled brigade force, if you will. And harnessing that force in support of institutions, is maybe a little bit more challenging because so much of it is priding itself on this idea that, ""we are the media, we're in control, we're leading."" And that's why it does have this sort of inherently anti-authority, anti-expertise sentiment that lends itself particularly to sort of populist messaging and values. I think that last point's so important. Yeah, that was really my next question, but I'll ask you to follow up a little more on that even. Because it does seem, okay, you can get this, so let's call it organic conspiracy theorizing. Certainly that has existed over the centuries. And in the age of the internet, they can find each other more. It can be intensified by the algorithm. It can find villains to attack. You add to that though, people who are purposely powerful people or powerful governments, purposely using that for political purposes, political in a broad sense as well as actual elections."
aMFeEYSmbRb,3098,Eric Edelman,"And not only that, it allowed them to experiment with more advanced centrifuges that could enrich uranium at a faster rate and at a larger scale that would enable it to, on very short notice, amass enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. And for Israel, this is a potentially existential threat. For us, it's an inconvenience and bad for proliferation, but for Israel it's existential. Late former Iranian president, Hashemi Rafsanjani famously said, ""Israel is a one-bomb country,"" because it's so small and the population is so concentrated that it only takes a very small number of nuclear weapons. You don't need an arsenal the size of the US or Soviet Union or Russia or China even to be able to accomplish Iranian aims. So Bibi I think is facing a very difficult political calculus here. On the one hand, you have the sort of context that we've just been discussing, which is a little bit uncomfortable relationship because although folks anticipated that Trump would be more pro-Israel than Biden and Harris, I think what they did not properly anticipate is that Trump still harbors, I think, a lot of animus towards Bibi for Bibi's recognition of Biden's election in December of 2020. Second, Bibi seems to be trying Trump's patience in Gaza. You mentioned the cancellation of the Vance visit, some of that has to do with not wanting to give the appearance of having given the green light to Bibi for his announced reoccupation of Gaza and the military activity that is accompanying it."
Wub18Me25oF,5745,Tom Tugendhat,"And I named them both in parliament as people we should consider sanctioning on the grounds that they are enabling the erosion of freedom in Europe. And in fact, personally, I'd describe them both as traitors to themselves and to their countries. It was very interesting that very quickly François Fillon dropped his connection to the various Russian companies. But I think we should be looking at our own people, not just at Russian corruption, as in oligarchs, but we should be looking to our own people too and seeing who's frankly betraying the United States, who's betraying the United Kingdom, who's betraying France, Germany, whoever else by enabling this erosion of democracies, this erosion of freedom and this violent war of aggression against the Ukrainian people. Of course, there's a middle ground between betrayal, which is awful and staunch willingness to stand up and take some pain, so to speak, economically and in other ways to help the Ukrainians fight back. And where do you think the big countries in Europe, Germany is obviously crucial in this and has gotten the most attention, are on this? Are you reasonably confident about the next three, six months in terms of the NATO countries holding together in a reasonably strong posture? Yeah, I am. Look, I mean, forgive me, but the UK has quite clearly been in the lead on this."
ql4xGWVDzvd,6966,Invisible Rulers,"And instead, what happened, unfortunately, is that... Speaking of Wall Street sayings, there's that Charlie Munger one, ""Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes."" And that's where you see, again, the incentives of social media unfortunately start to turn to all of these influencers who maybe start out as just sort of plucky people wanting to tell their vision of the truth to the world, eventually begin to... A lot of them begin to monetize, to sell a particular vision of reality to an audience, they wind up in this audience capture kind of process, and they begin to really reinforce kind of selling a particular message to a particular niche. And through the sort of process of curation, where an algorithm filters you in particular directions, you do start to see this reinforcement. And so the way I describe it in the book is, instead of this hegemonic propaganda that sells a vision of America to the entirety of America, you wind up with these people who are sort of selling a vision of a particular identity to a particular niche. And so you have these fragments that fight with each other instead of a more unified form of propaganda. I don't know which is worse. I kind of go back and forth on that, but that's the..."
e1XKuICx8Fx,2386,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And then you also ask every person who looks vaguely undocumented, which means every Latino standing around them, and you question them, you ask that person for their papers. And if they're undocumented too, you pick them up also. And I think we're going to see a lot more arrests like that under the Trump administration. That's what they did the first time around, and it actually leads to more arrests of people with no criminal records. Because even if you're focusing on targeting criminals, if you're also rounding up everyone around that person with a record who just happens to be undocumented, you're going to sweep up a much larger number of people. But again, we've already seen the incoming administration start to temper expectations. Reporting from over the weekend suggested that the Trump campaign, the transition team, is telling people, ""We will not get 11 million in four years. Maybe we'll do one to two million."" Now, even that is a pretty high bar to set if you add up every single internal deportation. So the deportation of people picked up by ICE in the interior of the country, not migrants arrested at the border, over the last 15 years, it adds up to about 1.5 million deportations. So they're trying to say that they'll carry out 15 years of deportations in 4 years."
zN7K7BaVNKU,5855,Tom Tugendhat,"That means changing the way that you do supplies, and repairs, and training, and any number of different things to go from an army, to being a sort of best effort engagement, to a sustainable engagement. And that's difficult, right? I mean, that means that I think the next stage that we need to make sure we're helping with is logistics. It's training. It's those elements that turn a quick fighting force into a sustainable army. And that's difficult to do. It's difficult to do because it requires very, very hard decisions and prioritization, that we can't make for them, but President Zelensky has demonstrated huge capability in strategic thinking, so I'm not concerned about that. What we need to be there to do is when people want to be trained, when they're looking for assistance in different ways, we're offering to do it. Now, the United Kingdom is already doing a lot of it in Salisbury, as you may know, on Salisbury Plain, so there's not... We can demonstrate that we can do it, but there are other countries that should be helping too, and I hope they'll step up. And so when you mentioned President Zelensky again, I feel like he got a huge amount of attention, deservedly, in the first two or three months, and now it's become sort of more routine, but I feel like people haven't quite appreciated what he did, and maybe I'm..."
FpHltv3Sf0X,2396,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And despite the rhetoric around the undocumented population and the way the Trump campaign talked about it, most of these are people who have been here for a long time. There is a minority that arrived in the last four years. Yes, it is several million people, but the majority of the undocumented population has been here for a long time. According to estimates from the Department of Homeland Security as of 2022, there were 11 million undocumented people in the country. Of that 11 million, 8.6 million had been here before 2009. In fact, according to their estimates here, about 1.46 million undocumented immigrants arrived in the 1980s, 3.36 million in the 1990s, and about 3.86 million during the 2000s. And they are here in large part because of the growth of border security over the last few generations. In the 20th century, migration across the US-Mexico border was mostly circular. People would come here, work for a little while, and then go home. And then if they wanted to then make some more cash, they'd earn some money in the US, come back, live with their family, come back to the US, earn a little bit more, come back, go back to Mexico, like that. But that practice of circular migration is gone. That is essentially eliminated because, over the last 30 years, the United States has built up a massive border security infrastructure and legal infrastructure to make those kinds of acts punishable a lot more harshly, and for actually getting across the border, a lot harder to do."
l6r3Rr-tYVz,16849,Anne Applebaum,"They are moving, but I was told at the current rate, they will take all of Donbas in something like four and a half years. Donbas is a tiny part of, well, it's a large part, but it's still pretty far Eastern Ukraine. So the Ukrainians continue to hold the line. They continue to innovate. They're building new drones. I've just seen some photographs actually of a new type of drone they've built that seems to be modeled on an Israeli model. They're now building their own missiles. I think another piece of the story that's really not understood is the Ukrainian campaign inside Russia against Russian refineries. And just in the last few days, they've hit several very large ones. And these are refineries that affect the internal Russian market. And one of the effects has already been long lines at gas stations all across, particularly, the eastern and southern parts of Russia. So the story that we're usually told, which is Ukraine is about to be crushed by Russia, and that actually President Trump seems to believe, is not true and hasn't been true for, it's not quite three and a half years, but three and a quarter years so far. So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that."
42-41ibOs3O,2301,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah. And self-deportation is the big question mark. What percent of people do see these mass enforcement operations carried out and the enforcement ramping up and say, ""You know what? I don't want to deal with this. I'm just going to go back to my home country.""? And I think the answer is not zero. Certainly, we would expect a significant portion of people in the course of a mass deportation campaign to leave voluntarily. And there is the issue of the fact that there's a lot of these people who entered in the '80s and '90s, some of them are getting onto the age of being senior citizens. A lot of them, they've been working hard manual labor jobs their whole lives. They can't get health insurance. It's very hard for them to support themselves. And if they don't have family here in the US, some of them may simply say, you know what? Enough is enough. I've gotten some savings; I'm going to go home. But it could also go the other way. You also could have these people who say, you know what? I've been here for 30 years. This is my home. I own my house. There's many undocumented homeowners. I've been living here. My family is here, my children are here. Their children may be US citizens, or their spouses may be US citizens."
k3VWvXRZ-XO,3421,Eric Edelman,"Second, Bibi seems to be trying Trump's patience in Gaza. You mentioned the cancellation of the Vance visit, some of that has to do with not wanting to give the appearance of having given the green light to Bibi for his announced reoccupation of Gaza and the military activity that is accompanying it. Apparently, the pressure has been so great from the administration on the Israeli government that Bibi has, for instance, allowed humanitarian assistance to go back in, although he won't allow that to be voted on by his cabinet because he knows it would divide the cabinet because the ultra-right ministers, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir would vote against it. So there's tension in the relationship. He also knows that Trump very much would like to have an agreement on Iran rather than military action. And Trump has made it clear he prefers an agreement to military action. So Bibi at some level has to allow some of this diplomacy to play out, but it can't be very comfortable for him because as you say, he, and I think other Israelis rightly believe that they have a window, that because of what they did last October when they used their F-35s and other systems to essentially knock out Iran's integrated air and missile defense, they have a window for a potential military attack on the Iranian nuclear program."
-5x8i2L2vX3,8168,Robert Kagan,"I think they also think they'll be fine. I no longer believe ... This was a turning point for me, I don't know whether you've gone through this as well. I spent a lot of time, most of the past couple years, thinking people just don't get it. They don't really see what a threat Trump is. They're not seeing it clearly. I no longer believe that. I think everybody sees what Trump is. It's too obvious to miss. And so if you're still voting for him, that means either you like what he's talking about or you don't care. You like that he's going to be a dictator. And he himself has said quite correctly that a lot of his followers are delighted at the prospect of him being a dictator. I think that's true. But what about everybody else? They're okay with it. They're willing to vote for someone who they know could be a dictator. I mean, Bill Barr was the best example of this recently, but he's a professional Republican and those people are just cowards. I mean, people like that are just being cowards. But your average Republican voter, who I think is probably a white... Even a white suburban male in particular does not feel that he's going to really lose out in this other system, whatever it's going to be."
ELJGWgJdh0x,5799,Tim Snyder,"What worries you the most and cheers you up, if anything, the most. Well, let me just pick up where you started then I'll go somewhere else. I mean, the striking thing about us helping the Ukrainians is that we could help... Most of the stuff we're giving Ukraine is stuff we were going to throw away. Right. The systems that we've been giving Ukrainians are stuff which was obsolescent and which American taxpayer dollars were going to spend to take apart and throw away. And what we're doing right now by not doing anything is we are basically throwing away systems, which from our point of view are too old, instead of giving them to the Ukrainians. The HIMARs that the Ukrainians have been using to great effect are things that we would never use because we were going to throw them away. And so it goes to this point that we have such... We have, in principle, all this military power and we make ourselves laughable when our actual capabilities are so ludicrously off our theoretical capabilities. I mean, that's why the Russian propagandists have trouble containing themselves, is that the stuff that we're going to... It's this. The stuff that we're going to throw away would be enough to help the Ukrainian army defeat the Russian army."
ZTbnIuo58rW,7380,A.B. Stoddard,"We've covered a lot. But I guess, just final. So, if we get back together in, you know, Christmas, or at the end of this year, of this calendar year, debt ceiling will be big, I suppose. Possible government shutdown, and where we end up on that in September. Ukraine aid. I mean, I always hold out the hope that the Biden administration, because they went through this in 2011 and they have been talking about this and studying it for years, that there's no such thing as prioritization. That even talking about that sends a message to global markets, could threaten our credit rating. They were never going to have another downgrade because we came too close in 2011. I mean, that they had put so much mental energy into this, from experience, I still am sort of holding out that maybe in the end this isn't a big deal, and they come up with something to get through it. And I don't think that it's going to hurt Biden's numbers if McCarthy ends up looking good. I don't think voters are going to go, ""Boy, Joe Biden didn't play six-dimensional chess, and Kevin McCarthy got the better of him."" I think we'll just move on. And it'll just be good for Kevin McCarthy, but not bad for Joe Biden to have averted default."
W_4BZkYEdVE,6157,Tim Snyder,"That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that's very explicitly in their mind, that if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia? Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this- No, no. ...forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own... We have bubbles within a bubble, but there's one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often... I just put it very bluntly. We often just don't recognize that there's a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people and say rah-rah when there's not a vote for Ukraine aid."
-8CoMxSpK-7,7650,A.B. Stoddard,"And that's probably what led to the bump in the Morning Consult poll, the new one. And I think that a lot of Republicans who want to move beyond him, like Mark Thiessen at The Post and stuff are saying, ""that was a Biden commercial."" I don't think it was. And to your point, Biden wants us to keep talking about Trump because he thinks it's better when we talk about Trump than when we talk about him. But I don't, and I think the White House was trying to say... that they too were trying to say it was a Biden commercial, but I'm not so sure. So, I think that ubiquity is power, Trump's always known that, at least it is for him, it works for him. And so the more you see him, the more desensitized you become, et cetera. Obviously I'm for Biden over Trump by... not even close call, but I got to say, and I saw just the clips, but Trump looks energetic and in charge and enjoying himself in that debate. And presumably if he's as healthy a year from now, he'll look that way in a presidential debate. And so getting to President Biden, you thought he wouldn't run 10 months ago and that was my view or my wish, I guess, that he might think about arranging a transition even if it's a messy primary to the next generation and so forth, but it looks like he's running."
qIqMxkgTqKS,2647,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Interesting. And then the reconciliation of the budget stuff is 2, 3, 4 months away presumably. And TPS added some of that... I mean at some point someone's going to look up and say, ""I thought these Haitians in Springfield, Ohio was such a crisis and why haven't you done anything if you're on Steve Bannon's side of things?"" Maybe you say that to the Trump White House if you want to sort rev up MAGA against them a little bit. And if you're on the other side you say, ""Are we really going to move these people out?"" Against whom no one in Ohio seems to have any real issues except JD Vance maybe but the governor thinks it's fine and the mayor thinks it's fine. And I guess some of that stuff... So, it does seem like it's more gradual than people have been saying. That is, these different issues will hit the- With the Haitians- The rubber will hit the road at different times in different areas of immigration and different areas of the country and in different circumstances, I suppose. Exactly. And I think if I can leave your audience with one message, it's that this stuff is way more complex than the politicians in DC make it out to be. And when you look at the Haitian population, some Haitians will have humanitarian parole, some will have temporary protected status, some will have Green Cards, some will be asylum applicants who don't have either."
NSDNrH7KZF0,7259,Jack Goldsmith,"So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years. So it's going to be very hard to say, okay, we now know what's going to happen because he could... And who knows which one of his new subordinates he's going to have fallings out with. He's already fired his White House council before and gotten a second one. He's lost one nominee. I mean, this idea that this is going to be a disciplined organization compared to the first one I think is yet to be proven. And I suppose just on the first three or four months, we'll also see these second and third tier appointments, which the overall character of which you mentioned OLC in particular, but will be pretty important. Does the FBI suddenly have 20 non-career people there working for Patel, or is it basically one director and some career- I'm pretty sure that... Maybe is an inspector general in the FBI or is it in the DOJ? But I'm pretty sure that the FBI director is the only political appointment in the bureau. Up until now, but this will be- Well, we'll see if they can use the civil service rules and the two- I'm going to say that's one instance of just..."
tqmzHLurK6l,5933,Aaron Friedberg,"He did indeed impose or pursue or really permit people in his administration to pursue policies that were quite tough on China, and I suppose he or they deserve credit for that, but he also continues to express this personal affection for Xi Jinping. I think if the Chinese had been smarter and given him this great deal that he was bragging about and just bought a few hundred billion more dollars of stuff from us, some of these other measures, like export controls and technology controls, might not have gotten off the ground. So what's he going to do when he comes back? I don't think he has a principled form of or basis for his opposition to China any more than he does for his opposition to Russia or than for any affinity that he might feel, which I don't think he does, for our democratic allies in Europe. So there's no principle there. So the idea that he's going to follow a consistent tough strategy for dealing with China, I think is questionable at best. People who want to give him the benefit of the doubt, will interpret one nice thing he says about one democratic ally or about Israel, let's say, a country people are concerned about, obviously, and think that's really a sound basis for thinking his foreign policy is going to be fine."
xXKIe3v4S4F,7316,A.B. Stoddard,"Bush. I served in that administration. And Jimmy Carter, so people overdo a little bit how, and we had a string of three incumbents winning with Clinton, Bush and Obama, and everyone decided that's the nature of things. But they were actually pretty close in some of those elections, at least Bush's in '04. Anyway, but I feel like when the mood is wrong-track in the country, to use the pollsters term, I'm not so sure being an incumbent is such an advantage. I don't know if Josh Shapiro or Gretchen Whitmer or whoever you want with the nominee, they could say, ""Well, I don't entirely agree with President Biden. I think President Biden should have done a little more on crime."" Obviously you're going to be the Democratic candidate. Obviously you're pro-Biden. Obviously you're going to praise him effusively at the convention, and there's going to be a lot of praise of Joe Biden. But I just think having someone who could do a little bit of distancing wouldn't be crazy in this environment. But maybe I'm just underestimating how bad the primary would be, how nasty the debates would be, how much of an advantage Biden, having done it for four years, would be. Those are all reasonable concerns on the other side, I suppose. Of course, I'm with you, Bill, that I think that if Biden said, ""Look, we have this great,"" to use Bill's pair, ""this great pair of leaders, Governor Whitmer of a blue state of a swing, important battleground of Michigan and Reverend Warnock, senator from the important swing state of Georgia, they're the next generation."
K0CpfV8LvCx,3290,Doug Sosnik,"I do think that in the context of what I just mentioned, I think he does really appear older to people, not steady to people and not reassuring. And I think those combinations have given Trump an advantage, which as I mentioned earlier, we've now seen show up in the polling. Yeah. The advantage being mostly that Biden's drifted down, not that he's gained that much Trump, right? Well, but they also have finer memories of their economic situation. Yeah, that's a very good point. I mean, Trump can say wacky things and frankly, deplorable and dangerous things about NATO and about God knows what. But... And also I think that the issue of the border is both a real issue but also a proxy. It's a real issue in the sense that there's no metric you can look at about border crossings or anything else that's been done since Biden became president and be able to fashion a positive story out of that. And also you see the impact now all across America and these blue states and blue cities like New York and Chicago and Denver, Colorado, where these migrants, illegal crossings now being flooded into these areas. And people feel the impact every day when they're walking around and see these people sleeping on the streets and the safety."
sc7iG64_3IV,6907,A.B. Stoddard,"But for their silence, he has definitely talked a good game, because it's succeeded in silencing the Freedom Caucus. And so, again, I don't know how long that lasts. But this, to this date, is very impressive. And I think that Biden now is facing that loud left that he hasn't heard from. Pramila Jayapal is mad, because he's saying maybe he will actually agree to Kevin McCarthy's request for work requirements for SNAP and TANIF and other government aid programs. And the left is going nuts. And so it's a bad time when you've just announced that you're running for reelection, and people in the party think you're too old to get in another fight about this stuff. But it is looking like that's, potentially, one of the things he might agree to. Long way until the final package, we don't know the outlines of that today. But I'm surprised that he is in a situation where Kevin McCarthy looks so pulled together. The House Republican Conference looks so united. And Joe Biden is getting snapped at on the record by Pramila Jayapal. This is not what he wanted. It is kind of amazing. I mean, things so often go the opposite from one expects. I mean in 2020, the Democrats won the trifecta when they won the Georgia Senates."
ER9T6q70Hmo,5824,Aaron Friedberg,"They're probably going to continue along the path they've been following. The biggest uncertainty is what we're going to do. And I think that does depend on the outcome of our election. And it may be that there's greater variance or greater potential variance in some of these domains than others, but there is a great deal of uncertainty. And as a result, there's a great deal of anxiety on the part of our allies about what direction U.S. policy is going to take and what the implications for them may be. Maybe this was eased somewhat back in 2020 by the outcome of the election. And I think for the most part, our friends and allies have been content. They haven't always been pleased by everything that Biden Administration is doing, but I think they've found it to be more predictable. And there is this underlying anxiety, both in Asia and in Europe, and more so in Europe, probably, about what exactly a Trump 2.0 would look like. So that hangs over all of this. And so explain that in more, why isn't this just the normal Bush, V. Kerry in 2004? There's always been some uncertainty and some differences in opinion about what we should be doing during the Cold War and during the post-Cold War era. But is this like that, or something more fundamental?"
8quOW2xKTAr,3897,Doug Sosnik,"I think on the Democratic side, back to the Yogi Berra quote, they haven't taken the fork in the road, and, in fact, this is something I've written on and I haven't published it yet, there's going to be an enormous reckoning for the Democratic Party that's going to happen the day after the election, regardless of whether Trump is elected or not. And you've got a combination of forces that are really going to explode the day after the election. What is the nature, as you said earlier about the nature of the Democratic Party, which is really, I call it almost a federation of interest, whether you're motivated by gun control, or pro-choice, or Black lives matter, or unions, or the environment. But what you've got is a party that's got really stunted growth. And the reason it's been stunted is, the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, and the Obama-Biden administration have now controlled and dominated American politics for over 30 years. So there's an entire generation of Democratic elected officials had never had an opportunity to rise. Secondly, Obama, who got elected, is essentially challenging the Democratic establishment. When he got elected president, he didn't care about the Democratic party. He didn't care about democratic candidates. He never took all his data file of millions of supporters and went to the DNC."
IT5lhu6AwXC,9145,Mark Esper,"Yeah, that's probably wise. A lot of them knew you had served in senior positions in the Bush administration and then on the Hill for Senator Frist and stuff. So it was a tribute actually to you that... The book A Sacred Oath from 2022 I think, people should read that really important, I think chronicle of the Trump years and of the actual substance of the policy decisions as well as some of the drama and all that. But we can get back to that. Let's begin in the present, we're at a very important moment. We're speaking on, what is it, Wednesday, April 17th, big debate on the Hill about aid for Ukraine, which has been delayed for a while. I mean, this is an issue you worked on a lot, both for over the years and decades, but certainly as Secretary of Defense, NATO, Ukraine, Russia. Why does it matter? How important is it? Is it really, really fundamentally important? Give me your take on this. Well, look, the bottom line is I do think it's very important. And why is that? I go back to the basics, right? When I came into office as Secretary of Defense, I said that my top priority would be implementing the National Defense Strategy. And the core assumption of the National Defense Strategy was we're now in this era of great power competition where our adversaries were no longer terrorist groups and insurgencies."
D-3Ryb5nmqd,8912,A.B. Stoddard,"So I do think McCain totally crashed and burned in 2007. So in a way, I've always thought resetting is better than not resetting, even if the reset is awkward And I guess the question though is reset to what, right? And you identified 10 months ago, the problem with running as, I'm better than Trump, but I'm not going to criticize Trump. Trump's being unjustly persecuted. Trump was a very excellent president, but you need me. Why exactly? Well, because I'm younger maybe, but Trump looks pretty vigorous. I can win. But Trump's kind of even with Biden in the polls. I mean, Jonathan Last, our friend and the editor of The Bulwark , has made this point many, many times. It's hard to run against someone when you don't make the case why you would be a better president than that person. And then it becomes electability or fresh face, but that's a little tenuous. I don't know. What do you think? I guess that would bad question. Does he have to take on Trump, or could events, indictments, for example, wound Trump enough that DeSantis can be sort of, ""I'm not Trump, but I'm not taking on Trump?"" Right. So, first of all, I totally agree with you about early stumbles can really help the maturation of a presidential campaign and candidate."
xkadlI6HvBV,8918,James Carville,"And I'm not doing it like you tell me to do it. I'm doing it my own way. And by the way, he'll have a point if he wins. He told you on day one what he was going to do. He told you the kind of people that he was going to appoint and he's going to take that as a complete justification to do whatever I want to do. I didn't hide it from the voters, I told them. And to some extent, he is telling us. And it's always the thing that a voter hears. We say in one breath, ""You're going to do all these horrible things."" In the next breath we say, ""Don't vote for him because you can't believe a word he says."" Well, that's where you get into a jam. Do you believe him or not believe him? And I think when it comes to his own personal power, you always have to believe him. FYeah. And he'll say anything to acquire more of that. But I don't know. But it's a contradictory message. You can't believe a word he says, but you have to believe that he's going to end the Constitution as we know it. Yeah. And it fits in with... I hear this from ex-Republicans who were tempted to go back to Trump all the time: ""Well, the first term the guardrails held."
kszzB8Tydda,8108,James Carville,"And if you think about it, if you're a net-saver, you live in a pretty good economy, even given the cost of living everything. But these young people see no hope that they'll ever buy a house, interest rates, insurance rates, they're completely priced out of market. These thieves that run these institutions of higher learning, who Scott Galloway correctly called your alma mater hedge fund that has classes- A very wealthy hedge fund, right? 52- Yeah, a lot of people feel like they can't afford it, and I would urge Biden to talk about the things that he's done to help people get through the cost of living, like prescription drug price caps and releasing the strategic petroleum reserve. And there's another thing that I would really urge him to talk about, it's not very fancy, it's always been around, it's always popular, but never enforced, is just put the minimum wage at $15. You're doing terribly with younger voters and black voters. Well, there's a lot of young people and black people that make the minimum wage. If you look at the historic chart of the value to minimum wage, you can see. And so, not only you're going to raise somebody making $7.50 an hour, somebody who's making $12 an hour, their salaries will go up appropriately."
ZnYc1sBmwV6,6327,Invisible Rulers,"It really became, I think, this wake-up call as people began to realize that what an algorithm curated... Because what was happening with the Twitter algorithm, just for people who don't know or weren't aware, is that if you followed one terrorist account, it would show you more. And so you'd follow one, it would say, ""You might like..."" and then it would show you three or four more. ""You might like. You might like. You might like."" And that wasn't just... It would also be true if you followed an account about Mozart, it would show you other classical music ads. RENÉE DIRESTA: Exactly. It wasn't being pro-terrorist, it was just... RENÉE DIRESTA: No, sorry. I feel like I'm so immersed in the weeds of it. No, no, no. You said it correctly. RENÉE DIRESTA: If you follow Elon Musk now, it gives you Marjorie Taylor Greene and Jim Jordan. No, but that's why I'm about to contrast it perhaps, and I will ask this leading question ahead of time, which is, it feels like Twitter was neutral, and you should go on and explain the problem even with, let's call it being neutral, about steering people to what they already have shown an interest in. But that's one level, and another level would be not being neutral and purposely trying to steer people to one, well, to a certain point of view or to a certain conspiracy theory, or whatever."
pGSylFM3jkG,6726,Tom Tugendhat,"Look, I mean, Bill, the point I was making in that speech I gave in August last year was that it's not just Afghanistan, right? The fall of Afghanistan led countries like Russia to believe that we weren't serious anymore, which is one of the reasons he invaded Ukraine. He didn't think we were serious. He didn't think we'd do anything. He didn't think we'd react. And had President Zelensky not demonstrated that extraordinary courage, and had Ben Wallace not got the weapons in early, so that the Ukrainians were able to defend, I think he might have been right. I mean, that's the scary thing. He might have been right. As it turns out, he was wrong, thank god, but he was wrong, and because he was wrong, instead of countries around the world looking at Afghanistan as they did, and thinking, ""Hang on a minute, why do a deal with the Americans? Why do a deal with the Brits? Why do a deal with the free world? Why not just do it straight with China? Why not do it straight with Russia? They're going to win anyway. You know, the guys in Washington and London aren't serious. They're soft. Might as well go for the guys who actually mean it, who'll stay, who will endure, who will stick by you, who may punish you, but who will at least be with you,"" you know?"
GTTOaUP607R,7024,Jack Goldsmith,"They're going to be pinned down on their views, and it'll be interesting to see if... I actually expect this to happen. I expect Pam Bondi to say, as Trump just said, that she's going to be independent and that of course, the president has the constitutional authority to order her to do whatever he wants, as he reminded us, and he does. But she is going to be independent. They're going to have the White House context policy, which actually doesn't impact the president so it's a no-brainer for them. It's in her interest to say that. I hope she realizes that and I hope she does that. Even Patel, in talking with the Senators, he hasn't been emphasizing killing FISA. He's been emphasizing ending the fentanyl crisis, stopping crime, et cetera. That's smart. So we'll learn a lot in the confirmation hearings. We'll learn a lot in the first three months of governance. And I think in three or four months, we'll have a sense of how much the lawfare is going to get going, whether there can be special counsel appointed. So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years."
FdZvTKOGfSk,8297,Mark Esper,"Externally, I mentioned think tanks and associations and members of Congress and labor unions and companies who are part of the defense industrial base and venture firms, what I'm doing now. I mean, all these people are in that system and you have to figure out how do you allocate your time? It's the most precious thing you have is allocating your time to hear about an issue, to try and solve a problem and do so in a way that gives you the greatest return on investment, and that is how you think about every day. And then on top of that, you have the things that just happened out of the blue. I describe in my memoir how I had returned from a meeting and was trying to catch up on some things. And next thing I know, my chief of staff burst into the room. I just thought it was kind of some internal issue that popped up or the White House was calling, but he pops into the room and says, ""Secretary, we need to get you to the command post or to this office very quickly, 'cause we have a civilian airline or civilian plane that's in the National Defense Airspace and we can't contact it and you may have to shoot it down in the next three or four minutes."" And that'll get your attention pretty quickly, Bill."
FpNjhWwwuJg,5240,Tim Snyder,"Rather than just saying, ""Okay, there are other people in the world who have agency, the Russians have agency, they decided to invade Ukraine, the Ukrainians have agency. They decided to defend themselves. What now makes sense in terms of our own interests, both moral and political in this situation?"" And there are many things which have been wrong with our response, but I think that's a big part of it. Again, regardless of where people start out politically, is that we have trouble seeing that situations are not primarily about us. Yeah. It was not until, I think, after February 24th, 2022, that I went back and looked in a little more detail at America First in 1940. And I of course knew about it, but I kind of assumed America First had been going in '38, '39, and then more famously in 1940 with Lindbergh and so forth. And I didn't realize America First, the committee, the actual America First Committee was started after the invasion of the Low Countries and of France in 1940, and when the Battle of Britain was roaring in the most dramatic moments, really, of it. So the people in the US, the political forces in the US who wanted us to stay out, which slid very quickly into sympathy with Nazi Germany, were more sympathetic after the brutality and after all the excuses about its German parts of Czechoslovakia or whatever had collapsed, and after it was perfectly clear what was happening."
0lUF_a9qeAB,14458,Anne Applebaum,"I want to ask you both, how far along are we on this road towards authoritarianism, I guess, I'll just call it? Towards autocracy? ANNE APPLEBAUM We're far. I mean there isn't like, a moment- And also, where does this go in the next months and years? So, there isn't a moment when we say, ""We've crossed a line and there's no return,"" and nor do I want to give people the idea that it's all hopeless and there's nothing you can do about it. I mean, we still have the Bill of Rights and we still have plenty of good people. And at the state level there are even some fantastic people and I suspect even deep in the federal government, there are good people too. And in theory, we still have Congress and we have the other branches of government. So, it's not as if it's hopeless. But I think Americans need to understand that this trajectory is not unfamiliar. We've seen it in other places before. We like to think of ourselves as exceptional and so on, but actually, the way we're going is following a known path. And that known path leads also to other known places. It leads to falsified or rigged elections. It leads to imbalances in the system whereby... I don't know. Here, I'm inventing possibilities, but whereby the federal government could put pressure on donors to the Democratic Party, could make it hard for Democrats to run election, could seek to create an unfair playing field."
XWY-XkCnUWy,7213,AB Stoddard,"I have watched them look away from, again, Elon, who is completely conflicted outside of government, unelected, taking away the power of the purse. I've watched them ignore this Signal thing, humiliating Zelensky at the White House. Don Bacon, who's a congressman, who's an Air Force brigadier general, write in op-ed in the New York Times , just basically pretending like this is some other Republican party. He's like, we need to stand up to Putin and make clear that we oppose authoritarianism and we represent democracy. And this is a Ronald Reagan moment. It was just a cry for help. It was so not facing the reality of Trump's Russian alliance and his abandonment of NATO. And so maybe in the months to come, they get more clear about that, about destroying alliances, eviscerating NATO, the importance of standing up to Putin. Maybe I can see that as the one subject area in which they move, but I don't see them opposing him on the way he's trampling the constitutional order. And I think that we will have days when Kash Patel and Pam Bondi unleash just unthinkable things to serve Trump's whims and corrupt the rule of law. And I do not expect for Republicans in Congress to come out and say, ""This is not the way we do things in this country."" I just don't."
x0w8RrXMntW,9041,A.B. Stoddard,"And Trump does look cheerful in his own way and at home, comfortable, certainly on the stage. I mean, that was, for me, the take. I was traveling during the CNN Town Hall, and I'm curious to get your thoughts on that, very curious. But I mean, what struck me from a distance watching some clips is Trump is good at this and Trump has done it a zillion times. He's better. He's older, but I'd say he is better at it actually than he was in 2015-16, or maybe even 2020 a little more. It was such an easy one, that town hall. But if you're an incumbent, 2015-16, he hadn't run for president before 2020. He wasn't incumbent, which meant he couldn't simply not, he did sort of have to defend certain things he had done in office, which is a little awkward. Now he can just] be as demagogic as he wants, but also on other issues, not be quite as right wing as DeSantis, let's say on abortion or something like that, or not pick really ridiculous fights with Disney. Because the base is so attached to him that they'll forgive a little bit of heterodoxy. So I guess what I'm struck by, and I want you to talk about this, but he's just a better demagogue as of now than DeSantis."
uD4SBIKrozV,8774,Robert Kagan,"Right. I don't know. The problem is, even for Democrats, of course, it's very easy for them to fall into the yeah, well, this has been... It's just like Ronald Reagan. Trump is just like Reagan. There are a lot of Democrats who are like, ""Yeah, this is just Reagan, more Reagan,"" and they don't understand, or even W. The amazing thing is that Democrats don't understand that actually George W. Bush is very much a liberal in the classic sense. His policies were very liberal. He was unbelievably pro-immigration. He did things today, which would have him driven out of the Republican Party, and Reagan I think was a complicated character. FDR was his, not childhood hero, but his hero as a young man, and he was a Truman Democrat. So I think he was what I would call a liberal conservative as opposed to an anti-liberal conservative. And so the inability to distinguish, I think, has been, I don't know if it's been damaging, but certainly it's led to an intellectual failure to see what's different. And not just about Donald Trump, but by the movement that Donald Trump represents. That movement did not control the Reagan administration. They were basically fed crumbs from the table during the Reagan years and ended the Reagan years very disillusioned by the Republican Party."
hZ63G7kFP-6,3384,Doug Sosnik,"Now, that's where the problem right now is, is that Trump, as I said earlier, is kind of bumping up to the high end of his ceiling, and Biden is at least bumping up to the bottom of his floor. And if you have, all of a sudden, with a relatively evenly divided country, one of the guys is at that high part of their floor and the other's at the low part, or towards their ceiling, that gap becomes real and meaningful, and that's what you're seeing in the polling. But I think that in many ways we have two Americas, and we use education as the sort of proxy for defining these tribal differences in our country, but it's really cultural as much as it is economic, and there are economic impacts that affect the culture, and that's why it's so much more deep-seated. I'll just tell you a quick story. So when Trump was president, I used to go to speak to Democratic groups, and in the questions and answers they'd say, ""I don't understand why these non-college voters are voting for Trump. The economic policies of Trump favor the rich. Why are these idiots supporting him?"" Then I'd go to a Republican group and they would say, ""I don't understand these young college graduates-then name a color."
pWBzoBxb6cI,8263,James Carville,"And this is one of these things where he could hurt... Biden has a chance to help himself. But let's say that he goes. If I were his debate coach, I would say that I am not outsourcing Supreme Court picks. Plain and simple I will ask every prospective nominee. Do you believe there's an inherent right to privacy in the Constitution as I do? If they answer yes, I would say, ""Do you believe that the Supreme Court should operate under the same code of ethics as federal district courts do throughout the United States."" Answer's yes, I'll consider that nominee, because I think it'll really, really drive hope. And Trump's trying to... you can watch him. He's ""Oh, I'll have every state, I'll think of something. We're going to have great policy."" And it is the best issue that Democrats have. It just is. Time and time again, you see it proving itself in one special after another. So that has to be part of President Biden's reelection strategy, an integral part. But it has to be said in a way that people can understand. Yeah, I think the backward-looking, ""he's responsible for jobs"" is okay, but the way you put it is good because it's forward-looking, right? I'm going to do this as president in the next four years."
wSKVXcspULy,7041,Tom Tugendhat,"I feel like this could be a pretty big moment 2022. Or is that fanciful? No, I think you're right. No, I think you're right. I think it is a big moment. Look, I mean think whatever element of support you think that we, you, anyone else should be giving to Ukraine, it's perfectly obvious that you can't ignore Putin anymore. You can't ignore Russia. You can't pretend that autocracies aren't really threatening violence against liberal democracies. You can't pretend that China's threats against Taiwan are just performative anymore. They look preparatory in the light of Ukraine. You can't... Do you know what I mean? There's a whole number of issues that even six to 12 months ago, you could have said, ""Well, a major state on state conflict is so unlikely. A real invasion? Sure. They may try to undermine, they may try to corrupt, they may try to infiltrate, but they wouldn't invade would they?"" And a lot of people were saying that on the 23rd of February. In fact, some Ukrainians I was talking to were saying that on the 23rd of February. I don't think anybody's saying that now about any country. The reality is that state on state warfare, I'm afraid, sadly is a reality again, and I think that's a big change because I think it's a huge wake up moment for even those who thought that we should be doing deals with dictators in various different ways are now realizing that actually, that may be harder than they thought."
Z8wxEiwqu20,7359,A.B. Stoddard,"It's just that I still remain completely stunned that he decided to run again. I don't know that he's going to make it a year and a half on the campaign trail to sign up for another four years and tell us that he can lead the free world until January of 2029. I don't see that. So having covered the Congress for all these years, I know that you can function highly as US Senator well into your 90s, and that's what Chuck Grassley's doing right now at 89 or 90. Joe Biden could do that. Joe Biden's in great shape for an 80-year-old. It's just that being president of the United States is too draining a job for when you are 80. So we were very blessed to have him in the time that we did. I believe he can continue to do his job for the next almost two years. I think he's doing an incredibly important job, particularly overseas, in a way that other Democrats probably couldn't have obviously handled so effectively. I don't believe he's lost a step mentally. I just spoke to someone, a member of Congress, who was with him just a few days ago and said it's not that he doesn't know what's going on, he's not confused, but he's really tired, he speaks more slowly."
5uJOHZTVp4O,7277,Larry Summers,"Let me say three things. The secret sauce of economics is arithmetic, so I think it's useful to just think about some numbers. The average tariff rate in the United States before Trump's first term was 1.5%. During his first term with really very considerable excitement, he doubled it from about 1.5% to about 3%. The proposals that he announced on ""Liberation Day"" took 3% to 28%. So it was a tenfold increase. It was 20 times larger almost than what he had done during his first term. There are differences in view about how to interpret precisely where we are or where things might go, but I know of no thoughtful observer who thinks the number's likely to fall below, well, something in the 12 to 15 range. So we are looking at an increment to tariffs five to 10 times conservatively as that which he applied during his first term. So it's a mistake to think of this as a respite from anything other than insanity. From the perspective of what people expected even on election day, on knowing that Donald Trump had been elected, what today is regarded as an optimistic scenario is a high tariff scenario. So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place."
2jSLpQXxto_,6781,AB Stoddard,"You can't use them as a revenue source and then play whack-a-mole with the tariffs, which is what he's done so far. And so there's so much uncertainty that... I see businesses really suffering because the tariff might look bad on Wednesday, better than following Monday, but they can't make their plans. Consumers, the same. When do I buy a car? When do I sign this lease? How do I move forward? The tariffs go up, they go down. And then I think politically it brings real pain to Republicans where the hardest hit states will be red and they're kind of anti tariff but in his cross hairs. Only a few of them have spoken out this week and he's already been crapping on them on his social media site by name, including Rand Paul from Kentucky, first standing up and saying, this is going to hit the consumer. So I see, I think the normal politics will creep in terms of the tariffs combined with the program cuts in the months to come. I don't know where that leads us, but I think that, I don't know that it helps the Democratic party who doesn't have a leader. I don't know what it does to Trump who's planning to stay in a third term, but I know that it'll cause his disapproval to rise and Republicans to be feeling some pain."
fZlyGqBN31_,8164,Robert Kagan,"Or series of pamphlets, yeah, wonderful. Yeah. Henry Ford was not a tribute. He was the most famous businessman, one of the 10 most famous businessmen in America. He was the great champion of modern... obviously the automobile and of paying people more so they could buy the automobile. So I vaguely remember learning about Henry Ford, I mean for two pages in some high school textbook. And he was great because he was like a Democratic capitalism guy. He understood that you needed the working class to have money to buy the products. Wasn't that kind of the thing about Henry Ford? And I think it wasn't false incidentally entirely. But Ford, it would be sort of as if today, I don't know, one of the heads of the, I don't even know who it would be Facebook or Apple or something, Zuckerberg or whatever, or Steve Jobs were kind of writing books on ""The international Jew, The world's foremost problem."" But Ford was a huge figure throughout the twenties. It wasn't like he was not respectable, right? Yeah, no, he was respectable. He ran for office. He was a great peace advocate. He was an isolationist, but I would think he would've said he was an advocate of peace. And he was Henry Ford, he revolutionized the American economy."
4KF3pgDLdCi,2571,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"What does DACA says? Even I don't remember now. So DACA is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, and was for any person who entered the United States before June 2007. And so, at this point, there are not very many people who are eligible for DACA, even if applications were to reopen, because anyone who entered after that point is not eligible for the program. So we are reaching the point where people brought here as children would not have been eligible for DACA at all. And every single year, we estimate at the American Immigration Council, about 100,000 undocumented students graduate from high school and go to college, and in college, they are there, attending classes... And the reality is they probably won't have a work permit. It's not clear what they could do with their degree. Nevertheless, they are actively taking part in higher education, in the hopes that Congress may finally get its act together and do something. And that population continues to go through the education every single year without having any access to a path to permanent legal status. So they're here, and some administrations are, so to speak, nicer to them than Trump threatens to be. I suppose the question is, will Trump find that ultimately in his political interest to kind of go after people who are graduating from high school and applying to college or working in an undocumented way in building trades or hospitality or something like that, or leave that alone and focus more of the ones who have caused more of a ruckus, more politically been the object of a ruckus maybe politically, the last year or two or three, who are the more recent undocumented arrivals?"

I'm just struck, and I'm not quarreling, I'm just saying explain a little more, or maybe I'm wrong to be surprised by this, but I guess I'm struck that you're fairly confident that Europe as a whole sees letting Putin win in Ukraine as unacceptable. So remember that all three of those countries, Britain, France, and Germany, have all been the subject of, again, Russian sabotage, Russian murders of people in London and Salisbury. The Germans are under a huge amount of pressure from Russian propaganda and Russian political spending and are now very aware of mistakes made in the Merkel era. At least I'm talking not about all Germans, I'm talking about the leadership, what's about to be the leadership of the country. So the CDU and people around it in that world, the Christian Democrats, they've been convinced... I mean, well, I don't want to direct attention to myself... I made a big speech in Germany a few months ago. I won a big prize and there was a lot of... And in the speech I said, the moral thing to do right now if you're afraid of autocracy returning is to support Ukraine, and pacifism is a false argument to be made in these circumstances. It's like being a pacifist in 1938."
uM3NO3bvqKo,6330,Invisible Rulers,"Something on the side, kind of... RENÉE DIRESTA: A tabloid? Yeah, yeah. Maybe that's a good example. Owning a tabloid, owning the Star , whatever that thing in the supermarkets was, as opposed to the New York Times . It gets a lot of readers. It can sort of persuade people for two days that some story about an actor or an actress is true, but it doesn't change our country much, whereas the New York Times ... So it's the opposite, right? I mean, that is really striking to me, if you step back and sort of try to think about this phenomenon, the power of these platforms and these companies. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, I think some people, some governments began to realize that in 2012 during the Arab Spring, when governments toppled as a result of social movement momentum that began on Facebook and Twitter, and they were tools for galvanizing people. One of the interesting things... I think people, when I say the word propaganda, it's so linked to Chomsky in America, this hegemonic persuasion. But so much of it is related to activation, just getting people who already believe a thing to act on it.

tkcxO-VOcNk,6735,AB Stoddard,"Fine, let other people do that. So they can do kitchen in a much more, I think politically potent and compelling way than they're right now. Yeah, and I think imaginative way too, right? I mean, Yeah, they're too... Anyway, we will see if they take some of this advice and it feels like they're going in that direction a little bit, but they always want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And I do think, I've been in a couple of these... spoken to groups of Democrats. ""We have to fix the brand."" Well, you do ultimately have to fix the brand, but no one cares about the Democratic brand right now what they care about is Trump. He's the dominant figure to say the least in American politics. He's unbelievably dominant. And so you have to oppose Trump and you have to take Trump down some. The way I think of it, I don't know if you agree with this, is that this a sort of 2025-2026 agenda, which is really opposing Trump, knocking Trump's numbers down, laying the groundwork for, first of all, let's make sure there really is a free and fair election in '26, but then doing well at it. And then secondly, there's a 2027, 2028 agenda, which is obviously finding a good nominee or a good cast of candidates from whom to choose a nominee, fixing ""the Democratic brand"" in the Bill Clinton way as he did in '91, '92."
skKgZjQmLVT,2776,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It is extended every 18 months. Every 18 months DHS has to make a new decision whether to keep extending it or to terminate it. And so most of the designations now are set to expire in 2026, thanks to the Biden administration very recently extending four TPS designations and some are set to expire in 2025. If Trump does what he did in his first term when he tried to terminate TPS, at the moment when they are set to expire, he will announce that there will be no further statuses but gave everybody one final extension of 18 months and said after those 18 months, that's it. So if he does that again, we would see most TPS designations really expiring in 2027 and 2028. With DACA again Joe Moakley Could he cut them off though now? Could he come into office and say, ""Biden tried to extend this?"" Not immediately. But he can't say, ""I revoke Biden's extension and you Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, you've got to go in three months,"" or something like that? He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on."
QURFSHVhXzC,5696,Tim Snyder,"Yeah, no, it's so true. The tradition of liberalism, of a liberalist that was anti-fascist and anti- communist... I was talking to actually a Democratic member of Congress who I phrased, I think on TV or something, just sounding like Scoop Jackson. I said, ""My first vote was for Scoop Jackson in a primary in 1972."" I was a Scoop Jackson Democrat before I was a Reagan Republican. I didn't know him that well, but he called up and said, ""That was nice what you said about me. But maybe you could say Hubert Humphrey, and not Scoop Jackson, because Scoop Jackson's a bridge too far for my friends here in the Democratic Party."" I'm amazed people even know who he was mostly these days, but it was a funny conversation. But Humphrey, I then actually went and read a little bit about Humphrey, whom I admired as a young man. But I didn't remember that much about his pre-history from before I was born as mayor of Minneapolis. Humphrey was really absolute anti-fascist, and absolute anti-communist, and put his own career on the line in both cases incidentally, and at home and abroad. Fought antisemitism as mayor of Minneapolis when they were... It was not popular to do that. Was a huge, of course, civil rights leader, and was willing to split the Democratic Party in '48 at the convention on that."
gvT8ILKL3Mv,2490,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"We read recently about something in California, they went after some farm workers, and it seemed like a bit of a mini-raid there as a test maybe of how this might work. And there were rumors about a symbolic raid very early in, maybe in the first week of the Trump administration, in some place like DC or New York, that's a... blue states or sanctuary city-type situation, so they can make the point. I mean, say a word about that, but also then more broadly, will there be mass deportations? It sounds like it's very hard to actually mass deport lots of people absent radical changes in the law, which would require congressional action or even with maybe changes in the law. Yeah. And this is why I've sort of been talking about a couple of different visions that the Trump campaign and surrogates for the campaign and now incoming officials have talked about, and there's sort of like the Stephen Miller version and the Tom Homan version. Now, both of those men agree on quite a lot when it comes to immigration enforcement, but the way they talked about- Miller will be deputy chief of staff, and Homan will be head of- He's going to be 'border czar,' which is not a real job. It's unclear what that actually means."

It's a little hard to say he can't do it again or he shouldn't do it again unless you say he can't do it again or he shouldn't do it again. Exactly. It's interesting though that you just said about the establishment, Ron DeSantis a few months ago was looking like the establishment. And Trump could have run... I think he would've if he didn't regain his foothold, would've run against him as he says, ""The backing of all the rhino sellouts, they're coming to get me, we're the outsiders that [inaudible]- He did that a little, right? He liked Jeb Bush, he liked Paul Ryan? Right. And that was because Ron DeSantis had some momentum back then. Ron DeSantis had Fox News , there was a soft ban on Trump. Ron DeSantis had all the love, he had all the donor money, he was doing better in the polls against Trump. In the early states, he was quite competitive with Trump and his campaign liked to point that out. So now I don't think that Ron DeSantis is the establishment, and I don't think he has to worry about that. He can say, ""Look, you've got your senators too, Tuberville and everyone else, you're running around with all your endorsements and you're a former president."" I think there's a way where he can also paint Trump as the establishment, or his allies can do that."

Yeah, I'd say watch this space in July and August and particularly August. Because I mean, I don't like to be superstitious, but a lot of bad things have happened in my experience in August while much of Washington is on a well deserved leave of absence for a summer vacation. Right. Let's close with... that's very helpful actually, something to really think about or worry about, but worry about whichever way, action could be worrisome, inaction could be worrisome, and a US/Israel rift.

And I do think that Walz brings some comfort level to-I don't think direct, but-to the kind of upper Midwest, which is really critical. But math doesn't change. I'm involved with a group. We raised over $100,000,000 and we concentrate on 77 counties in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. None of them, Philadelphia, Detroit or Milwaukee.

There clearly can be events that can have an impact on the outcome of this election. But we're headed to election that not very many people are very excited about that, that's the undeniable truth, and how that turns out in terms of turnout, that's anybody's guess. If you had your 30 seconds with President Biden, any one point you'd emphasize most that they're not doing quite right, or they could be doing that they're not doing, or two points, three points? I would say don't tell people how good the economy is because what happens is he says that, and statistically, he's right. You can point to five things that say the economy has performed well. But the problem you have, Bill, is the economy is great for people like you and I. It is not good for under 35 or under 30. And if you think about it, if you're a net-saver, you live in a pretty good economy, even given the cost of living everything.

They like having branches overseas and dealing with having massive international agreements about obviously banking and credit and so forth. It is very striking therefore, for me that he, not based on any personal, it's not Henry Ford on personal bigotry, I don't believe, just thinks, ""Yeah, he's probably right about immigration."" Why does he think... That is revealing, right? It shows in a way how easy it is to slide from the issues you kind of, makes a certain amount of sense just from a self-interest point of view that you're with the authoritarians on to the issues that they stress, that you're not really with the mind, you haven't thought about much, but I guess maybe there's something there and suddenly you're justifying the anti-immigration stuff.

Iatrogenic illness is when you get sick from or get an infection from being in the hospital. The flip side of it being self-caused is that it does suggest that if rationality comes back, that a significant part of the problems can be attenuated. Yeah, that's so interesting. And it really puts a huge burden, on the other hand, on the political system and the political economic system here. I have to say, Bill, it's obviously not a commentary about you, I have been disappointed by the reluctance of people who do know better to come forward and speak up with expressions of substantial concern. And I don't know whether it's a matter of timing. There's a right time to intervene in a debate, which is far enough into the debate that once intervention will be in mind when the matter is resolved, but not so long that the debate has been lost. And it may be that there are people who are holding their participation because the fire has to burn itself out a bit. They may be making those judgments in prudent and sound ways.

We did four conversations back from 2017 to 2020 I discovered. They sort of blurred together, but they were excellent and stand up well, I think. Jack, a Harvard law professor leading student of the presidency, executive power, law institutions, that's a complex of things. Served in the George W. Bush administration, wrote an excellent book about his experiences there, Law and Judgment Inside the Bush Administration , served in both the Defense Department and then somewhat famously as Assistant Attorney General, the Office of Legal Counsel in 2003, I guess. And then a recent book in 2020 with Bob Bauer that came out at the end of the Trump presidency before January 6th, I think. Yes. Yeah. We didn't have that in the book unfortunately, After Trump, Reconstructing the Presidency , which we could talk about a bit, whether it has been reconstructed. Anyway, Jack has an unusual combination, I would say a deep understanding of the constitution and the more theoretical sort of side of executive power, but really practical experience and someone I think who values judgment and prudence a little more than some law professors do, who are a little more legalistic, if you'll allow me to criticize any of your peers there."

So he was dismissed, but as he made gains, I continued to make the point that he would not ever hold the national interest in regard and that he didn't believe in a constitution or the courts or the Congress in separation of powers, and it was dismissed at the time as, ""Well, this is sort of his style, right? Isn't it fun, like the apprentice-y businessman, he wants it to be the Trump org, and that's great. That's how he runs his family business. Oh, well that's kind of his style."" And at the time, I could sense the danger in that, and if you really had watched his pathologies to put it mildly, it was clear that that would become very dangerous and that we were not, the US government was not to be his vanity project. And in the end he wins. You and I talked at length between '17 and '20. It was clear that he was trying to make the case, lay the pretense for the election to be stolen through the post office and other means should he lose."

So he's been rewarded by the primary electorate and the fact that his rivals cannot bring themselves to criticize any of that. Do you think DeSantis... Two questions. He launches in 10 days or so, does he start criticizing Trump more directly either because he can't win or because he wouldn't actually be as good a president as he DeSantis would be? And also it seems like DeSantis's strategy is focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, if you win both of those, you're probably the nominee, if you win one of them, you have shot at being the nominee, and that's how an underdog typically gets to at least parody with a front-runner, you win Iowa, Obama won Iowa and so forth, McCain won New Hampshire in 2000. McCain fell short, Obama won the nomination, but in each case that's how they became the plausible alternative to the person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W."
TGCXNkiQ4Bd,7775,Mark Esper,"The people who succeeded you had been there for a year, not for two months. Right. Right? What does that look like? Mark Esper, thank you very much for your service to the country, and thank you for joining me here on Conversations . Thanks, Bill. I enjoyed it. Great conversation, so good luck to you and your audience. Thanks. Thanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us on Conversations ."
ekdL3MM4VmD,2333,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"We have also heard, through a wide variety of public reporting, that they want to sign a national emergency declaration to bring back money for the border wall, restart construction on the border wall that had been paused under the Biden administration, and then start building new projects. And then potentially reinstate Title 42, the public health policy that allows officers to expel people to another country without ever allowing them to seek asylum at all, which could actually have a very counterproductive effect on the border because last time they put Title 42 in effect, border crossings rose every single month for a year afterwards. Why was that? Title 42, despite a number of people in DC who talked about how vital this authority was, was a bit of a mess policy-wise. It created very perverse incentives because it was a public health law, it's not an immigration law. And because it's a public health law, there's no permanent immigration consequences for being expelled under Title 42. So you just try again. Yeah, yeah, Exactly. So under immigration law, if you are caught at the border and deported to Mexico, if you try recrossing, that's a felony now. You've committed a felony reentry after removal, and you could potentially be sent to prison and you can be redeported very quickly."
owzw3bW8RYx,5589,Aaron Friedberg,"And it's kind of late to do that. It requires... because we're in a different situation... It's not like during the Cold War where, again, I think people had a general sense of what the problem was. It's a new danger or a new emergent danger that has to be explained and the various pieces of it and how they fit together and why they're threatening has to be articulated in order then to get to the practical question of what it is that you're going to do about it. And I do worry about the Harris administration. I don't want to leave the impression that I think they're going to be great, and I'm highly confident of everything she's going to do. I'm not, and I'm worried about it on, for lack of a better term, on the soft side, I'm worried about the somewhat more left-leaning portions of the Democratic Party that are not going to be inclined to increase defense spending, that are suspicious of foreign entanglements and so on. Biden probably deserves more credit than he gets for not being right in the mainstream of his party that he was to the right of the center of that party. And he kind of brought it along with him on all of these issues to some extent on Ukraine, certainly on the Middle East."
OZ8Ps70yAvc,7951,AB Stoddard,"But what I thought was going to be a more measured schedule... Now I see how effective it is because as soon as you carpet bomb with all of these disruptions and acts of destruction, the sooner the populace is sort of desensitized. And so now that I watch people teaching us more about Orbán, I'm reading more closely, I see that that's actually was smart to create that many explosions that fast. Well, yeah, let's come back to the smart question. Maybe he also was a little too aggressive and we'll see whether the resistance is a little... could be stronger because of the attempt to shock at all and a bit of a reaction to it. But I mean, two things I guess strike me. I'd be curious for your thoughts. On the one hand, I'd say he's gotten further in eviscerating the rule of law than even I expected he would be able to do so quickly. I mean we just have lost even the pretense that we're going to have a justice department that holds anyone in the Trump administration, certainly the Trump White House, but I'd say elsewhere in the administration, accountable and it is entirely now about punishing his enemies and rewarding his friends. So we're so far beyond a little bit of tweaking at the edges and some past administrations where of course your AG is a little nicer maybe to you or people in your party than the other party, but actually a pretty big effort since Watergate, I would say, to almost not do that and to bend over backwards."
Da9Se3YLm7S,7427,Robert Kagan,"Let's talk maybe then about the decade that I found most fascinating that you discussed at different times in your book. It also is important in the previous, in the history of American foreign policy book, which is the 1920s. I think some people might say, ""Well, yes, there was this argument at the founding but that was a long time ago and the liberals won, sort of."" And then there's the Civil War, which was the part they didn't quite win, but that resolved that. And then there's the south, even, in the 1890s. And that's gotten a fair amount of attention, I think, in the last few years, and reminding us how much of a part of American history that is. But what was most striking to me about your book as a historical matter was the discussion of the 1920s, a decade, I've got to say, that... I don't know. I feel like I've read a fair amount of American history. I know probably less about the 1920s than any decade in the last century. And I suspect that's kind of common. It's in between World War I, and it ends with the Depression, and then there's, of course, the '30s. People know a lot about that. But your account of the 20s was so striking. So talk a little bit about what happened in the 20s."
aRZRnR3SUoI,5613,Aaron Friedberg,"Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I'm Bill Kristol. Very pleased to be joined today, once again, by Aaron Friedberg, Professor of Politics at Princeton, a Non-Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a leading scholar of International Relations, in general, and China policy in particular. Most recent book, I think, is Getting China Wrong . That's about Aaron's colleagues, not about Aaron himself, got it right. I believe that's the subtitle of the book. And he did get it right, actually. And we've had a conversation, or two maybe, on China, a very much worth going back to. Our most recent conversation was at the very beginning of this year on China, mostly, as well as the world, in general. But I thought today we could talk about, what are we at, it's Monday, September 30th. After a very busy weekend in the Middle East and the usual busyness elsewhere in the world, I thought we could talk about the general world situation, it's implications for our election campaign, Election Day is five weeks away, and really try to help people think about this moment in international affairs, but also our own political history. So Aaron, thank you for joining me. Thank you very much, Bill. So, maybe let's begin with, I want to get, obviously, to the choice we face, the different foreign policy options facing the American public, and their implications."
8_VJ-peqjGc,5583,Tim Snyder,"There are these people who are going to come and help us out."" Eek. Say a few words about Europe. I mean, generally there are crosscutting trends and tendencies in many different nations, and obviously the different nations are very different. But what's your general sense there, and particular things that either alarm you or cheer you up? I mean, in general, the Europeans are doing better on Ukraine than Americans think. And just to... There's a lot of discussion about GDP per capita spending on defense as a percentage of GDP, sorry, and that's a Trumpist discourse. But if you look at percentage of GDP spent on the Ukraine war, the US is way down the list. Like, we're below Bulgaria. We're below countries that we don't even think are on the Ukrainian side. We're below Malta. We're below the Czechs. We're below pretty much everybody on that measure. And even if you take the total, the Europeans are now way out ahead of us. Different measures are slightly different things, but they're way out ahead of us. So I mean, just as a starting point, it's important for Americans to realize that we're not actually leading. We could be and we should be, we really should be, but we're not. But it's not... The Europeans lack what we have."
P8HQ9AiuQes,4949,Tom Tugendhat,"I represent about 80,000 electors, about 100,000 souls who vote left, right, whatever, for the advantage of Kent, the United Kingdom, and their family across the world. And the reason that I am an advocate for this level of cooperation is quite literally because I think it is fundamentally in the interest of the British people, you know? And I do put my country first. I think that is the job of elected representatives, actually. I mean, I do think it is my job to champion my community and my country first. I think that is literally what I've been elected to do. But I think I do it most effectively when I expand the bounds of freedom. It makes us safer, you know? I mean, it's a huge luxury for us. It's an even bigger luxury for you, but I mean, you guys have an ocean on either side. We have about 20 miles of sea between us and France, right? But what NATO has done, what cooperation has done, what free trade has done is it's pushed the boundary of British liberty thousands of miles to the East and thousands of miles to the South. Now, at the very least, the very least, that's a hell of a warning, that's a hell of a tripwire, right? I mean, if you're setting up claymores to guard your perimeter, you've pushed your perimeter out a hell of a long way."
FUbPDhfjIxy,6587,Invisible Rulers,"Or more than was... I mean, of course, God knows with the thirties and stuff, you can't overstate this and generalize that, and say that it couldn't have happened in the past, it didn't happen in terrible ways in the past. And so that's a good check on the kind of glorification of the nostalgia for the past and thinking everything is totally new. But it does feel like... And the final point, you talk about any of this you want, I mean, the conspiracy stuff strikes me as particularly... I don't know, to fit nicely with the algorithmic way of being, that I mean... And that strikes me as something in the past. Again, people could believe all kinds of wacky things, but again, they got punctured, it seems to me, at some point. Maybe they didn't. I don't know. So talk about any aspect of that you want. I think it's interesting. RENÉE DIRESTA: I want to touch the conspiracy thing because that relates to trust. And I want to talk about two sides to that. But let me answer the part... So hold that in your heads, in case I forget it. But the thirties, the demagogue thing, I was thinking about Father Coughlin, who I have in the book as this interesting case study, because he is the man for the medium."
3MoYEBfRwcZ,3345,David Axelrod,"What do you tell them?"" Instead of sort of doing what you'd expect Joe Biden to do, because he's a person of empathy who grew up in a working class circumstance and identify with the concern, he said, ""I would tell him we've got the strongest economy in the world."" He continues to do that. That is the wrong strategy. The right strategy is to say, ""Look, we've made a lot of progress from when the day I walked in the door as a country, and I'm proud of our country for fighting through this pandemic and getting our back to where we've got this much employment, but the fact is, the way people experience this economy is the way I did when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How much did you pay for the groceries? How do you afford the gas, the rent? These continue to be a problem and I'm fighting that fight."" Then I go through a few things that, so I think he needs to put himself on the side of working people in their economic fight here. That's what we did in 2012. I mean, you remember, Bill, we were still very much feeling the effects of the great recession. We were out of the recession, but people still were stung by the experience of it."
1Vr-4d2dfOW,5981,Tom Tugendhat,"Anyway, Tom, thanks so much for joining me today. Bill, it's good to be with you again. I should also have mentioned Tom was a candidate for Tory Party leadership, which would in turn make one prime minister and did better than everyone expected, but was eliminated in one of those rounds. It's such a complicated system, I'm not even sure how that works. But it seems to me you made it a round or two longer than everyone expected. I made it several rounds longer than anybody expected, [inaudible]. Okay, well even... That's good. So we want to talk about Ukraine, which you've been following very closely and had been an outspoken advocate of a strong Western stance on. And I think were, earlier on, also worrying about Putin and calling attention to the dangers. But I think you were just there a week ago, so we're speaking just on August 31st, so just to locate people when they see this in the future, but you were just there on Ukraine's independence day in Kyiv, if I'm not mistaken? Well, yeah. And I went to Ukraine for their Independence Day, actually. And one of the reasons I went is because some people, I think you are one of those nations, seem to value your independence day very highly. You got your independence off some very, very fine people, but the Ukrainians got their independence off a totalitarian dictatorship and have quite rightly valued it very highly."
aeK27nVZf2W,9941,James Carville,"They have to be very, very careful how he's deployed and they have to husband him pretty closely. And I can't fault them for that, but yes sir, how are you going to address him? Yeah, that's a good point. But in the meantime, you can use paid media and stuff to really remind people. But the big thing is going to be the jury. If there's a conviction, how those jurors come across is going to have a lot to how much people accept this verdict. Yeah, that's interesting. And if Trump loses it, which he might and attacks the jury, I feel like that's an opportunity also to say he's attacking these Americans who are doing their duty. Right? Right. If these jurors, what I'd give to prepare one of them for Sunday morning TV. First of all, collectively, this jury took 21,250 hours out of their lives. We listened to X... 28,000 words of testimony. We sat there and observed every witness. We conscientiously went through every document, and we could arrive at no other conclusion but this. Boom. Boom. And who the jury is, who they elect foreman, how articulate she or he is. Yeah, it all depends a lot, but how that jury justifies what they did can have a lot of effect on public opinion, and we never really considered politics in this, to be honest with you."
7DQA4OLsUcA,6307,Invisible Rulers,"So 10:30 this morning was the RFK Jr. confirmation hearing. I assume he sailed through. I assume it went through on party line. Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised when we're done. I doubt it. But now we have a person who has been propagating the vaccines cause autism conspiracy theory leading Health and Human Services. And that's because, again, in 2015 when he showed up in California to fight against our bill, he was still seen as kind of a crackpot. And then during COVID, he became the anti-Fauci, if you will, the alternate equivalent, the person who was held up as this is the person who's really telling the truth, if you believed that the vaccines were going to hurt you. It is really startling, isn't it? And I guess what happens is two things at once. That is the fact that he's going to be confirmed as HHS Secretary today, assuming that's happening as we speak here on February 13th. If you already were inclined in that direction, this is vindication. The United States said it. You may not have a very high opinion of our institutions, but still you probably have some residual sense that they're important. And the majority of senators voted to confirm him. How can you say that he's just a crackpot? And then if you're in the middle and you're not sure, maybe there is something messed up with our food and too much sugar and whatever artificial ingredients."
hOlLOLrYOvQ,3754,Eric Edelman,"Because China, of course, much larger data, can suck up a lot more data from its billion people than we can. So there is an argument for that at one level. But as you say, Congress, the Select Committee on Competition with China and the Congress formerly co-chaired by Raja Krishnamoorthi and Mike Gallagher, those folks have always been concerned about this and we'll have to see. I mean, as you say, UAE, Dubai is notoriously a leaky place for the transfer of technology to whoever, and that's something that's obviously going to have to be watched as time goes on so that it doesn't go to China. We'll see how much interest the administration has in watching it though. I was struck, you commented, and we've talked about it as the trip was happening, by the appearance Wednesday, and I guess this was in Qatar, if I've got the country's order correct, of the Syrian, the new head of Syria. What do you make of that and what was that about? So it was actually... The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria."
RtlXfRiycYN,5373,Tom Tugendhat,"And bad, I'm not trying to make a moral term, I'm trying to make... The ones that are more successful are the ones that are enabling, and the ones that are less successful, the ones that are challenging the nation states, or the nation states feel are challenging them. So, it's interesting how NATO has maintained its legitimacy by being an enabler, not an actor. And I think that's a very powerful thing to do, and one of the things that we are going to have to think about over the next, take your pick, five, 10, 20 years, is seeing how we think about that again. Because it's worth remembering that these organizations, when we first created them, when the WTO or the IMF or whatever it was were created in those postwar days, they were created in many ways as partnership organizations, as enabling organizations. Democracies, free countries, and rule of law states to work together. And they were set up quite deliberately as responses to the communist block in its various different guises as the common internal Soviet block or whatever it happens to be in whichever guise it was. And they were created not to replace the nation states. They were created to enable countries that had very often only recently rediscovered their liberty. Countries like France initially didn't join the World Trade Organization in order to be subsumed into a greater hole."
EqKSHiyJ8XY,9811,Mark Esper,"He does need some professionals around him. He would sometimes at least often take their advice or look the other way as you didn't quite do things that he had off the cuff wanted you to do or whatever and so forth. But it does feel like since 2020, that process, let's say, of liberating himself from these different constraints and guardrails I would call them has accelerated. If anything, it hasn't gone back. He didn't rethink everything after January 6, 2021 and say, ""You know what? I should have listened to Mike Pence. I should have listened to Mark Esper. I should have listened to Bill Barr. I shouldn't have gone down any of these paths."" Well, look, every president learns on a job. There's no training to be president, although, some have less of a learning curve than others. George, again, H.W. Bush, who knew D.C., he knew the instruments of government is an example of somebody who had less of a learning curve. So I don't fault a president for learning on the job. Trump did not take those lessons as well. Look, in many ways, things we were recommending pushing back against proved to be true. I often wonder whether he looks back and says, ""Thank goodness they were pushing back on me."" The best example is Afghanistan."
290qRfx1__d,6672,AB Stoddard,"Everything else makes me worry. The new DNC chair Ken Martin is saying things like, ""Oh, our message is fine. We just need to connect it to the voters."" Like, no, their message is not fine. There's a lot of hesitance. You and I have talked about this. Where have they been on the deportations? I mean, this week we learned a man protected by temporary protective status who fled to this country from violence in El Salvador and is from Maryland and is married to an American and has two kids and is not a criminal, I guess, has some traffic violations, was deported to Venezuela. And the government's response is, he can't be returned to the US and a court ... It's too late. He's gone and he doesn't get his due process. They admitted the error. This is so beyond enraging and tragic, and where is the response from the Democrats? So that's tied up in, oh, immigration is a toxic issue because Biden completely abdicated his responsibility to secure the border. He wouldn't touch this issue because it divided his party and then it destroyed him politically and the rest of them don't want to talk about it. So there's a lot of things I see them pulling their punches on, which is ridiculous. And I get their liabilities, their political liabilities, they're hamstrung by a lack of leader."
Wfg9NRg73AO,6651,Jack Goldsmith,"My view is that given the modern world, given foreign dangers and domestic complexity, and really the nature of the Constitution as it was set up, vigorous presidential leadership is vital to make the Constitution work. But to also quote Schlesinger, the government runs best when the president has checks and balances stitched into his breast and values those things and understands that there are implicit constraints on his powers, even if they're not written in law. So that's the ideal in my opinion. Bob Bauer and I wrote this book in 2020, and it was basically a book about how President Trump in his first term had identified a whole slew of loopholes and deficiencies in the post-Watergate regime of executive branch accountability. He wasn't, we made clear, the first person to start chipping away at the post-Watergate norms, but he definitely was much more aggressive and successful in kind of exploding the norms, circumventing the laws, and so we wrote this book that had a vision of how to restore the presidency, this powerful presidency, but subject to proper constraints. We had 50, 55 proposals and almost all of them got basically nowhere. As soon as Trump left office, nobody seemed to care anymore, including the Biden White House, to my disappointment to kind of doing what I thought it would take to put the presidency on a sounder footing."
tJqPuKFTW2q,6285,AB Stoddard,"Well, again, I mentioned before that I am just horrified at how much they wasted the transition, a leaderless party. That's so interesting. I hadn't really focused on the transition as a key moment. People have now focused- It's almost three months. Yeah... yeah, that they could have really gotten a lot of stuff lined up, right? But that's how broken they were. They're so divided. They're so mad at Biden, but they're not coming out and publicly telling the voters we're sorry. We stood by a man who was unelectable who needed to retire. We looked the other way. We pretended it was okay. So there's a lot of rage from the voters across political ideological spectrum, but then also among their party about them sticking by Biden and not kicking him out and providing them with a better alternative. And then they have no leader, so they're really angry at each other and we have a left-right chasm also in the party, where progressives are saying, if you'd only talked about a minimum wage and these other things... saving the climate, you would've energized more voters to turn out for Harris. That's actually not true. David Shor, who's the Democrats, maybe the best political, but the data scientist, but the Democrat's best one has just released his findings of the 24 election showing that if reluctant and non-voters showed up, all registered voters showed up, Harris wouldn't have lost by 1.5 points, she would've lost by five because those voters are trending to Trump."
ahb7hEOX8R7,3987,Doug Sosnik,"What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring of '95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching him. And that really struck me, that struck fear with me. And I do worry a little bit that at some point the public is going to shut down on Biden in terms of giving him another look. And he's got two related but different challenges right now. One is to inspire and motivate his base to not only support them, but to turn out. And it's far from a given that that's going to happen. And then the other of course is with the swing voters in the handful of states that'll determine the next president if it's a close election, his numbers with the swing voters are lagging his overall numbers, which are quite bad. The kicker view in your New York Times piece was that disqualifying Trump might not be enough or likely wouldn't be enough. You can't just do that. I think Democrats have really been counting on that to a considerable degree. Explain that a bit. I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don't think have either thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary Clinton's campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message."
tNlmLk4wyD8,5752,Tim Snyder,"That will keep you going for a while, but it won't keep you going indefinitely. I think they're going to have a hard time getting to 2025, and that's why they're so heavily invested in us right now. That's why we've heard so much about how they're winning, and Ukraine is losing, and let's all throw up our hands. This whole fatigue thing, everyone's supposed to be tired, which I think is completely ridiculous. What are we supposed to be tired about? We're just sitting here watching and occasionally voting on something, that doesn't make you tired. I think Russia's in trouble, and I think they are... This is unpleasant for us, but if we don't see it, we're never going to. They see Capitol Hill as the shortest route to Kyiv. That's how they see it, and we have yet to prove them wrong about that. Their politics are, in a sense, very closely related to our politics at this point, because they are counting on Mike Johnson and on Donald Trump to get them through. That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory."
YdVFt077pz7,8565,A.B. Stoddard,"Oh, sorry, South Dakota, about the E. Jean Carroll verdict. And if you have, that was a civil defamation case, on a serious indictment or maybe for obstruction of justice, if you have people say, ""We just can't nominate someone like this, that's doing the work for Ron DeSantis."" So a few things have to align in order for him to avoid criticizing Trump. He will be asked by every reporter wherever he goes, maybe sometimes voters, but in the end is he going to have to criticize Trump on the debate stage because we don't think that Trump's going to show up? So it's very hard now for me to see how this plays out without just damage happening to Trump because of Trump. Maybe this accusation that Rudy Giuliani was trying to sell pardons at two million a pop and maybe Trump was involved in, we don't know, things could happen that weigh Trump down that would help Ron DeSantis, but I think he has to screw up the courage to say, ""I am running because we need a better nominee. I am better for these reasons."" And I think he has to find a way to say that with strength. Yeah, I think that's right. For all that the Republican establishment is discredited allegedly and mixed blessing, I do think having a lot of these senators and governors just weigh in the way you just said would have some effect on those swing maybe Trump voters."
7KsMzBUoQx6,3414,Doug Sosnik,"But no, look, it's a very important point and a good point that you make. And it's not just for leaving people happy after one gives a speech, though I agree with that. I'm falling short on that too. They always do want you to leave the audience. ""These people didn't come to hear you just get them... Leave them depressed. They're going out to play golf after your lunch speech, and they want to be in a good mood."" It's like, ""I'll do my best."" But you did your best, and it's a very serious point, it's a good point. But meanwhile, we'll need to get together maybe what, midsummer, to see where we are. What would be the time where we'll really know much more about the shape of things to come before the conventions, I guess? So, I remember when I was in the White House, you always want to be strategic and not tactical. And a big part of that is, planning, going from election day and working backwards. And then looking at to the extent you can, what are the phases that we're dealing with, and how are we going to win the phases? Now, this was over 30 years ago, I wrote a speech in the summer of '95 about the phases of the election that, I gave that same speech for 15 months."
ppYay2PdbNt,9542,James Carville,"I do, and it's much better. I think just Susie Wiles is kind of a professional, and it does seem, and other people have said the same thing, it was more of a haphazard, by-the-seat-of-your-pants, Steve Bannon, everybody fighting over money. I do think it's more disciplined. I agree with you, and I think that a lot of people would agree with you. And I think it's led to some underrating of them in a sense. Everyone keeps waiting for them to make some horrible mistakes, but they're running a pretty, except for Trump personally to some degree, they're running a pretty disciplined campaign. What they did in the primaries was really remarkable. We tend to write that off. He was an incumbent, polarizing figure. You would say, ""Well, he's going to get what he starts out with...""And actually he ended up with a lot. What they did to Ron DeSantis, what Susie Wiles did to Ron DeSantis has to be one of the great cutting jobs I've ever seen in politics. But he didn't even know what hit him. They had him eating pudding with his fingers. And the story is she was the big operative. She made him. He was this guy with no personality and she got him elected to Congress. He was not supposed to win for governor."
7LOLXLXoCVB,3383,Doug Sosnik,"I think we're going to have a pretty good idea where the economy is headed towards September and election day at that point. And so, we'll move into the summer with the Republican Convention and the Democratic Convention. It's sort of a second phase. And then I think the third phase will be late August immediately following the Democratic Convention in Chicago. That third tranche will be the general, the final lap for the general election, as I mentioned earlier, when you'll see people voting. A lot of people voting in September, and certainly by mid-October. So that's how I would look at the cycle in those three phases. No, it's very, very helpful, really. And we'll get together maybe in June, I think, and let's see where we are in the economy, the- A lifetime from now. ...and it will be. God knows, as you say, last time we talked October 7th hadn't happened, and all kinds of other things since Trump was in question, and Biden might not run. So, Doug Sosnik, thank you very much for joining me today. Really a fascinating conversation. Great. Thanks for having me. And thank you for joining us on Conversations ."
kkYyMQpGm6U,3777,Eric Edelman,"So in Riyadh, the Saudis promised $600 billion in investment, the Qataris offered I think 1.2 billion, and then the Emiratis offered about 200 billion in AI deals, joint investments in artificial intelligence, which total up to roughly $2 billion worth of trade and investment. I want to come back to those numbers in a second. But Trump has said now a couple of times in different fora that he went and he got $4 trillion, not 2 trillion, 4 trillion or $5 trillion. So his hyperbole, his need to exaggerate and that he got this personally, when a lot of this was business deals that were already sort of underway, company-to-government or government-to-government entities, were already engaged in all of this. So one of the things that's very hard to parse when you look at the fact sheets is how much of this is going to be actually accomplished in Trump's term? How much of this is new? How much of it actually began before he arrived on the scene? He seems to be aware of this slightly because he's also told the press that some of this is going to come to fruition after he's left office and other people are going to take credit for it. He said, ""But you guys have to remember, I'm the one who did it."
RgG9vNPkKUi,2417,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"But does that happen again? we'll have to see. So interesting. Well, this has really been terrific, Aaron. Thank you. It's so complicated. But it's very interesting though to get a sense of the complexity of it, I think, and to see how silly a lot of the debate is, but also to really think about what... There are some big inflection points and choices ahead. And so thank you for helping us understand that. Yeah, thank you again for having me. We'll have to have you back in a few months and we'll see where we are in this very complicated issue, which a lot of people feel very strongly about, and rightly so. This is so central to our national identity, and that leads some of us to have some sets of views and others to have different sets of views, but the issue's not going away, that's for sure. So, Aaron, thank you and thank you all for joining us on the Conversations ."
BrYIcMVVF1N,9930,James Carville,"I think Trump does not think it hurts him to have two males on the ticket. I think everyone thinks he's going to pick a woman or a minority, but I don't know that he... I think he has a sort of view which is pretty cynical, and we may not like it, but that two older white rich guys, that's kind of attractive to Republicans, and it's not that unattractive to a certain type of swing voter who thinks, well, those guys know what they're doing. They're business guys, they're et cetera. Tough guys. He seems pretty intent that he's going to do it his way. He's telling you, ""We're not going to have any of this General Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn. We're not going through that anymore."" He's really laying the groundwork to say, ""I ran on this. I told you I was going to do this. Now I'm going to do it."" And I could see somebody saying, ""Well, if you pick another white male, you're going to get a lot of flack."" And he said, ""That's exactly the kind of flack I want."" That may be just what he wants to do. And I'm not doing it like you tell me to do it. I'm doing it my own way. And by the way, he'll have a point if he wins."
lN1SAcDd2xS,7095,AB Stoddard,"To try to educate the public on what's coming. That Trump in the end intends to control the rule of law, the courts, everything. But he wants to control elections. He wants to find a way to a third term. I don't care if Republicans would say, ""Of course he's saying this. He doesn't want to be a lame duck, so he doesn't really mean it. And the 22nd amendment..."" No, Democrats have to push this into the debate. ""Okay, Republican congressman or senator, are you really opposed to him running a third time? Do you want him when he is 78 to run till he is, I mean after he's 82 to run again, when you said Biden couldn't? Where are you? We need you on the record. What will you do to stop it?"" And I think that really it's really important, this idea that Trump in the White House believes that he can control elections down to the local level. It's a big threat. And I think that has to be articulated to voters. I think it's so interesting about third term because I'd say the conventional view been to dismiss it, as you said, it's like Trump being Trump. I think you're right. Both A, one shouldn't dismiss it in reality because it's not like, gee, the guy didn't try to stay in office before when there was constitutional and legal prohibitions against it."
pRfQTDMRuyG,6647,Jack Goldsmith,"I know this a little bit because I was following things quite closely at that point in 2008-9. And the military bureaucracy didn't like the people who were doing counter-insurgency and Petraeus's kind of proteges who were part of the surge. Gates thought that was fresh thinking and I think intervened to actually get a couple of people. He didn't do it himself. He had a second, I can't remember, second panel or got different military officers, different general officers to be on the next panel and various people got promoted and so forth. So that's one thing if Bob Gates thinks that's a wise thing to do. I do think, again, getting too much into personalities, it's another thing if some 44-year-old who's never had a senior position in the Pentagon, or is a national security expert or a three-term member of Congress, Tulsi Gabbard, who's not exactly... I hope it works out, trust me, for the country, but the balance of expectation changes a little in terms of how wise they will be in doing it. But it's an interesting question whether it will even work. It's not easy to reform these organizations. The contrast with Rumsfeld's important. I mean, he knew what he was doing. He knew where the dead bodies were. He knew what the channels of communication were."
L_ZQE89NOdE,7996,A.B. Stoddard,"Because Trump does not actually want, presumably... In a certain way he wants, I don't know, does he want a crisis? I mean, it's true if we have a huge crisis in default and the market's down 2000 points in one day, I suppose Trump says this is, see, what I warned you about. It never happened when I was president. This is Biden. I mean, I don't know. Trump could sort of win either way. Or if it doesn't happen, he'll attack the Republicans for selling out on the Hill, which the base will like, and there'll be no consequences. I don't know. Maybe we're being too... I'm glad you weren't so you weren't watching CNN , Bill. But when he said, ""I think this time we have to do a default."" She played him tape of him in office at the resolute desk saying, ""We cannot toy with this concept, and it's far too dangerous, and it's not even remotely on the table."" Or something like that. And she said, ""Why'd you say that then?"" And he said, ""Because I was president then."" Yeah. That's amazing, isn't it? Like he was enjoying the fact that, if he could tank the economy and on Biden's watch, that it's no sweat off his. So it was one of the low moments of the night, and there were many."
uepIxY_Tkp0,7715,Mark Esper,"It's not a good- Iran, Iran, Iran. We have a far better team, and so we have to keep them together. We have to train with them, make sure that they're interoperable. And of course, I served for a few years in Europe as Army officer in NATO. So I appreciate the alliance from that perspective. But look, I was also willing to be critical and still am about our NATO allies not spending enough on defense and not doing more to make sure that they're combat ready. Because if you're truly combat ready effective, there's no greater deterrent than to have that capability. I guess Iran would be the other country that's part of the Alliance League. Yeah, absolutely. And pretty important it turns out in terms of what they can provide in the drones and stuff. Yeah, no, it's really evolved, accelerated over the past couple of years. They're subordinate, but not like a third tier player here that maybe Mali or Nicaragua is, or Cuba. I mean, they really have become an industrial base, at least for Russia, in terms of providing drones and missiles and items like that. We know North Korea is doing the same. So we're seeing a degree of cooperation between these countries that we've never seen before, and we should be concerned about that."
rO7JScyuLyB,2343,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"So if 5,000 people from China cross the border, it doesn't matter what the policy on the ground actually says. In immigration, presence is nine-tenths of the law. You are now on US soil. If the United States wants to deport you, then it is going to have find a country that is willing to take you. And if no country is willing to take you, then there are just limits to what the United States can do. This is not new, of course. This was the case for Cubans for 50 years. Wet foot, dry foot, the policy that was in effect from the Clinton administration through the last days of Obama was essentially an acknowledgement that there was little the United States could do once a Cuban got onto US soil. Cuba would not take people who made it onto US soil. And therefore, since the United States couldn't find too many other countries in the hemisphere that would take Cubans, we just decided it was much easier to let them stay. Yeah, the practical side of immigration-I was struck by this is I've learned a little more over the last year-so much more complicated than the slogans and even the actual laws on paper because so much of it's about what can happen and what can be done administratively and what other countries wish to do."
aomm3sLBzQl,5961,Aaron Friedberg,"And my own view is that's not an accurate presentation, and it's not solely or primarily because of any failings of the current administration. It's because of the way these other powers are evolving. And I believe I said this in one of our prior conversations that Biden had an opportunity, there was a moment there after the start of the Ukraine war, after the beginning of the Russian invasion, when he could conceivably have gone to Congress and said, as Truman did after the North Korean invasion of the South in June, 1950, ""This is an extremely dangerous, a newly dangerous situation, and we have enemies and so on, and therefore we need to make dramatic increases in the resources that we devote to defense among other things over an extended period of time."" And I think he probably would've gotten support for that from people on both sides of the aisle. Now, they did wind up increasing the amounts of money that they're spending, but they have not made what I would consider to be the necessary long-term, upward adjustments in the slope of that curve. And it's kind of late to do that. It requires... because we're in a different situation... It's not like during the Cold War where, again, I think people had a general sense of what the problem was."
ywayIxY8Nq5,8707,James Carville,"Because I got news for you, birth control is popular out there. Those pills, the people like them. And you got to drive it home. You got to keep them answering. You got to keep Trump off guard. You can do it with things like this. You can't let him get his footing. I just don't see him being a sufficient irritant out there. But then they have a big financial advantage. They could open up some opportunities here over the summer. Yeah, I mean, I think people's views settle in and I think this notion that you wait until September strikes me as very risky. You have the conventions in July and August. Those things are kind of shows, but they don't really change, I don't think people's minds. So you really... June feels to me like a big month to make progress both with paid advertising and with earned media messaging, and then if there's a debate at the end. And if there's not a debate, I guess Biden at least gets to beat up Trump for ducking out, right? Well, yeah. The other thing is, one of the things that we've seen over our careers is the erosion of the convention bounce. I remember when Dukakis actually went ahead of Bush after the convention. Didn't stay ahead obviously, but even Mondale gained a lot of ground on Reagan post-convention."
NPkON_ZZhZt,15021,Anne Applebaum,"There's certain wishful thinking here after three months, four months, Elon Musk goes away, DOGE, okay, we've seen the worst of it. It's going to slow down sort of reversion to the mean. It wasn't crazy to hope that, I suppose, but it feels to me like it's more like the opposite. Anyway, how does it look to you? I am not surprised that they are trying it or that they are accelerating. Everything they are doing is stuff they said they would do. I mean, DOGE had some little twists I didn't expect. I didn't know you could send a guy into a US government department and switch off the computers. I mean, I hadn't thought of that, but that's a kind of high-tech version of it. But I expected most of this to happen. I think for me, the surprise has been the number of people, the Republicans in the Senate and the House, but also law firms, business, even ordinary people. The surprise for me has been how many people gave up before fighting and they just kind of acquiesced. And I think, by the way, that's a surprise for Europeans too. I mean, everybody has this image of Americans. We believe in freedom and we're cowboys and we fight for what we believe and so on."
tK9R8vXx-8R,5927,Aaron Friedberg,"I was talking to someone actually earlier today about this. I was consistent with what I just said, maybe the better critique of Trump for the American public is a little less the America First thing, or even the tariffs, though I think that probably has some potency, or the explaining the knock-on effects of deserting Ukraine, which I do think people have a sense of, so I think that's all important. But also just the pure riskiness of his being so erratic and impulsive and not understanding that you need to have a functioning foreign policy and a functioning administration that carries out a policy somewhat consistently and so forth. And I was wondering if you think in your reading of American history since World War II, I guess, does the charge that someone who wants to be president, Trump's a little different who wants to be president again, but it's too risky? Does that work politically? I mean, is that something that Harris should be saying or is it better to stay on the particulars of the terrorists and Ukraine and so forth? I kind of have the feeling that there's something that people could see there. They kind of have a common sense view I take it that you can't run major organizations this way, can't run the government this way."
AW7NLoX2KFu,20232,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
FAyKnasb0SU,6810,Tim Snyder,"And that basically got laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay and they were going to fight. I didn't think they would do as well as they ended up doing. So here I'm going to join in your expectation. I want to start there somewhere else, which is why, I'm just going to pose it a different way, which is why didn't we take Ukraine seriously or to put it in the sharpest possible term, why was our expectation the same as Russia's expectation? Because both inside the Kremlin and inside the Beltway and inside the Beltway among both Republicans and Democrats, the expectation was Ukraine is going to fold in a few days. And why did we have that expectation? And I think that expectation arises from the deep fundamentals, the imponderabilia, the things that come before we even start talking about history or strategy or politics. I think that comes from a kind of very deep Russian subjective victory, which is Americans and most people in the West until 2022, somewhere deep down thought Russia's a real place and Ukraine is not a real place. And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud."
CAyOBV96z-m,7016,Robert Kagan,"This was the argument against you to kind go, to use your argument against this mild moment of optimism, sudden unusual moment of mild optimism here, it would be to say, ""Well, but anti- liberalism can also appeal to elements of these minorities,"" as you just said, the Italians, the Irish, the Catholics. I don't know, other people can say, ""I'm here, but I don't want this America with these other people,"" or, ""I don't want these different customs of these other people."" So the anti-liberalism can find new recruits maybe, that would be the kind of modification of your argument, I suppose. No, that's certainly true, and I don't want to get too optimistic about anything. I just want to put you back to earth here. No, no. But this gets to the important point, and again, you don't know how it's going to play out. It is pretty clear. This is something that, again, this gets back to the major point which Jefferson warned about, which Lincoln was talking about in his Lyceum speech in 1838, which is that it is possible for Americans to lose their sense of the critical importance of the founding principles. Right. Lincoln was worried that people had it during the revolution, but lost it afterwards. Jefferson was worried that they would in fact lose it after the revolution was over."
AA3yxIHOxZJ,5122,Tom Tugendhat,"They've got a lot of other things to worry about, though they've behaved quite well in this crisis. They haven't really articulated what you just articulated. And in fact, on some issues, because of politics and other things, they haven't been as forward-leading, I would say, on trade at all. They haven't removed most of Trump's trade tariffs, even on Europe, I don't think, right? Kind of crazy that we have tariffs against our allies who are all trying to help Ukraine and same in some other areas of immigration and so forth. So, I think articulating the kind of vision you just did is not something that President Biden has particularly done, as sort of unlike Truman and Acheson, I suppose, and Marshall famously, but- Your father was not in any way anti-American, but his anti-protectionism was indeed a form of America First. He wouldn't have put it that way because of the loaded context to those words, of course, but it's a pro-Americanism. And you know, I represent a community in West Kent, right? I represent about 80,000 electors, about 100,000 souls who vote left, right, whatever, for the advantage of Kent, the United Kingdom, and their family across the world. And the reason that I am an advocate for this level of cooperation is quite literally because I think it is fundamentally in the interest of the British people, you know?"
yrF4jLVDnPK,9099,James Carville,"What now though? As you say, LaCivita and Susie, Wiles and Fabrizio know what they're doing. They're presumably trying to adjust. Maybe Trump can adjust. I don't know. What do you think? How much has Trump sort of genuinely seem to have lost it a little bit? Not to give advice to the Trump campaign, but what should the Harris campaign be preparing for the Trump campaign to do? Because I think it would be also overconfident to assume they're going to be rattled for three months here, right? The first thing you anticipate is obvious. They're going to put 2019 front and center. It's pretty clear. I mean, they'll get around to it, but they'll eventually get there. So I think, I hope this is going on. I have some reason to think it's a little bit more than a hope. Trump is like a guy with an act that worked brilliantly and then all of a sudden it didn't work as well. And you keep trying harder. You tell the same jokes and you tell them a little bit louder, you're a little more emphasis, but they don't have the same punch. And when you watch him, that rally in Georgia I think is significant because he didn't fill it up and he blamed Georgia State- a well-known liberal, coastal, elite institution."
aynAV-AMI11,4046,Eric Edelman,"The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria. We had put in place an enormous number of sanctions on individuals and entities in Syria as a result of the very destructive 15 year long Syrian Civil War, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, created a massive outflow of refugees from Syria and internally displaced people in Syria. And this was done, the president said quite openly, essentially at the behest of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and President Erdoğan of Turkey, both of whom have an understandable desire to see Syria stabilized after 15 years of violence that have wracked the country and disrupted the region. That's all understandable. And there is an argument that sanctions on Syria should be lifted, or at least some sanctions should be lifted. The question though is, first of all, this was done without any kind of deliberative policy process at all. In fact, the administration's counter-terrorism coordinator and Deputy National Security Advisor, Seb Gorka, just on the end of the day before the president left, was fulminating about, ""We're not going to lift sanctions on this jihadi president of Syria."" And there is a question about al-Sharaa because he does have a past link to jihad."
Vmu3Z_JbkhG,7253,Robert Kagan,"Jamie Dimon said Trump was right about immigration. So that's the other scary thing, is that he can start sort of abusing his powers in a way that a lot of Americans will find acceptable. I think that Jamie Dimon comment, he's the head of, what is it? The head of Citibank? JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan. I can't keep any of these. Chase, all those oligarchic corporate institutions, they're all a blur to me. It's one thing for them to say, ""We like the economic policies."" Okay, we understand that rich guys like economic policy that help the rich, and they have arguments for why it's good ultimately and blah, blah, blah, and corporate America and all this. The fact that he's mentioned immigration is very striking. Jamie Dimon, what is his problem with more immigration? I mean, I don't believe there's any way in which, as a corporate matter, they are hurt by having higher immigration. There are some businesses I guess that would benefit from restrictionist immigration policies. I don't quite know why, but there would be some, I suppose. I haven't really thought that through. But banks don't care, and probably hire a lot of people who are pretty recent immigrants for some of their jobs and so forth. Of course, it's a global company and it's not nativist in that simple-minded sense of we want to protect America."
D-oVGenh53r,7709,A.B. Stoddard,"Because the base is so attached to him that they'll forgive a little bit of heterodoxy. So I guess what I'm struck by, and I want you to talk about this, but he's just a better demagogue as of now than DeSantis. Demagogues have to sort of look like they believe what they're saying. And in America, I think they have to look like they enjoy what they're saying. Not just demagogues, but politicians. McCain, Obama, Bush. We tend to nominate somewhat cheerful people. And Trump, in his own kind of bizarre way, is somewhat cheerful, but also he's a mainstream demagogue. I mean, what's wrong with Biden? He's going to start World War III because God knows what he's doing in foreign policy. I'm tough, so they won't mess with me, and he doesn't really understand the economy. And I'm a businessman, and we had a decent economy when I was president, so I understand the economy. So that's not actually that ideological. I mean, it's sort of substance- less, but if you're a middle-class business person who doesn't really like Trump and sort of worried about him, you hear that and you think, yeah, that's a reasonable appeal. And, meanwhile, DeSantis is talking about Disney. I really think Trump is in a better demagogic lane than DeSantis as of now."
97VksQNzNpJ,6529,Aaron Friedberg,"I haven't read the full transcript of his encounter with Zelensky, but people are pointing to this or some people are pointing to this, ""Well, they met and it was very cordial, and how can you say that Trump would be hostile to Ukraine?"" But if you read at least the portions of the transcript I saw, the reason he likes Zelensky now, he says, is Zelensky really could have stuck it to him during the first impeachment investigation by saying that he felt pressured. But instead, he said that he didn't, and therefore he helped Trump. Well, of course, you think about it, and Zelensky's position at the time, is he going to inject himself into this controversy and say, ""Yes, Trump was twisting my arm,"" with the possibility that Trump would in fact not be impeached as happened and then would wreak vengeance on him? So as with everything with Trump, his judgment on this person and this issue is almost entirely personal. So short answer to your question is yes, there would be a lot of difference. And judging by what Trump has said, and even more what Vance has said, I think there's every reason to believe that a new Trump administration would at a minimum put enormous pressure on the Ukrainians to come to terms to, and Trump has said this, to accept it's very sad they lost some of their territory, but really they can never get it back and they need to just accept that."
a-_oep79KN2,3378,Doug Sosnik,"And over the long term, I think third party candidates can be much more viable, because when you think about all institutions that the young people have dismissed and no longer believe in, and now we put the political parties right at the top of that list. But getting back in real time to now, back to your question, I think one thing that's different for a lot of people is, I think people learned a lesson, Democrats learned a lesson in 2016 that when you don't vote, or you vote for a third party or fourth party or fifth party, it's not free, and there are real political implications or policy implications by a protest vote and all that. That's not to say that in February, March, April, and May or June that people aren't going to maybe support third and fourth parties, fifth parties, but I do think for some people the 2016 experience will ultimately impact when they have to get to a decision point, as most of the time you look at the history of third party candidacies, the numbers go down as you get closer to the election, but eight, nine months out, two candidates you don't like, I mean, why not as a proxy say you're for a third and fourth party? And I think particularly for Democrats, the third party option is also a reflection that they could have the satisfaction enough, while they don't go out and vote third or fourth or fifth party, they just may not vote."
xXvwvX5Fh47,17341,Anne Applebaum,"And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia? And we have analyzed this many times back and forth, and we've heard all the possible explanations, and none of them has ever really made any sense. I mean, none of it really adds up. As for Europeans, the first part of your question... So yes, Europe now-actually this has been true for a while, this has been true for more than a year-Europe in total gives more money to Ukraine than the United States does. And that's both money... Ukrainians now have their own industries. And so Europe funds a lot of the drone production, for example, inside Ukraine, or some of it takes place outside of Ukraine in neighboring countries. So, the European money, both producing weapons and giving them weapons, is now much larger than the US. Plus there's other kinds of economic support and so on. I think European, there was a kind of Czech-led project to collect ammunition from around the world, that's had an impact. And so there's no question that Europe is now the more important source of aid, military aid and economic aid for Ukraine than the United States."
2_V-R1zBlP3,3861,Doug Sosnik,"I mean, the degree to which it is based around one person, Trump, but then by now it's got a pretty big associated bunch of not just issues but attitudes, and stances towards institutions and towards the past, and repudiation of the recent past of that party in a really dramatic way, right? I mean, the Trump people hate the Bush and McCain and [inaudible] people more than they hate Democrats, to some degree. I don't know. It's to say a little bit about these two parties, right? Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I don't quite know how that all works out, but... You're absolutely right, and they are completely in different places. And if you take Yogi Berra's old saying, ""If there's a fork in the road, take it."" The Republicans have taken their fork in the road, and they're now more of a working class party, more of a nationalist party, more of a MAGA party. They are. And so in a sense they're, it's kind of a narrow base of support, but quite deep. I think on the Democratic side, back to the Yogi Berra quote, they haven't taken the fork in the road, and, in fact, this is something I've written on and I haven't published it yet, there's going to be an enormous reckoning for the Democratic Party that's going to happen the day after the election, regardless of whether Trump is elected or not."
9d_jHVH4K32,7192,Jack Goldsmith,"So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter. And so, again, one can be optimistic or pessimistic about what they're going to do. And I suppose whether it's one as optimistic or pessimistic is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah, Trump was amazing on just this past Sunday to ""Meet the Press."" He had, I'd say, half the time, was being pretty careful to, ""I'm not going to order anyone to do anything. It's their call."" On other issues too, mass deportations, while the Dreamers. ""Well, we try to work that out with Democrats."" And then, the other half of the time, it was, ""Well, Liz Cheney deserves to be in jail."" Right. And that, I found a little astonishing from the president elect to say about a member or former members of Congress, all the members of that committee deserve to go to prison. And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime."
mNqk6_R7iYO,5170,Larry Summers,"Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I'm very pleased to be joined again actually for the fourth time on this series of conversations by Larry Summers, the very distinguished economist, a Harvard University professor, former Secretary of the Treasury, former director of the National Economic Council. Larry, we haven't done this for a few years. You remember that in February 2021, we had our last conversation. And you very early warned that you were worried about inflation being much higher than people expected. And from a political point of view, doing more damage to the Biden presidency than expected. So that was prescient. Anyway, thank you for joining me again. I don't mean to remind people of- Good to be with you and good to have one of the accurate predictions I made remembered. It's not that 100% of them have been accurate over time. Well, whose are, especially in this day and age? I was very struck by... I want to talk about the current economic moment and especially about your alarm about it, if I could put it that way. You've seen an awful lot of things come and go. You've seen a lot of presidents make policy mistakes and we pay a price for those mistakes, but that price is whatever it is, point something percent of GDP or something else."
_F4t-6_OSPs,7643,Robert Kagan,"But this is massive influx of immigration from the late 19th century into the early 20th century. And the pressure to cut that off begins pretty early. Wilson has to fend off numerous efforts by Congress to cut off immigration, but ultimately the success comes in the 1920s. And the 1924 Immigration Act is the most restrictive immigration act in American history. And it very specifically not only focuses on only allowing white people in, but only a certain kind of white people, which, in the 1920s, one of the wonderful features of that period was the widespread popularity of eugenics. This is something that, I feel like we have swept this completely under the rug. It wasn't just that you had some crazy racists running around. It's that in the university, the leading academics in the young field of anthropology and elsewhere were dividing up the white race into Nordics and Alpines and Mediterranean, and were proving that the Nordic peoples were smarter than the Mediterranean people, et cetera. Sam Huntington, the great Sam Huntington's father was the president of the American Eugenics Society for a while. So this is a time of hyper-consciousness about race and a real desire to limit the American population as much as possible to the original, basically Anglo-Saxon, Protestant that was the majority when the country was founded, to the point where the Ku Klux Klan has... what the people call the Second Ku Klux Klan has got millions of supporters."
ruSZzFFERq8,8014,Larry Summers,"I guess that's my... I really have come to this a hundred-day stuff. We're speaking here on, what is it, April 28th and it's almost a hundred days of the year, and it was a hundred days. That's a really a long time. A hundred days is one-fifteenth, I haven't done the math precisely of an administration's longevity. And if we're at this level of instability and uncertainty at one- fifteenth, could get better, but it could also just at least stay as bad or could get worse. If JD Vance were ever to ascend to the presidency. It is hard to imagine him saying that our long national nightmare is over as he ascended, and that is a very substantial difference. Richard Nixon, for all his many faults, knew the difference between right and wrong well enough to do his best to obscure all the wrong that he was doing. Donald Trump glories in the wrong that he's doing and wants it to be as public as possible so as to deter, intimidate, and cast a shadow over potential opposition. That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that."
c12zmpCERTq,8056,James Carville,"And the president's campaign, I think that economic message is, ""things are better than you think they are,"" which if left alone, maybe some pea shoots of hope, some consumer confidence numbers might look a little bit better, but you've got to let people come to that conclusion because if you come to that conclusion for them and they don't think it's a good economy, they say, ""Well, how can this guy fix something that he doesn't even think is broke?"" every conversation that everyone has in every focus group about President Biden begins with age, in the middle it's age, and at the end it's age, and that's a real fact that they have to live with, and they've just got to plow through it. And getting mad at The New York Times for talking about his age is not going to work. Presumably, one way to follow through it is to have a forward-looking agenda, as you were saying. I do feel like that's- Yes. It would be nice if he came out with three or four things he will hit with his second term to give at least something other than, ""You should be happy with what you got."" The messages from Biden should be, ""You should be happy with what you got,"" and from Trump is, ""You should be happy with what you had,"" but there's no message in there that says, ""You're going to be happy with what you're going to see."" And it's ripe, and he could do that, he could say, ""We have unfinished work."
kgYEDLHbPPL,6196,Aaron Friedberg,"The Hezbollah situation was a standoff. It is a good lesson in how the post-October 7th Middle East feels like it's not found to new equilibrium and probably won't for a while. No, I think that's right. We don't know where any of the dimensions of this are going to go. I suppose there is a possibility that Israel could escalate further against Iran or if there's some kind of direct exchange. The next step up the ladder, it seems to me, would be for Israel to take action against Iran's nuclear program. But they haven't shown any inclination to do that. So yeah, this is, I think, the best possible outcome, at least of this most recent exchange with Hezbollah from an Israeli point of view, is that they buy themselves time. I don't think anyone believes that Hezbollah is going to collapse and go away, or that Nasrallah is not going to be replaced by somebody. So this is going to be ongoing. But as has happened in the past, going back to 2006, the last time they had a real war directly with Hezbollah, it was fought to a standstill, but it also led to an extended period of more or less quiet. And I suppose that's what the Israelis are hoping for. It's also striking to me just one more second on the Middle East that Israel hits Yemen, it's a take because the Houthis had launched, I guess, missiles at Israel..."
bzrGUxALS83,6016,Tim Snyder,"I think that's an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, ""These guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,"" which of course fascists are. Fascists have the cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness. And in that way, Milošević really was... he was somebody who talked about both... he does the thing which Putin does now and which Trump does now, which is that you somehow are both always the victim and you're always the victor at the same time. Like everybody's always against you and somehow it always turns out well, and whatever you do is okay because you're always already the victim. But yeah, I don't think, in coming out of the '80s into the '90s, a lot of the people that the United States had backed during the Cold War would have been called, if we had not been backing them, fascists. And so that's one reason why we're not sensitive to it. But I think the main reason we're not sensitive to it actually is a lack of reflection about our own history. I think that's really where we... that's our real problem. It's not anybody else, the problem is us. Yeah. And certainly someone like me who'd been on the conservative side, I feel like I've personally learned a ton about... and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and everything."
6xXMyFeUjlI,9776,James Carville,"I mean, we just forget how bad that was. A I don't blame people. Who wants to remember? I hated the God damn thing. But I think every little word is going to count in this, and I think recovery is one of those words that can help him. James, thank you for this conversation. Thank you for all this good advice to president and his team. Thank you all for all the fricking work you're doing. Tim liked my last video. He told me, ""Play it on the show."" That's good. That's good. But we'll get together after the debate, or the non-debate, on June 27th and do an analysis of how the whole thing's been turned around by your council to the president. And it's a good start to the day in the Pacific time zone. Thank you, James. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations."
yEXocN_SqJe,15316,Anne Applebaum,"But there's been absolutely nothing there. But the business, and I guess it has been for me, just seeing it time and time again, and people would say, ""Well, Bill, when he really goes after the stuff that effects business directly, that's when they'll step up. You can't expect them to be quite as concerned as you are about abstract issues of, I don't know, academic freedom or other kinds of assaults on civil liberties or the fact that he's going after his enemies. That was some particular cases, people who went after him in his first term or after. But come on, when it gets serious."" Tariffs, they all just decided basically, we're going to go cut deals instead of taking any kind of stand on principle. And now of course, we're taking over parts of companies and then becoming supplicants to him, the corruption, the crypto stuff is really beyond belief. And now we just... We're speaking, what is it, August 27. So Wednesday at the end of August, he's going after the Fed. And that was supposed to be the red line that they couldn't tolerate. I don't see a lot of... I mean, you can understand because running actually Citibank right now, maybe you can't think, you can't afford to take on Trump. That's itself a statement about capitalism and its limitations and supporting freedom, I would say."
9PJJga_tc4m,3780,David Axelrod,"But this is a real thing, and Biden's not getting the credit for what he has done. He's getting the blame for more than he should, but it is the lot of being President of the United States at a time of war. Yeah, this is the incumbent... Sarah finds it, [inaudible] finds this a lot in the focus groups. The world seems chaotic, and Biden doesn't seem to be on top of this now. Yeah, that's what I said at the beginning. That's a Republican message. It's a little unfair. I mean, the world could be chaotic. It's not Joe Biden's fault that Putin invaded Ukraine and this horrible war that's going on. No, this is a way of saying... The Republican message is he's too old and feeble. Now, I mentioned the other day that they're more than willing to give him credit, Trump is, for masterminding a vast conspiracy involving the Justice Department and prosecutors across the country to persecute Trump. So he can mastermind this whole elaborate conspiracy, but he can't tie his own shoes. It's like, choose a horse and ride it, brother. Conspiracy theories do not have to be consistent. This is something we know from history, right? The Jews in charge of everything and they're weak. I mean, it's- Yes. Yeah. No, you're right."
p1WZQuiVg9l,2632,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"There are many people who have been deported at some point in the last 30 years, and then re-entered and are in the country with a prior order of removal on their record. These are the people that can be deported very quickly because all they have to do from an administrative perspective is they do what's known as reinstating the order of removal. That's a process that takes maybe a couple of hours and you can pick somebody up at the border. The border patrol in that circumstance in Bakersfield, if one of those 78 people had prior removal order, they could pick that person... That person may already be deported because the prior removal order can be reinstated so quickly. I mean, to be simple-minded about it, how many of those 78 are likely to be in that kind of situation? We're talking a relatively small percentage. We don't know, but it's probably higher than the average undocumented population because if this was a targeted operation, they picked and chose their targets based on the highest impact. So in these sort of targeted operations, generally they do go after people with criminal records. That is their highest priority. They do go after people with the most serious records first, which is part of the reason why the Laken Riley Act is a concern because you would essentially prioritize people with shoplifting arrests over that."
B-z2Gm2hO5v,3933,Doug Sosnik,"But there are a couple of additional groups of voters that I think are going to be important to watch in this election because they're both so unpopular. One is third party candidates. We saw that they made the difference in 2016, which is the last time you had two very unpopular nominees. And I think about 18% of the people who voted in 2016 disliked both candidates and Trump carried them by 17 points. So one is third parties and what kind of impact they can have. If you go back to Michigan, I think there were 175,000 third party votes in '16 in a state that Trump carried by a little bit more than 10,000 votes. And the vast majority of those people who voted third, fourth, fifth party would've voted for Hillary in a two person race. And you saw in 22,000 in Florida, where, I think, 95,000 people voted for Ralph Nader in an election that Bush won by less than 400 votes. So because the uniqueness of both of these candidates being unpopular, one is the third party impact and then the second are what I call double haters, the people that dislike both candidates, and as I mentioned a minute ago, they were decisive in 2016. So I think that's going to be a key group of swing voters in 2024."
s5Ft3jHJzuU,2393,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"We also know- Just to get clear, so if you show up legally at a port of entry and say, ""I want asylum,"" you fill out documents and so forth, and then you're okay for a year in the US until a trial or until appointment with an administrative judge or something like that? Yeah. So actually, right now, if you show up to a port of entry, you get turned away completely. You actually cannot simply go up to a port of entry and say, ""I want to seek asylum."" You have to register through an online process, share all of your information. You take a picture of your face so they can run you through facial recognition databases and sort of enter all of your information in this, and then you go into a literal lottery system. Right now, average wait times are about eight or nine months. Once you get your appointment, after however long it's taken you to win this appointment lottery, then you go to a port of entry and you show up there. Then they take your fingerprints, they run you through a number of databases again, and under the CBP One process, you are then given one year of humanitarian parole. That lets you get a work permit so you can get on your feet more quickly."
a-L5H6Q16H7,5453,Larry Summers,"And it may be that there are people who are holding their participation because the fire has to burn itself out a bit. They may be making those judgments in prudent and sound ways. But it may also be that there is some collective action problem around courage. I was encouraged to see reports over the weekend of collaboration among leading universities to mount a united front. And I thought that perhaps the Business Roundtable could learn from those reports. I found it striking and disappointing that the legal profession at the highest levels of the two dozen leading firms in the United States doesn't seem to have been able to come together to stand for the rule of law and to stand with firms that are being bullied in what are surely Constitutionally outrageous ways, out of taking on certain kinds of clients. So I think that a lot will depend upon the kinds of pressures that are brought to bear for reversal, and markets are one such source of pressure. And they have the virtue that they are collective, they have the virtue that participation in them is largely anonymous. People all sell and nobody quite knows who it is exactly who is selling. And they have the virtue that they're always open, and so they're sending signals in very rapid response to events."
BrOn58Cqaba,8848,Mark Esper,"My red lines were the four no's, and my strategy was to play defense on the outside and offense on the inside. So offense on the inside meant within DOD, within the Pentagon, I wanted to keep forward moving all the initiatives I had underway to modernize the military, to focus on China, to improve the lives of our service members, go as hard as I could, play offense for the next six or seven months, but outside the Pentagon, be in a far more defensive stance, be far more calibrated to people trying to use DOD for political reasons, and so that became my strategy. And then my goal eventually became, got to get to the election, get to the election, and let the American people make the choice. And whatever happens after that, I didn't think I would be able to hold on any longer. And I was largely correct in that estimation. I think you wrote your resignation letter before the president tweeted that you were going to be removed, right? Well, I did have the outlines of one, but my view was, and it was actually tempered by folks, I talked a lot with Bob Gates and Leon Panetta and other predecessors, Colin Powell and at these very difficult times in the summer of 2020, because you want to get advice from people who were in those positions, who held those jobs, who can give you the best recommendations because they've been there, but also have the advantage of being from the outside looking in."
TVsDLmZ9jYH,5640,Jack Goldsmith,"I didn't have a big role in intersecting with the intelligence committees when I was at OLC, but they play a role. And listen, the intelligence community and the executive branch realizes that it has to keep its committees happy. It has a statutory duty to keep them informed and the intelligence committees can cause all sorts of problems. It's been going on. I mean, all sorts of problems if they get a bee in their bonnet about something. And same thing in the Armed Services side, there's an ongoing every day relationship. I mean, really intimate with staffers talking to people [inaudible]. Less so, don't you think on judiciary, less so? I do. I do. I think it's much less... My sense is- Seems more like a food fight between Jim Jordan and whatever. That's my sense. That's my sense. I'm not an expert on that. But you asked me about... I mean, we were talking about intelligence and defense. Again, I don't want to romanticize it, but there has been serious Congressional oversight. I'm not saying it's been adequate, but it's been non-trivial. And from both, including their own party to some degree. Yeah. Yes. The Republicans and Democrats don't always agree, especially on the intelligence committees. There's more of a divide there in my sense than on the Armed Services committees, but I think they still have pretty good relationships across the aisle there even when they disagree."
qeJ4M5PKHEw,8881,James Carville,"And the press pays too little attention to Rod because he's very there on that kind of nationalistic... He lives in Hungary now, [inaudible] about. But Rod is very, as you know in that world, because you had to deal with it more than most people had to deal with, he's really, really influential. And that's a lot of that kind of thinking that you would have some basically three-child policy. Yeah, I agree. And the religious nationalist stuff and the intolerance and the mean-spiritedness. I just felt like all that... Trump gets away with a ton because as you said earlier, it's a shtick and people kind of assume, he doesn't quite believe a lot of it and he's irresponsible and all that. But Vance, it's like DeSantis, right? I mean, it's sort of, you get the unattractive side of Trump without any of the stuff taking the edge off, it feels like to me. And other thing you just know there's more behind that door. You know we're not through. All right. James, you got to go. I got to go. Yes, sir. This has been terrific, very insightful. Hopefully, I assume Vice President Harris will be watching it when we release it tomorrow when she's on the road there with Governor Walz. She has a little time."
hxe5iqmBhue,5961,Larry Summers,"I think it's an extraordinary thing that the number of flights booked by Canadians to come to the United States is down by 70%. You and I, Bill, are used to the idea that going to visit certain countries, prudent people carry burner phones so that their phone will not be downloaded with its content. It is now very common practice for visitors from our Five Eyes allies, not NATO, our closest intelligence sharing allies. People in authority from those countries now don't feel comfortable bringing their regular cell phone to the United States. That is a quite stunning level of deterrence that we are introducing. And so I don't think that gets put back in the bottle. We are seeing precedence set in terms of the wielding of the presidential authority in arbitrary ways that will be followed by future presidents. There's a term in physics that I was involved in importing into economics that I think very much applies here. The term is hysteresis, a physical system which is a ball and a bowl has only one equilibrium. Wherever it starts, the ball rolls to the bottom of the bowl. A ball on a football field has lots of equilibrium. Wherever the ball gets kicked, it stops and it rests. And systems are sometimes subject to a kind of cyclicality."
