LwMtshF6PwK,2882,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head. Based on the Trump administration, if they just get more aggressive on raids or whatever we're supposed to call them, and the targeted actions and if they have the good enough information to know where to target actions and stuff, which maybe they do, I don't know, I mean, what would the plausible number of people... What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people? Hundreds of thousands of people? Tens of thousands for sure, because even the Biden administration has deported tens of thousands of people with criminal records. The previous administration deported every single year. Now, of course, when we say criminal records, I want to emphasize the number one most common offense is traffic offenses of a prior record. The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry."
luYIFdlKdMw,2988,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on. So we could see 2 million people lose their ability to live here legally and to work. That doesn't mean they're going to be deported, however, because when you lose the status, you just kind of become undocumented. So he could render 2 million people fully undocumented as opposed to what they are now, kind of semi-documented. They don't have permanent status, but they do have temporary status. You could just get rid of that and sort of put them in the population of the undocumented and then make efforts to deport them. But they would still too have to go through the immigration court backlogs potentially. And then when it comes to legal immigration, of course he can cut legal immigration much more easily than any of this. It's much easier for the president to stop people from entering the country- Yeah, say a word about that because of course, the famous Muslim ban in the first term was that. It wasn't removing people who were here, or it wasn't stopping people at the border particularly."
UvtaiJVfU7w,8065,Larry Summers,"I guess that's my... I really have come to this a hundred-day stuff. We're speaking here on, what is it, April 28th and it's almost a hundred days of the year, and it was a hundred days. That's a really a long time. A hundred days is one-fifteenth, I haven't done the math precisely of an administration's longevity. And if we're at this level of instability and uncertainty at one- fifteenth, could get better, but it could also just at least stay as bad or could get worse. If JD Vance were ever to ascend to the presidency. It is hard to imagine him saying that our long national nightmare is over as he ascended, and that is a very substantial difference. Richard Nixon, for all his many faults, knew the difference between right and wrong well enough to do his best to obscure all the wrong that he was doing. Donald Trump glories in the wrong that he's doing and wants it to be as public as possible so as to deter, intimidate, and cast a shadow over potential opposition. That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that."
icpHdEoziIb,7317,Larry Summers,"Let me say three things. The secret sauce of economics is arithmetic, so I think it's useful to just think about some numbers. The average tariff rate in the United States before Trump's first term was 1.5%. During his first term with really very considerable excitement, he doubled it from about 1.5% to about 3%. The proposals that he announced on ""Liberation Day"" took 3% to 28%. So it was a tenfold increase. It was 20 times larger almost than what he had done during his first term. There are differences in view about how to interpret precisely where we are or where things might go, but I know of no thoughtful observer who thinks the number's likely to fall below, well, something in the 12 to 15 range. So we are looking at an increment to tariffs five to 10 times conservatively as that which he applied during his first term. So it's a mistake to think of this as a respite from anything other than insanity. From the perspective of what people expected even on election day, on knowing that Donald Trump had been elected, what today is regarded as an optimistic scenario is a high tariff scenario. So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place."
BOirOl3U6Ah,19959,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
WNmZTvUAp-C,19375,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
HeKK-IQQ8Vh,6185,Tim Snyder,"I think that's an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, ""These guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,"" which of course fascists are. Fascists have the cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness. And in that way, Milošević really was... he was somebody who talked about both... he does the thing which Putin does now and which Trump does now, which is that you somehow are both always the victim and you're always the victor at the same time. Like everybody's always against you and somehow it always turns out well, and whatever you do is okay because you're always already the victim. But yeah, I don't think, in coming out of the '80s into the '90s, a lot of the people that the United States had backed during the Cold War would have been called, if we had not been backing them, fascists. And so that's one reason why we're not sensitive to it. But I think the main reason we're not sensitive to it actually is a lack of reflection about our own history. I think that's really where we... that's our real problem. It's not anybody else, the problem is us. Yeah. And certainly someone like me who'd been on the conservative side, I feel like I've personally learned a ton about... and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and everything."
2bZnzv45Pfc,6132,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. ""We're on the right side of civil rights and we've..."" yeah. If we fix it, it's all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately. But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is connected to the America First stuff. Lindbergh's... The reason why Lindbergh likes the Nazis is that he wants to have, and I'm paraphrasing him now, but he wants to have a fortress of white people that are going to hold back the black and brown people. His fantasy is that we have a technological advantage across the Atlantic and, together with the Germans, we can basically keep the brown and the black people out of our countries. That's it. And it's direct organic. And you see that direct organic connection too, the folks now who talk about America First or isolationism very often bleed into or are quite openly on the wrong side when it comes to race. And then just as a footnote, it helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don't get. And I think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time around."
cAJHdIEqJej,10659,Mark Esper,"It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades. It's really about China and it's about China, Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese naval vessels in Japanese waters, in Japanese exclusive economic zones, sailing around the Senkakus, which I think the Japanese recognizes. And by the way, it's not just them who are saying fund Ukraine, it's Taiwan too is saying, because they recognize the common principle at stake here. And the common principle is this, if a big authoritarian neighbor invades a smaller democracy for the sole purpose of seizing that territory and incorporating it into their own domain, we need to fight for those principles or else the global order that we've known that's produced peace and prosperity for the last 75 plus years is going to wither away. And that's not the world we want to live in when we're living under Chinese values and Chinese interests. It'll be a far different world for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Or a world in which Putin could just invade a neighbor and slaughter people and then get away with it, keep a good chunk of the territory or all of it. Yeah."
-bQ8f80YMM3,10416,Mark Esper,"What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think. Right? I mean, I feel it's pretty big I think. Don't you think February 24, 2022 will be like a real, genuine moment in world history? Yeah. Look, I think it crystallized again this notion of a new era of great power competition with Russia and China being the adversaries. And keep in mind, it was just a few weeks before the invasion that Putin and Xi Jinping, the president of China, stood side by side of all places in Beijing at the Olympics, and they issued their 5,000 word statement about their strategic partnership and alliance, and would just be a few weeks later when Russia would invade Ukraine with armored columns and mechanized troops. And it was almost like the Nazi invasion of Poland in 39. I mean, it was just kind of a blitz into Kiev. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability."
GMHzrNfYY5R,7819,Aaron Friedberg,"That seems to me highly unlikely. He's expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything. So that would be the first set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one domain has an effect on others. I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely."
2Xj7fJ4MGBL,6974,Aaron Friedberg,"And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they've been, in my view, for the most part, the right thing to say. Are those now her genuine convictions and are they strong enough to enable her to push back against what I think is coming her way if she wins, which is we need to stabilize relations with China, we need to get a ceasefire because somehow we're going to get a peace settlement in the Middle East. Or I'm not sure exactly where that would come out on Ukraine. That we don't know, but I think the variance there is much narrower than the variance if it's Trump. And the downside, in my view, is much worse and more dramatic on the Trump side than it is on the Harris side. So if she wins, we'll be back to sort of normal debates about policy, foreign policy, defense policy, and I think we can survive that and live with that. If Trump wins, we're in a whole different world. In my view, it's likely to be a much darker one. Oh, that's good if somewhat bracing thing to end on."
HKXIIezPfFK,9282,Robert Kagan,"Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies. Right? Right. And the one thing that... Trump is able to amass a pretty broad coalition precisely because his policies have nothing to do with economics. So he's not threatening, for instance, to take money away from rich people, or even very well-to-do people in general, and give it to a working class movement. He doesn't really offer any economic answer to those in the working class. What he offers to them is revenge. What he offers to them is sympathy and support for what is effectively white anxiety. And whenever you say, ""It's the working class that supports Trump."" It's the white working class that supports Trump. The non-white working class does not support Trump, overwhelmingly in the other direction. And so I just think intellectuals in America are heavily influenced by economic and ultimately Marxist interpretations of how society works. And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that."
1ohaoehyQm6,9386,Robert Kagan,"His first and really only issue in 2011 was the birther conspiracy. And when he comes out on the birther conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. So he summoned them to him immediately, and then he displayed all the characteristics that such demagogues have always displayed, including his crudeness and... He is a violator of all the norms, and it is precisely because of his violation of all the norms that he has this following because they see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America, that he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large. Yeah, that's good. I mean, the use of extra-legal forces and threats and even some terror, that's not... I mean, these are not the historians I've read much of, but I think labor historians would say that that's happened quite a lot on the management side in the late 19th century, and it wasn't a trivial part of the attempt to keep unions and working men under control. And then as God knows, there's a lot of ethnic violence and so forth."
MJbhQsIfvkU,9951,James Carville,"God, you really don't feel any better than you would if you never had the infected wisdom tooth, but you do feel better now it's gone, just as an example. But I think that people wanted to like her. They were so glad to have a relief and they came in with disposition. And to her credit, just literally everything she's done since... Was it three weeks now? Seems like 300 years? No, I think just two and a half, maybe. Two- It was on a Sunday, [inaudible]. Two weeks and two days, yeah. We're talking Tuesday the 6th, I think. So far, she has done nothing to dampen people's enthusiasm, she hasn't done anything remotely dumb, so I have reason to actually be encouraged. She looks like she's really grown, and people would tell me that. That's one thing I will say is people internally would say, ""James, she's different. She's more confident,"" and not just White House staff people, people that would go in there. Economists, historians, the same people go in and out of the White House. It doesn't matter who's in there. To a person that would all say she's very confident and asks very good questions and seems to be well briefed. I'm happy that she's like this. I'm not totally surprised. You think that there's reasonable hope that that lasts?"
4mBmNRhONTi,10116,James Carville,"But this is more... You can't use a historical benchmark to talk about this because debates have now taken on near legendary status in American politics. Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out. I was thinking about this the other day, and this is not a criticism, I think it's the first ticket in modern times since the modern primary system came into being where both candidates on one ticket, in this case on the Democratic ticket, and neither of them has ever gotten a vote in a Democratic primary for president, that is every race we've all been involved in or watched... In the early days, they only had a few primaries, Humphrey and all that. But still every nominee in both parties had gotten some primary votes, certainly from '72 on. '76 on, let's just say. And mostly had won the primaries. And then the VP nominees had often run and gotten at least some primary votes, especially if they were the losing candidate. Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list."
ah-gGL2jFAq,11088,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
QhU42BOJTEv,10369,James Carville,"They have to be very, very careful how he's deployed and they have to husband him pretty closely. And I can't fault them for that, but yes sir, how are you going to address him? Yeah, that's a good point. But in the meantime, you can use paid media and stuff to really remind people. But the big thing is going to be the jury. If there's a conviction, how those jurors come across is going to have a lot to how much people accept this verdict. Yeah, that's interesting. And if Trump loses it, which he might and attacks the jury, I feel like that's an opportunity also to say he's attacking these Americans who are doing their duty. Right? Right. If these jurors, what I'd give to prepare one of them for Sunday morning TV. First of all, collectively, this jury took 21,250 hours out of their lives. We listened to X... 28,000 words of testimony. We sat there and observed every witness. We conscientiously went through every document, and we could arrive at no other conclusion but this. Boom. Boom. And who the jury is, who they elect foreman, how articulate she or he is. Yeah, it all depends a lot, but how that jury justifies what they did can have a lot of effect on public opinion, and we never really considered politics in this, to be honest with you."
FnuFtafNt0T,3769,Eric Edelman,"The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria. We had put in place an enormous number of sanctions on individuals and entities in Syria as a result of the very destructive 15 year long Syrian Civil War, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, created a massive outflow of refugees from Syria and internally displaced people in Syria. And this was done, the president said quite openly, essentially at the behest of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and President Erdoğan of Turkey, both of whom have an understandable desire to see Syria stabilized after 15 years of violence that have wracked the country and disrupted the region. That's all understandable. And there is an argument that sanctions on Syria should be lifted, or at least some sanctions should be lifted. The question though is, first of all, this was done without any kind of deliberative policy process at all. In fact, the administration's counter-terrorism coordinator and Deputy National Security Advisor, Seb Gorka, just on the end of the day before the president left, was fulminating about, ""We're not going to lift sanctions on this jihadi president of Syria."" And there is a question about al-Sharaa because he does have a past link to jihad."
eUW0DWq0fiU,4336,Eric Edelman,"I mean, his losses have been extraordinary and the rate of advance has been really very slow. I mean, they've been advancing but at a snail's pace and mostly dismounted infantry assaults, very hard for them to make up their losses in equipment and much less in personnel. They have lost, according to British MOD intelligence numbers that were posted earlier this month, something like 967,000 people, of whom about 200,000 have died, been killed in action. They will probably hit the million-casualty mark sometime this month or early June. Those numbers are astronomical and they're not really sustainable. If Putin has to calculate that he is pursuing this with continued US support, continued European support, maybe stepped-up European support, that's one thing. But if he's able to- For Ukraine. For Ukraine, yeah. But if he's got to calculate that it's going to be US supports going away, European support is kind of iffy, then he's going to be stepping up his operations and think he can drive Ukraine ultimately to capitulate, which seems to be his objective. And that I think would be catastrophic not just for Ukraine, but for European security and for NATO and for US leadership in the world. And by the way, the Chinese will be watching. But yes, to your point, I mean this is not a coherent kind of worldview and it's not sustained by any kind of deliberative process."
cZ6sndcDYzq,7837,AB Stoddard,"They were worried about him, but they didn't really go to the mattress on it. And then suddenly now it's like, oh my God, he's our worst fears. I mean, are we sufficiently appreciative of the fact that this lunatic is the secretary of HHS and is not, contrary to what people sort of thought, has not pulled back at all? And I mean, I'm a little freaked out about this. I have sort of secondary family relations, mostly on Susan's side, in medical and research science world. And I actually know some people in that world too from around here and New York, and I mean, this is bad, they think. And they're not hysterics. And incidentally, a lot of them have been critical of NIH... It's a bureaucracy, they don't always fund the right things. They have the usual gripes you have with big government agencies, but the degree of damage that's being done, and maybe voters don't understand if research on Parkinson's gets slowed down or eviscerated because you don't see the effect, exactly. You know what I mean? You don't see the progress that's not made. It's not like social security office being closed, but I really wonder how much that's going to percolate out through sort of Republican-ish voting groups, right? Physicians, executives and pharma companies."
jIjszqDOhWh,7917,AB Stoddard,"And watching Bill Cassidy, a serious man, senator from Louisiana, a doctor, struggle with that vote, knowing that RFK Jr has really promoted quack science and conspiracies for a long time. That he's anti-vaccine... Bill Cassidy's on the fence... was really, you could really see him turning himself into a pretzel and he ends up supporting him and now is going to call him before his committee to talk about all the firings and he's upset and concerned. That was all predictable. RFK Junior is a really troubled guy and really an unstable person who also just spews falsehoods. And so this was not something to take a chance on. All of this was predictable, and it's really quite enraging. Jonathan Rauch, who's a very well-known writer and will be known to people who listen to this, famously posted around 10 days ago that he had a friend who drove two hours for her breast cancer chemotherapy treatments that were part of an NIH trial only to arrive at the location to be told without any phone call or warning that it had been canceled. And there was no future plans for any new protocols or any new treatments for her. And this kind of thing is going to ripple out through people's lives, people who have kids with special needs, people who have diabetes, whatever it is."
wWmzAmka3p7,4062,David Axelrod,"Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months. This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these... These are strategies. This isn't just expressions of outrage on his part, they're strategies, and we need to call them out for what they are. Well, yeah, I've very much thought that, therefore, I don't really like the, ""He's popping off again, it's all instinct with him and anger."" And there's, of course, a lot of that, God knows, but yeah, there are these branding strategies, he's been doing that for 50 years, marketing- Yes. ...and he's unfortunately good at it. I said to someone the other day, I was critical of the Biden campaign, but I was sympathetic, I said, ""It's tough to run against Trump, he's a tough opponent. He's, in his own crazy way, a very skilled politician of a certain type."" And the person looked at me like I was just crazy. ""Trump is not skilled at anything. Trump is a lunatic. Trump is crazy. He can't control himself. He says one stupid thing after another."" But I think that's a mistake among Liberals and Democrats."
44b8VKkqLen,4203,David Axelrod,"Well, even, I recoil from, after this last weekend, everybody's hair was on fire because he, except Jon Stewart, he had a great bit on this last night, because some guy had on his bumper somehttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Biden. ...phonied-up artwork of Biden bound in the back of his truck. And there is so much out there, so many people out there saying, ""Don't give Trump a platform, don't let Trump..."" I have the opposite view, which is I think more of Trump is better out there, because I do think people need to be exposed to... He's crazier now than he was in 2016, and even 2020, although it's hard to compete with telling people to drink or inject bleach to fight... But he's kind of scary crazy, and people need to understand the choice. I can't stand this notion that if we censor him, it'll all be okay. That's not the case. And I think he's profited, actually... I was relieved when he got taken off Twitter, because it was a migraine headache every day and it was provocative. But now, he's micro channeling, to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just... All that said, Bill, that's just an aside, I'm just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don't think, at the end of the day, that the campaign should be based on all of that."
Ff8J61Yx_zf,4102,Doug Sosnik,"Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it. He's not going to be exciting. He doesn't need to be exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something happened for a moment, the big point about '68, though, and what happened after was, they changed the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he'd broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would've won. But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC."
SAN2cW7GfP6,4108,Doug Sosnik,"What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring of '95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching him. And that really struck me, that struck fear with me. And I do worry a little bit that at some point the public is going to shut down on Biden in terms of giving him another look. And he's got two related but different challenges right now. One is to inspire and motivate his base to not only support them, but to turn out. And it's far from a given that that's going to happen. And then the other of course is with the swing voters in the handful of states that'll determine the next president if it's a close election, his numbers with the swing voters are lagging his overall numbers, which are quite bad. The kicker view in your New York Times piece was that disqualifying Trump might not be enough or likely wouldn't be enough. You can't just do that. I think Democrats have really been counting on that to a considerable degree. Explain that a bit. I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don't think have either thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary Clinton's campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message."
bI10q71Ha1x,8402,A.B. Stoddard,"And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day. So he's been rewarded by the primary electorate and the fact that his rivals cannot bring themselves to criticize any of that. Do you think DeSantis... Two questions. He launches in 10 days or so, does he start criticizing Trump more directly either because he can't win or because he wouldn't actually be as good a president as he DeSantis would be? And also it seems like DeSantis's strategy is focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, if you win both of those, you're probably the nominee, if you win one of them, you have shot at being the nominee, and that's how an underdog typically gets to at least parody with a front-runner, you win Iowa, Obama won Iowa and so forth, McCain won New Hampshire in 2000. McCain fell short, Obama won the nomination, but in each case that's how they became the plausible alternative to the person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W."
Cw9Atmx1c-c,9283,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary? I guess not. It just makes me so sick. I wrote that for The Bulwark months ago. They're not allowed to say that he didn't win the election. Chris Sununu says that, Chris Christie says that. Mike Pence says things like, ""I didn't do what he wanted me to do because I didn't have the constitutional authority to on January 6th,"" and will always disagree, but he doesn't like to come out and say, ""We lost the election."" He really avoids that. But you shouldn't incite mobs. It's the story of the Capitol. But they won't even, they will not even criticize January 6th. So not only will they not say he lost, they will not say he definitely tried to steal an election, he plotted a two-month coup, he incited a deadly a riot where people died. They won't touch January 6th. They won't touch his coup plotting. And so the message they're sending everybody is that it's okay. And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day."
3Wi973ipfLj,7478,Tom Tugendhat,"It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia. And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people."
5f7wrD_pX-b,7498,Tom Tugendhat,"We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know? But he still did it. He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it. I think we underestimate the importance of President Zelensky's courage to the shape of the world as it will be in 10 years time. If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty."
jBYKe0-e8-5,7583,Jack Goldsmith,"And a very high percentage of pardons, when you think about it, including Clinton's example, which are pretty deplorable, the huge majority of them are cleaning the record as a favor of someone. Maybe you shouldn't do it. It's not quite equitable. But the two previous family pardons, Bill Clinton's brother, I think had served a year in jail in the '80s. Clinton pardoned him in 2000 to kind of clear the record, so to speak, and the same was true... There's another one, which I'm blanking on, but where it's a very similar situation. Yeah, I can't remember, but there's one other. It's a previous... It's an old, so to speak. Yes. This was the middle of a court case. He'd gone to trial, he'd chosen to go. It was kind of messed up the way the plea deal fell apart, but he'd chosen, in any case, to go to trial. There was a jury. It wasn't like this was some arbitrary star chamber thing. I don't think people thought the trial was particularly unfairly conducted or anything. He was, of course, ready to appeal. He had plenty of attorneys to do that. I feel like doing it in the middle like that is more egregious in a way than doing a favor for someone that you respect or to be fair to someone you think was a good civil servant, a good public servant who deserves to, in a sense, have a break retrospectively."
CLlczfnv8s2,7208,Jack Goldsmith,"So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter. And so, again, one can be optimistic or pessimistic about what they're going to do. And I suppose whether it's one as optimistic or pessimistic is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah, Trump was amazing on just this past Sunday to ""Meet the Press."" He had, I'd say, half the time, was being pretty careful to, ""I'm not going to order anyone to do anything. It's their call."" On other issues too, mass deportations, while the Dreamers. ""Well, we try to work that out with Democrats."" And then, the other half of the time, it was, ""Well, Liz Cheney deserves to be in jail."" Right. And that, I found a little astonishing from the president elect to say about a member or former members of Congress, all the members of that committee deserve to go to prison. And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime."
ingdPYoPXYb,20295,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
9jkMYlduWmB,17982,Anne Applebaum,"Buying certain kinds of American products or big investments, investing in American defense technology, by accepting the dominance of American tech companies. All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another. And really very suddenly all that looks different. And I can't tell you right now exactly what the implications will be or whether it can be reversed by further actions down the line. I mean, I suspect among other things that Putin doesn't really want to end the war. And so, I don't know exactly what the... I still have no idea what Trump is talking about when he says the war will end this week or it'll end by May. I'm not sure what he means. But all those things suddenly begin to look different. And the conversations happen in all kinds of contexts. So in boardrooms, in government offices, everyone who deals with the United States in any context is suddenly saying, ""Wait, are all the assumptions that I've based 30 years of decisions on or 80 years of decisions on, are all those assumptions wrong?"" And again, maybe this is going to be reversed and maybe it's not going to be as extreme as people think."
GlQ-NBk894r,7208,Invisible Rulers,"Because eroding confidence in institutions and repositioning yourself as the source of authority and trust is good business for somebody who's trying to sell Twitter or Substack subscriptions or whatever. That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else. It's very divided, and that's why that sense of how do we put reality back together? Well, people who believe Elon, when he says that there was, what was it, 50 million in condoms to Gaza or something, that's just wild theories come out of nowhere. And the fact check doesn't reach people. It takes it to another level, as you say, when he's standing in the Oval Office, and then when a whole bunch of government organizations, and he's got huge people in government who want to keep him happy, have a big incentive to these things. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's actually that- And so it's not just Elon, it's the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary of DH, whoever. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's that they can act on them now. So 10:30 this morning was the RFK Jr. confirmation hearing. I assume he sailed through. I assume it went through on party line. Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised when we're done. I doubt it. But now we have a person who has been propagating the vaccines cause autism conspiracy theory leading Health and Human Services."
XGg9OIz-JGT,7473,Invisible Rulers,"But Mike Shellenberger wrote it in his newsletter, and then Mike Benz said it on Joe Rogan. And this is audiences of millions of people, and they write very carefully, but they say the thing, and know their audiences trust them and are not going to believe the correction. And they're not going to believe... They're never going to walk it back. But that's the sort of divide that we live in at this point. There's no evidence offered beyond the theory, but that's where we've kind of gotten to. Well, or some sort of fake evidence of some, as you say, misread spreadsheet. Or they like actually evidence in the wrong way. Right? Conspiracy theories always like... Joe McCarthy waved around the lists. I mean, they like to have a datum, I guess, that's not real or that's one exaggerated, or totally made up point. But they always want to have... It's funny how they- RENÉE DIRESTA: That is true. Usually, there's a screenshot. There is a- Yes, there's a thing. RENÉE DIRESTA: This is what happened... In the conspiracy theories about us, they actually... So when I was at Stanford Internet Observatory, the same people I just mentioned, Shellenberger and Benz, came up with this theory that we had censored 22 million Tweets. And the evidence of that was in a report that we wrote."
dkk6JdhZ2Oc,3011,Ryan Goodman,"It's not predicated on riots. It's predicated on violence or political protests. The part of the executive order that applies across the country that's anticipatory or preemptive also is only based on protests, if there is a threat of protests. So that's how extreme that is. Back to your particular question of what can the courts do about it, at some level I was a little surprised even that Judge Breyer at the District Court did try to stop on the administration from the federalization of the Guard because courts give so much deference to the executive branch. There's also some indication from the Court of Appeals panel, even though they find in favor of the Trump administration, that they say, ""We're also not going to accept the Trump administration's position,"" which is that this is all complete and deference political question doctrine, that the court shouldn't be involved. That they do some analysis of the facts, which I think is positive, but courts are weak in this particular space. To me, it's one of their spaces in which courts... one should not rely on the courts. I don't have faith that the Supreme Court is going to push back against the power of a president to say that there's a national emergency and need to bring out the National Guard to protect federal buildings, federal functions."
TiSJHVnk4P7,3154,Ryan Goodman,"So, I think Trump is supercharged after that opinion as he did with a performance with a press conference. So, that's where I think it's not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House. Yeah, it seems like they haven't given him that many victories on the big substance yet. Perhaps whether it's Humphrey's Executor will be radically limited, or struck down, and we'll see what happens on some of these other Alien Enemies Act, even some of them that presumably might go against Trump, presumably on the executive order on birthright citizenship. But certainly procedurally, I guess is the way I think of it. Maybe I'm simple minded, but they're giving him the benefit of the doubt an awful lot. And again, maybe in a very narrow sense, some of those decisions are their judgment calls, or whatever. It's a matter of court procedure. It's not a of high constitutional principle, but the effect of it is to let him go very far in practice down the path he's on without the courts being able, while curbing really the ability of the lower courts to do much to stop him. And in that context, that DVD decision at the beginning of last week, so that was the sixth three decision on Monday, I guess before the six-three decision on Friday that you mentioned the CASA decision."
4KF3pgDLdCi,4217,Eric Edelman,"Who knows what might happen? I think a lot of unexpected things can happen. The Russian army could crack under the strains it's under; the Ukrainian army could crack. They're in extremis right now. So, you could get a catastrophic collapse on the battlefield of some sort or other. I'm not predicting that; I'm just saying these are the kinds of things that could happen. You could get a collapse of the North Korean regime. The Assad regime, nobody thought it was going to collapse in two weeks. These regimes always look strong, but they're completely fragile and on the inside. Russia is more fragile than we think. Think back to the Prigozhin mutiny, I think it's arguable that had Prigozhin not lost his nerve, he might have actually taken Moscow. So, all of these things are out there. The Chinese still spend more on internal security than they do on external security, which is an indication of how concerned the leaders are about their own populace. It's the nature of all of these regimes. The Iranian regime, the collapse of Assad and the success of the Israeli retaliation rate in Iran have exposed, I think, the fragility of that regime, which is loathed by the majority of the population. So, the potential for upheaval, unanticipated shifts is always out there and tends to impose itself on every administration that comes in."
FW84jX3-L8s,3988,Eric Edelman,"Erdogan prevailed on Trump to pull US forces back. Trump tried to get them all out, the so-called adults in the room, Jim Mattis and others, kept this small force there. Whether they'll be able to prevail on him a second time, up in the air, but Erdogan also had, like the Saudis, a family-to-family relationship with the Trump family. And the Trump organization, of course has business interests in Istanbul. Again, this was a son-in-law-to-son-in- law relationship. How much of that stays in place with Jared Kushner formally outside the administration? Little hard to tell, but as you say, yes, the relationship with Erdogan was a very cozy one, and that could have a role here. So keeping an eye on Trump's decision to seal down those troops in Syria is another little thing that people haven't focused on that could be quite a big deal early on. And he could be under some pressure from his own people who want to get US troops out of all these places since we shouldn't be involved in Middle East wars. Yikes. So after Trump gets this briefing on the Middle East, it'll occur to someone for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. He'll be impatient anyway, but it'll occur to someone that will, ""Hey, it's the largest land war in 80 years that's going out of Europe, and that you've pledged to end, Mr."
Uq0_kzE6Log,13020,John Bolton,"And from other departments and so forth. Nixon IRS-type things, obviously, but also the degree of internal crisis of governance we could have. Don't you think- That's exactly right. It'll make the Saturday Night Massacre look like a tea party because the number of enemies he wants to prosecute is so large that this is really going to overload the Justice Department system. In other departments, you could see similar things. For example, Trump decides to order the 82nd Airborne onto the streets of Portland Oregon because he doesn't like what's going on. Who knows what his reason is? But the Posse Comitatus law, which generally prohibits the use of the military and law enforcement, is a very strong and important tradition. What's Pete Hegseth going to do? He is just going to say, ""Yes, sir?"" Maybe so. So, he then turns to the pertinent military commander and says, ""Do this."" What's that military commander going to do if he's got a legal opinion from some career Department of Defense lawyer that says that violates Posse Comitatus, you know officers are not supposed to carry out illegal orders. That's why Lieutenant Calley got prosecuted for the My Lai Massacre. You don't carry out orders to do that sort of thing. Are they going to refuse to carry out an illegal order?"
pOzA70GYu_4,15977,John Bolton,"Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist."
Fo8wxT_EQqM,5005,Steve Vladeck,"I don't know, presumably- Crimes. What? I mean, he's accused, right? He accused Representative Ocasio-Cortez of breaking the law, right? Yeah. He's accusing of breaking the law for their Congressional... for giving speeches. And so all this kind of craziness, the domestic terrorism on Tesla is kind of... One could see it being more extreme 18 months from now. A lot would depend on the courts and the Congress. I mean everything would depend I suppose, on the courts and Congress. Courts, of course, are a bit of a changing thing because Trump gets to make appointments, maybe not at the Supreme Court, depending on whether people retire but at the appellate and district court level. So I'm just curious, I mean, A, what do you think about the next, let's say this term of the court? I think that's an obvious moment to think about. And then more broadly the next year and a half in terms of sort of risks, what worries you the most? What kind of encourages you a bit, et cetera? So just one note on the courts. I mean, it's interesting Bill, that we're 50 days into the administration and we have not seen a rash of judicial retirements. Usually, when you have a political turnover, a partisan turnover, a whole bunch of judges who were waiting for the next president from their side of the aisle to be elected come right to the front the line and say, ""I'm stepping down."" We haven't seen that, which I think is an interesting data point."
4M6BS0TJ8hr,5095,Steve Vladeck,"And at least since the 1880s, we've had a robust tradition of a civil service, of a statutorily and regulatory protected civil service where folks can earn protection from being fired, where we don't expect the janitor at the Department of Energy to be someone who's hired or fired because of their connections to the current president. Yeah. And the trade-off was, in a way they accepted perhaps lower salaries and less opportunities for big windfalls because they had the security of a government job. Now within that category, as someone who was chief of staff of a department, they were the Schedule C employees, the political appointees who were fireable, hireable at will basically and fireable at will. They were a rather small number- I mean, that's the key. ...were at least of this huge pyramid. And then there was this massive civil service space. So Trump is going way beyond, I mean of course every administration removed, if it comes in with succeeding the opposite party, pretty much all the Schedule C's leave and you put in your own Schedule C's. So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments."
BhP6vhwvNd8,6420,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't mean to be complacent about it, but we should look at the broader picture and the things we can do to deter them by threatening to use or increasing our capacity to use a variety of different instruments. Which in part brings us back to where we started because I had this conversation in Europe with someone who follows China closely. I said, ""What's the most important thing you think we could all do?"" He said, ""Stick with Ukraine, win the war in Ukraine, make Putin's gamble really, really, really not pay off as they see the analogy and the lesson."" So, I was going to ask more broadly as we conclude what to look for over the next months and year, maybe in terms of US actions and other actions around the world that Chinese actions that might tip us off about where things are going. But I suppose Ukraine really matters, right? I think it does, and they're watching it closely. If Western resolve crumbles or if the Western alliance begins to break apart, that's going to make Beijing more confident that it can deal with whatever the consequences of their acting against Taiwan might be. They may be hoping that in the next American presidential election, a candidate will be elected who will be much less supportive of Ukraine and perhaps they'll take some comfort from that."
DpcI7m0ORFE,6859,Aaron Friedberg,"So, I think the smart money would bet that we've got him for quite a while. Until his health fails, he's not going to... These guys don't generally retire peacefully, especially if you've thrown as many of your enemies in jail as he has. He's got to stay on the tiger. And I think he intends to, partly because he sees himself as the crucial figure. The environment that Beijing, that Xi Jinping himself faces, has in many respects become more challenging over the last couple of years. And I guess we'll talk about the external part, but internally, there's COVID, COVID lockdowns, increasing dissatisfaction with those lockdowns, a sudden reversal of policy, abandonment of ""Zero COVID,"" letting the disease just sort of rip through the country. We don't know for sure, but it's probably been over a million people who have died of COVID just in the last month or so. So, they made a decision that their attempts to stamp it out were not going to succeed indefinitely, and they were willing to pay the human cost and the cost of some further temporary economic disruption to get through that and to get on with business. But even more important, I think, are the deeper sort of underlying challenges that China faces in trying to continue down the path of economic growth."
eRx6v1T1M-0,2552,Jason Furman,"And so they would try to figure out how to rule in a way that lets the president decide all executive branch things except monetary policy. That being said, the Supreme Court's a wild card. Donald Trump is a wild card. And I think this episode we've just gone through is a good reminder to care and pay more attention to some of the tail risks. It's not just Trump derangement syndrome to think he might do some of the things that he said he would do. I suppose the Fed would get into the crosshairs-and Trump's crosshairs-in a big way, if the economy slows. And he's always been a low-interest rate guy and he wants the Fed to cut, and he did in the first term, and he'll urge them to do it again. And Powell will say, ""I'm sorry, inflation is now at 3.7% or something, I can't cut."" And that would be the scenario, right? I suppose. Exactly. I think the most likely scenario where he goes after the Fed and- Exactly. We're heading into something where he wants them to do something they're not doing, and he doesn't really care as much about market constraints anymore, and there's been some permissiveness from the courts. So all of those are what could come together. And again, this is just something that is well within the realm of possibility."
jEvb44euMvt,2430,Jason Furman,"My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are. And in terms of inflation, some prices are going up in April, which means when you get the CPI print in May, that'll show you the April numbers. I think you'll see some sort of pop there. And by the way, just as an aside, it does puzzle me that people in the Trump administration, their economic officials are saying it's not going to show up in prices because we're going to know the answer to this question. This is not like an academic study a decade from now is going to try to tease out the effects of this. It'll be clear and they will either be right or they'll be wrong. And I think they're pretty likely to be wrong. And how soon, I guess, will we really see, will there be just a consent? Well, if they're wrong, how soon will we know that in a sense, more certainly that we do just from the theories and the models and I guess the opposite also."
tepCWhGQ1OI,6911,Aaron Friedberg,"We're all just sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they're dealing with now. Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you're saying is I just worry also though about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months. I mean, that is to say, what does the world look like in October of 2024? Are we confident Ukraine hangs on and is able to at least stabilize the situation, which itself isn't great in a way, a frozen war without USA? Are we confident there will be USA? Are we confident about what happens in the Middle East? What about the Taiwan situation? So, the degree of just a very short-term instability in the middle of an election year with Trump as the probable nominee and everyone and him saying certain things, weighing in on everything presumably, which then affects the instability. I mean, I think people, we haven't really gone through that either, honestly. And so, in a way, not really, I would say even in 2016 where people didn't think Trump was going to win or 2020. And again, that was all before February 2022 and before October 7, 2023. So yeah, we'll have a lot more to talk about even this year."
85uN5cFm6DH,6906,Aaron Friedberg,"People made this comparison, I think we did when we talked last year, to the North Korean attack on South Korea in June 1950, and the decision that the Truman administration made to ratchet up defense spending and to solidify NATO and so on. Different, undeniably, and maybe less intense. It was pretty intense, but maybe it was different than the Russian attack on Ukraine, but there was a model there for rallying the American people, and it seems to have passed, unfortunately. Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly, obviously, for things that could... but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents. But the Trump thing is... I mean [inaudible], ""Oh, you don't like Trump, so you're just saying this."" But of course it really isn't just analytically so different that he's going to, presumably, going to be the nominee again. I was thinking about it. Take the Trump, take the Truman example, just a very simple way. Roosevelt in '44, and Truman in '48 all ran against Republicans who defeated the isolationist wing of their party and therefore were more or less..."
o2ogvT8ILKL,6737,Bill Galston,"It's almost hard to believe that that could be quite correct, but it is what it is, a real poll, and it ends up with Whitmer winning by 12 or 13, or something like that. And abortion, when asked, then is a big concern to a lot, especially of the Whitmer voters. And I'd be curious about thoughts on this while we're... And in the breakouts, I was talking with Ron Brownstein about this, who looked down at the cross tabs and so forth. It was penetrating, it was helping Whitmer a lot among working class white women, not just among college educated. I wonder if you think there's some potential for Democrats to ameliorate the damage that's been done to them among white working class in general, but especially women, perhaps if those women may not be so much on board. The Republican in Michigan has a pretty, I think, no exceptions stance on abortion. There are some women who are willing to accept a no exceptions stance, but not very many. That's hard turf to defend. Look, I think experience has taught both of us that a single state poll is not something you can put in the bank, but if it's confirmed by others, it will be more than suggestive. And I do think... Let me step back."
3MvQHqP0t2G,6943,Bill Galston,"So it's very specific. Let me just ratify your general point, and that is that Kansas is a red state, but it is a red state, I believe, with a democratic governor and it's a red state that indicated very, very forcefully at the ballot box that it was prepared to lean red but not to plunge into a vat of red dye. It said this far but no farther. And if you look at a state like Kansas, the sorts of people that it sends to the Senate, or at least used to send to the Senate, the Doles and the Kassebaums of this world, I think that ethos in Kansas is still there. And so we're going to have to differentiate a little bit more among quote, unquote ""red"" states. Kansas is not Alabama. And this is a [inaudible] of mine which I'll indulge for 30 seconds. I think you agree with it, though, that people who were... The last 10, 20 years, you would've been right about a lot of elections by saying demography is destiny, as you said, geography is destiny, It's the red districts, blue districts, and it's gotten more polarized. And so people like me who said, well, I don't know, that candidate's terrible, didn't matter. That candidate's good. If you were running for the Senate in South Carolina and you were a fine Democrat or Kentucky, didn't make any difference at all."
bT9cNsvOjc2,4570,Ray Takeyh,"And speaking of leadership, what about the supreme leader who's, what is he? 86 years old, and- 86 years old, yeah. Assuming he physically survives because there are reports that his life could be targeted, was considered a target, assuming he survives. And there is actually a problem with killing a national leader. It is a legally dubious proposition. This is not Nasrallah. He's a leader of a recognized sovereign government. It's generally not a good idea to commission the assassination of national leaders. That has to be said as a preamble to this conversation. If he survives, he will not be supreme. He may be a leader, but he will not be supreme because his cascade of miscalculations have led Iran into this position. By the way, he will have critics on the left, more importantly, on the right. On the right, there will be those who will say to him, and they did say, in the aftermath of October 7th, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rules of the game are different now. Israel will approach the Middle East differently than it has in the past. And you saw their intervention in the Gaza Strip. Subsequently, obviously Hezbollah. There were voices within the Revolutionary Guards, we know that by their publications that were saying, ""If the Israelis have changed the rules of the game, then we should change the rules of our game."
DiDXinrsAXS,5033,Ray Takeyh,"It could go very dangerously. He could finally concede that we're going to build a nuclear weapon, we're going to do whatever we have to do. And also we are going to see, once the population takes account of this, right now the people are leaving their homes from the cities, they're leaving their home from Tehran, once they come back and recalibrate their lives and take accountancy of all this, how they will react to the next regime outrage. And there's always another regime outrage. So that the notion of how this will sort out for the Iranian politics is a post-crisis situation, is a post-crisis development, that's when you see it. But we're still very much in middle of a crisis, or at the beginning of a crisis or a beginning of the beginning of crisis, I don't know where we are. But that's kind of what you look for to see what kind of a regime can actually limp out of this, if any. And there's another online possibility of a simple military coup by the Revolutionary Guards against the civilian leadership. I don't see that happening because they're very much intertwined. They require religious sanction for their violence. That's just the way... They're revolutionaries. The Soviets kept talking about Lenin and all that, Karl Marx and Engel and all that nonsense because they may not have understood it, but they needed those foundational text to justify their misrule."
DLbw16rUvnp,19163,Anne Applebaum,"But Ukraine has recovered from the very low point of three or so months ago when they didn't have the prospects of war aid and they were really beginning to lose ground. So I would say on the ground, that's where we are. I suppose for all these reasons, including the new uses of technology or the new technologies, it's a little unpredictable actually, if things might break in one direction or another, but I guess, am I right that the safer prediction or assumption is not huge changes in the balance of power or balance of forces on the ground over the next several months? So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian."
KGTUGKi42-4,18921,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have. And so there could come a point when he doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, there's another additional piece of this, which is this war is over when the Russians leave, and it doesn't matter why they leave, they can leave because they lost a battle. They can leave because they are tired. They can leave for economic reasons. And one of the things that's actually happening as we're speaking is that the G7 is meeting, and at the G7, there are going to be a number of things announced. Some have already been leaked, that will increase pressure on Russia. So there will be money that was Russian assets that were frozen at the beginning of the war. The interest from those assets is going to be used essentially to give $50 billion to Ukraine. Also, there's new sanctions on not just Russian companies, but companies that are enabling Russian companies to get around sanctions, especially concerning the rebuilding of their military industrial complex."
s3Ok-nFcyHA,13323,John Bolton,"Well, I think we will have crises because I think some of them are just incapable of showing good sense. Again, this fellow who's the acting US attorney in the district has been sending letters to medical journals, questioning what they're writing about the various diseases. The argument being this could be fraud or corruption of some kind. This isn't going to go very far. Trump's executive orders against the law firms where they have been challenged, where law firms haven't given in, have uniformly been struck down. And I think we'll see whether a number of the other executive orders he's trying to float don't find the same fate. Again, it looks like Trump is succeeding in a wide variety of areas. The litigation is slow to catch up because that's the way the courts operate, but I think it's justice itself that's going to find it harder and harder to do the kinds of things Trump pushed his lawyers in private practice to do. And you think the administration ultimately more or less yields to these court decisions? Well, if they don't, then we will have a constitutional crisis. There's no doubt about it. I think the courts have been pretty restrained, frankly, in the way they've approached this. There are plenty of places where you could see contempt citations being administered, but the courts are building a record because they know every time they do it, it will be appealed."
ambRglpPA_3,12367,John Bolton,"So Vought and Miller are very powerful. Is your general sense, again, as you've talked to a lot of people who are in there and very close to it, people on the Hill, I want to get back to that in a minute. A sense that they are powerful also in terms of compared to the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, traditionally very powerful figures in a cabinet. Is that your sense this time around? I think that we'll have to see now as Elon Musk's influence fades, and I don't think he's going to be doing a day or two a week at the White House. I think when somebody goes, they go, they may come back once a month or something, and I think that means the DOGE operation, to the extent it still exists hidden somewhere in the executive office of the president will also see its influence diminish. But that may be an opening for Russ Vought, that he will take over that job. But overall, I think more and more decisions will be made in the White House and fewer decisions in the cabinet in the second Trump term than in recent presidencies. I think that's the clear message going ahead. Because I think people will be afraid to do something that might front run Trump and make a decision that he doesn't want to make."
