OuneHeKK-IQ,2876,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status. That's something a lot of people had not heard much about and suddenly became a thing, TPS. Trump could make it harder for some of those people to stay in the country and not extend their status or curtail their status, perhaps. How does that work? Explain maybe for a second. There are quite a few people on temporary protected status in the country. That's right. And I think this is a good point to emphasize that the biggest immediate changes Trump can make on day one or within the first few months is to legal immigration and people who have some form of temporary legal status in the United States. So, for people who have temporary legal status, we estimate there's around 2 million people who currently are in the United States with some form of temporary executive-led legal status. Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole."
Q8Vh2bZnzv4,2648,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Nevertheless, they'll still be able to use that propaganda to say, ""We are protecting Americans."" And to emphasize, I think a few other points on here, of course, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not criminals. The undocumented population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born American citizens. Same is true for legal immigrants because people of course, sensibly, do not want to show up on a government radar and generally don't like to stick their heads up. And the undocumented population is really part of every community. And if they actually did manage to round everybody up, it could have really devastating impacts on the United States economy in particular with massive spikes in inflation, a drop overall of the economy. We estimated if 11 million people are deported, we estimated GDP could drop 4.2 to 6.8%, which is as high or higher than the percentage drop during the Great Recession. And the economic implications could be dramatic. But we are in a world right now, days before Trump takes office where we can predict a number of different scenarios, but we can't say which one of them will come true. We can say it's probably unlikely-almost impossible-that 11 million are deported. But given this new world we are in right now, and with the possibility of this massive influx of funding, saying how much they're going to get and how quickly they can ramp up this enforcement, it's still tricky."
5PfcIrCdcAJ,2975,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole. All of those are statuses that can be revoked by the incoming administration. There are different processes that they have to go go through. Parole could theoretically be revoked en masse on day one. DACA, because it's tied up in litigation right now, we cannot rapidly get rid of. There's a whole bunch of legal procedures they'd have to go through, but nevertheless, we expect him to try. And with TPS, the law does provide some minimum time periods before it can be terminated, and it's unclear if he would terminate it for everybody. The single biggest population of people with temporary protective status right now is Venezuelans about 600,000 Venezuelans. Just be clear, these are people for whom there would be a danger of being sent back to their country and that's why they have this temporary status, right? Yeah. So temporary protected status is for people... It's a status that the Department of Homeland Security can grant to any country or even subset of a country where sending those people back would be a problem because of armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other serious issue that would make it dangerous to send them back."
HdIEqJej-bQ,2700,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Anyway, but on the border, it seems to me that if he can get, if Trump can keep cooperation from Mexico, it just feels like two or three months from now he could be saying border crossings are low, and they could have footage of the border being sort of quieter than it looked a year ago, right? Just for political [inaudible]... Yeah, absolutely. And there was a Trump effect eight years ago, the first time he came into office, where migrants looked at his rhetoric and said, ""We're going to wait a little while to see what's actually going to happen."" So in spring 2017, I think April 2017 saw the lowest number of border patrol apprehensions in 50 years since this 1970s, the early 1970s. And that's not because Trump had done anything. It's because migrants were looking at all of his rhetoric and going, ""We'll see how much of this is bark and how much of this is actual bite."" And I fully expect something similar to happen in the first few months of his term where border crossings will drop, not because of any change in policy, but more because people are just waiting to see whether he's going to carry out these harsh policies that he said he would on the campaign trail. And just to finish with this, none of this really has big legislative implications, it sounds like this is all stuff Trump can just do."
8f80YMM3t20,2988,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on. So we could see 2 million people lose their ability to live here legally and to work. That doesn't mean they're going to be deported, however, because when you lose the status, you just kind of become undocumented. So he could render 2 million people fully undocumented as opposed to what they are now, kind of semi-documented. They don't have permanent status, but they do have temporary status. You could just get rid of that and sort of put them in the population of the undocumented and then make efforts to deport them. But they would still too have to go through the immigration court backlogs potentially. And then when it comes to legal immigration, of course he can cut legal immigration much more easily than any of this. It's much easier for the president to stop people from entering the country- Yeah, say a word about that because of course, the famous Muslim ban in the first term was that. It wasn't removing people who were here, or it wasn't stopping people at the border particularly."
7GMHzrNfYY5,2700,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"It is extended every 18 months. Every 18 months DHS has to make a new decision whether to keep extending it or to terminate it. And so most of the designations now are set to expire in 2026, thanks to the Biden administration very recently extending four TPS designations and some are set to expire in 2025. If Trump does what he did in his first term when he tried to terminate TPS, at the moment when they are set to expire, he will announce that there will be no further statuses but gave everybody one final extension of 18 months and said after those 18 months, that's it. So if he does that again, we would see most TPS designations really expiring in 2027 and 2028. With DACA again Joe Moakley Could he cut them off though now? Could he come into office and say, ""Biden tried to extend this?"" Not immediately. But he can't say, ""I revoke Biden's extension and you Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, you've got to go in three months,"" or something like that? He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on."
R2Xj7fJ4MGB,2809,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And it's of course, just to emphasize, it is a crackpot legal theory pushed by John Eastman, primarily. The disgraced and disbarred John Eastman of the 2020 Big Lie efforts to overturn the election. He is the main legal ""scholar,"" and I put ""scholar"" in quotes here, who has argued that the president can do this. There is no groundswell of conservative judicial support for this. This is not something the conservative legal movement has ever supported. Even some arch-conservative judges right now put in place by Trump have said in the past that birthright citizenship is obviously the law of the land. And this is not even something that's from the 14th Amendment. We've had birthright citizenship since the founding of the country. It's an ancient English common law practice that has been around for centuries. Do you think he will issue an executive order, which will immediately get enjoined in court, presumably just to say he's done it? Yeah. Pretty much. I think that's the most likely scenario. He issues an order. It's blocked in court within days. No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status."
LeV0-9bzHVw,2644,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Yeah, so he can legally find ways to make it very difficult for any migrants to be allowed into the United States. But as we saw with Title 42 the first time around, even if you sign an order saying not a single person should be allowed into the United States because of COVID, that doesn't actually mean that not a single person will be able to enter the United States and remain here. Some obstacles remain. First off, it's a 2,000 mile land border. It is extraordinarily difficult to stop everyone from crossing. And administrations have been trying for half a century, with not that much success, to bring numbers down to zero. No one's ever managed to bring numbers down to zero. And then secondly, some diplomatic issues will remain. So a good example is people who come from countries that don't accept deportations. If you cross the border today and you come from, say, China, China has restarted accepting some deportations in recent months, but they're taking about one deportation flight a month, each flight carries about 135 people. So if 5,000 people from China cross the border, it doesn't matter what the policy on the ground actually says. In immigration, presence is nine-tenths of the law. You are now on US soil. If the United States wants to deport you, then it is going to have find a country that is willing to take you."
Axh6k2-TYlb,2765,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"That's flagrantly unconstitutional. He can't do that. Obviously- And even he is saying, I think, that he would do it prospectively, presumably, not retroactively. Right? Yeah. Though of course, there's really no legal way that you could make that distinction, say, oh, okay, so the constitution requires you to have birthright citizenship up through January 20, 2025. But after that, no longer it does. So anything that he did there would- Well, an executive order could say that, though. Any executive order would still threaten people. Of course, one of the things we've heard him say, was stop granting passports to people who can't prove that both their parents were US citizens or had legal status when the child was born. Of course, plenty of US citizens need to get a passport who are not being born now. Maybe a 30, 40-year-old who was born to undocumented parents, would that person be denied a passport under this policy? We don't know. And so that... ways in which it could threaten people potentially whose were born decades ago. And it's of course, just to emphasize, it is a crackpot legal theory pushed by John Eastman, primarily. The disgraced and disbarred John Eastman of the 2020 Big Lie efforts to overturn the election. He is the main legal ""scholar,"" and I put ""scholar"" in quotes here, who has argued that the president can do this."
HHoHG9UHKXI,2882,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head. Based on the Trump administration, if they just get more aggressive on raids or whatever we're supposed to call them, and the targeted actions and if they have the good enough information to know where to target actions and stuff, which maybe they do, I don't know, I mean, what would the plausible number of people... What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people? Hundreds of thousands of people? Tens of thousands for sure, because even the Biden administration has deported tens of thousands of people with criminal records. The previous administration deported every single year. Now, of course, when we say criminal records, I want to emphasize the number one most common offense is traffic offenses of a prior record. The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry."
K1ohaoehyQm,6492,Larry Summers,"And so you can't really solve both problems. So I think we've done a very large amount of damage, and I tend to be an optimist about the United States. I think there's a lot of resilience. I do note that there has been at the most critical moments, some backing away from these kinds of policies. So we may work our way through this, but only if there's very substantial alarm and very substantial reversal. I think that the seventies is such an interesting analogy, and I thought about it a little before, more in political terms, but combining... I mean one way to think about it, maybe we had the oil shock in '73 basically, and then Nixon at the same time, considerable political instability leading to the resignation of actually Agnew, separate reasons in a way. Agnew then of course Nixon in '74, but that was about a year. I think what everyone thinks of their administrations-Ford and Carter tried to restore a certain kind of normalcy, you might say, to our politics and did to a reasonable degree. Obviously the economics of the rest of the seventies remained choppy to say the least. And it ultimately took whatever it took with Volcker and all this. But one thing that's really striking, leave aside post 2028 and how much of the damage remains, and I think that's a real concern."
6oJB6MJbhQs,6539,Larry Summers,"Look, they backed off there. Look, they're sending signals that they're just going to declare victory and not do anything real."" So that is the disturbing thing. And these things can tip very quickly. One of the first major financial dramas that I witnessed as an adult professional economist was the 1987 crash. And that had its roots in a risky environment, markets were high. That had its roots in there being some problems in the plumbing, lots of portfolio insurances, what it was called in those days. But the match that lit the fire was a spat between our Treasury Secretary, Jim Baker and the German financial authorities, and a question about whether the dollar would be allowed to fall. And investors all of a sudden decided they didn't want to be near this drama and got very alarmed over the weekend. And then on Monday we had a major crash. And that's the kind of event that this all makes us at risk of. It's pretty clear that the first of the many reversals, the reciprocity reversal that took place, came because the Trump administration in a matter of a few hours, became alarmed that this kind of thing could happen imminently. And indeed by all press accounts, the US trade representative was in the midst of testifying in Congress when he learned that there had been this dramatic reversal."
IfvkU4mBmNR,7034,Larry Summers,"Wherever it starts, the ball rolls to the bottom of the bowl. A ball on a football field has lots of equilibrium. Wherever the ball gets kicked, it stops and it rests. And systems are sometimes subject to a kind of cyclicality. Joe McCarthy came, the system processed through Joe McCarthy, and yes, it contributed to some dynamics in the 1960s, but you would probably have said that by 1970, whatever America's problems were, they were kind of not very different because we had the very bad Joe McCarthy episode. But sometimes events cast a permanent or near permanent shadow on the system, and I think that it is very likely that what we are seeing will have that kind of effect as future historians look back at things. And I suppose if the country fully repudiated this experiment and goes, ""We can never go back."" But went forward to a more stable governance. If it fully repudiated this experiment, then you're right, that might actually be what's happening. But it's difficult to do that. I agree. But I think it's going to be pretty difficult to do that. I think that an example for better or for worse is various changes in the way the confirmation power has been adopted by the Senate. Once that changes, it has changed and it is very hard to cause it to go back."
hONTikarah-,6406,Larry Summers,"Who the president selects as Jay Powell's successor, who the president ... How that person conducts themselves and demonstrates independence is something that will be very, very important. I do think it's important to note, and I think that a lot of these discussions at this moment as the president says things about Jay Powell, yet miss, is that the Fed is an institution, not a person. There's nothing that says that the other six members of the Board of Governors, or that the presidents of the regional banks are obliged to follow the lead of the president. In many other countries, the central bank is more like our Supreme Court in the sense that the Chairman is like the chief justice. The chief justice probably has more influence than the average justice does, but sometimes the votes come down and the chief justice is in the minority. And I think that if there were to be a successful effort to appoint an aberrant chairman, I think that aberrant chairman might find there weren't so many followers for the parade. And so I think there's a bit more insulation that is built into the system than these very personal discussions about chairs of the Fed would suggest. Look, I have said something on the subject of the dollar and things international, that I think that the general kinds of views that I've expressed continue to feel right to me, but in a different way than I used to say."
gGL2jFAqQhU,6636,Larry Summers,"No, absolutely. I do really think that it is important though to understand that it really is better if you're unhealthy because you're eating a gallon of chocolate ice cream every day, then you're unhealthy despite having a terrific diet. No, no. No, I take that point, that's a very important- I think that is a very important point to recognize about our current moment. Right. It's a good point and let's end on it. And it's, as you say, mostly a hopeful point, so that's a good thing to end on too. Larry Summers, thank you so much for joining me again and us again for this very, very interesting and thought-provoking conversation. Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
42BOJTEvS3Q,8065,Larry Summers,"I guess that's my... I really have come to this a hundred-day stuff. We're speaking here on, what is it, April 28th and it's almost a hundred days of the year, and it was a hundred days. That's a really a long time. A hundred days is one-fifteenth, I haven't done the math precisely of an administration's longevity. And if we're at this level of instability and uncertainty at one- fifteenth, could get better, but it could also just at least stay as bad or could get worse. If JD Vance were ever to ascend to the presidency. It is hard to imagine him saying that our long national nightmare is over as he ascended, and that is a very substantial difference. Richard Nixon, for all his many faults, knew the difference between right and wrong well enough to do his best to obscure all the wrong that he was doing. Donald Trump glories in the wrong that he's doing and wants it to be as public as possible so as to deter, intimidate, and cast a shadow over potential opposition. That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that."
FnuFtafNt0T,6408,Larry Summers,"People all sell and nobody quite knows who it is exactly who is selling. And they have the virtue that they're always open, and so they're sending signals in very rapid response to events. And all of that makes them a powerful force. But I think they're more effective with respect to some issues than with respect to other issues, and I don't think they are sufficient. Something I have learned over time from my own participation in public debates and watching others is that interventions are most effective when they're unexpected. So the impact of Nancy Pelosi shouting from the rooftops or The New Republic and Nation magazines being deeply concerned about civil liberties is much less than voices like yours or voices of Republican senators or business leaders or the kinds of people who President Trump has traditionally been very respectful of. Yeah, it may be that we'll look back on Liberation Day as a tipping point in this direction, in a good way, and that people stop being able to tell themselves it'll be like the first term, he'll be constrained by reasonably responsible advisors and national security policy and to some degree an economic policy. And as you say, tariffs go from 1.5% to 2.5% or something, not tenfold or even fivefold. And I do think the universities have been useful."
eUW0DWq0fiU,6660,Larry Summers,"That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that. And we don't have that confidence right now. We are not sure whether court orders will be followed. They might be. I don't think yet we have crossed the Rubicon into complete defiance of the judiciary, but we are sure sidling up to that Rubicon in a big hurry. And that is a very different thing than what we had before. Bill, the stories I hear of people who would've been inclined in various ways to be oppositional, but they weren't sure they could and be 100% confident of their family's safety, these kinds of stories are not what we expect in America. Now, I think it's very important not to have what people have started to call Trump derangement syndrome. I absolutely avoid any analogies with Germany in the 1930s, but I don't think it's necessary to avoid analogies with Argentina in the '40s, '50s and '60s. Argentina was a country where its standard of living in the first half of the 20th century weree in the same broad range as that of the United States."
NwE8cZ6sndc,7317,Larry Summers,"Let me say three things. The secret sauce of economics is arithmetic, so I think it's useful to just think about some numbers. The average tariff rate in the United States before Trump's first term was 1.5%. During his first term with really very considerable excitement, he doubled it from about 1.5% to about 3%. The proposals that he announced on ""Liberation Day"" took 3% to 28%. So it was a tenfold increase. It was 20 times larger almost than what he had done during his first term. There are differences in view about how to interpret precisely where we are or where things might go, but I know of no thoughtful observer who thinks the number's likely to fall below, well, something in the 12 to 15 range. So we are looking at an increment to tariffs five to 10 times conservatively as that which he applied during his first term. So it's a mistake to think of this as a respite from anything other than insanity. From the perspective of what people expected even on election day, on knowing that Donald Trump had been elected, what today is regarded as an optimistic scenario is a high tariff scenario. So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place."
DYzqjIjszqD,6342,Larry Summers,"But if it does, it will be in circumstances where that's the least of our problems. And the example is the loss of the British pound status as a reserve currency in the mid-1950s, particularly after Suez. Britain lost the pound as a reserve currency, but after Suez and in the 1950s, that was the least of Britain's problems. So we won't just lose the dollar as a reserve currency because others will build up deep capital markets and [inaudible] will shift towards their currency. But if we become a not predictable, not rule of law kind of place that is universally distrusted, that could lead to very substantial movements away from the dollar. But if we become a lawless place, the fact that we don't have the exorbitant privilege anymore that lets us borrow a bit cheaper will be the least of our problems. So I am worried about the future of the dollar, but more that it could be a symptom of even profounder and deeper problems than because it would itself be an impetus to decline. No, that's very interesting and well said. I guess there's a reason this discipline was originally called ""political economy"" and maybe should still be, and you treat it that way certainly. Politics matters a lot for economics and vice versa. What about the international side?"
tmx1c-ci3-D,17565,Anne Applebaum,"And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia? And we have analyzed this many times back and forth, and we've heard all the possible explanations, and none of them has ever really made any sense. I mean, none of it really adds up. As for Europeans, the first part of your question... So yes, Europe now-actually this has been true for a while, this has been true for more than a year-Europe in total gives more money to Ukraine than the United States does. And that's both money... Ukrainians now have their own industries. And so Europe funds a lot of the drone production, for example, inside Ukraine, or some of it takes place outside of Ukraine in neighboring countries. So, the European money, both producing weapons and giving them weapons, is now much larger than the US. Plus there's other kinds of economic support and so on. I think European, there was a kind of Czech-led project to collect ammunition from around the world, that's had an impact. And so there's no question that Europe is now the more important source of aid, military aid and economic aid for Ukraine than the United States."
xrzV7QDyDK2,17056,Anne Applebaum,"We'll talk about all those topics and update people, even if we can't entirely cheer them up. Well, thanks for having me. Always pleasure to talk to you, whether in real life or via Zoom. No, both are good. Okay. So you've been to Ukraine several times, obviously you know it very, very well. Been to it before obviously the war, then since the war, you're right there. You're spending a fair amount of time in Poland right across the border. So what's your sense of the actual situation on the ground in the war in Ukraine? So first of all, yeah, I'm in Poland now. I'm in Western Poland though, so not exactly near the front line, but still. I was last in Lviv a few months ago. I was there in the spring, and I'm actually supposed to go to Kyiv in September. I mean, I think one of the remarkable stories, and this is not very well told in the US, is that not that much has changed. Despite this kind of constant drumbeat of crisis and danger, and the Russians are going to take Pokrovsk, which is a big fortress town in Donbas, the Russians move forward very, very slowly. They are moving, but I was told at the current rate, they will take all of Donbas in something like four and a half years."
R7XGhwpb6pr,19375,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
wj1gK8CGscI,16207,Anne Applebaum,"It's much more eloquent than I just said it. And he meant it, I think. And he did a lot of things that really... We think of him as preserving the Union and the constitution, which is true, but also huge amount, of course, leaving aside the Emancipation Proclamation and winning the war. But I mean, many, many things he did were not... It was a kind of refounding of the republic, and I don't want to get too rhetorical or whatever, but one almost thinks that there has to be a little more thinking, I guess the way I would put it. It's a tricky thing. Jonathan Last made this point, I'll close by asking you this, the other day, which is it's tricky at one at the same time, defend the institutions that has to be defended, even though they're flawed, even though they've messed up in some ways because the alternative is so much worse. So, you have to defend... Justice Department wasn't perfect. The FBI wasn't perfect. The health services weren't perfect, but I mean, compared to what's on offer here, they need to be defended. But you also do have to have a path forward. They can't just be going back to the- No, we can't go back. No, they need to be defended and reimagined."
FDfZCTeQ8Ob,19959,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
7gvVOUnNDnw,17068,Anne Applebaum,"So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that. And I can't account for how that morale will eventually affect them. But the war continues not very much changed. And the Russians are not making a breakthrough and they've not achieved a victory. And so I think that's the first thing to say. I mean, I think the second thing to say is that, looked at from the point of view of the Ukrainians and indeed from the Poles and from Europe, all the events of the last couple of weeks that seemed so dramatic, the meeting of Trump and Putin in Alaska, the Europeans flying to Washington to meet Trump together with President Zelensky of Ukraine, all of it has had very little impact on the ground. And probably what it's doing is prolonging the war. So again, I have to be very careful how I say this because I too want these talks to succeed and I also want there to be a breakthrough. And I hope there are secret negotiations that I don't know about where something better is happening. But what we see from the outside, and indeed what the Europeans and the Ukrainians see, is simply President Putin stringing along Donald Trump."
yZJfNmPFs2v,16314,Anne Applebaum,"They still have huge advantages. But the fact remains that we are more than three years into the war, and the front line is barely moving. I mean, by the standards of wars. It moves a little bit, but the collapse of the front line that people were predicting six months ago never happened, and we're now at the end of the summer. So fighting will slow down as the weather gets worse. In Ukraine's case, the innovation is as they have been invaded and have territory conquered, and they're fighting right there, whereas I don't mean to minimize our achievements in World War II or other countries, Britain, Germany, et cetera, but we weren't partly occupied and weren't being, I believe Britain was, but we weren't being bombed every night and so forth. So I mean it is- No, I mean, actually one of the things that bothers me the most about the way Trump talks about Ukraine is he keeps talking about Ukraine has no cards. There was something he said a couple of days ago about how Ukraine is a small country, it shouldn't have gone to war with a big country. I mean, first of all, who invaded who? But there's this constant refusal to recognize this achievement, the holding the line. It is a smaller country, it is fighting a bigger country."
IrB1-N3u6T3,16287,Anne Applebaum,"I don't know. So generally, give me your sense of that in Europe. So yes, it's widespread. It includes the UK, it includes, I don't know, people like the Poles and the Czechs and the Romanians. Everybody, however they feel about it, whatever kind of government they are, including the far-right governments, they understand that there's been a seismic shift and everybody's seeking to adjust to that shift and to figure out how to cope with it. So there's no one who thinks differently. Maybe some like it. I mean, Viktor Orbán in Hungary presumably likes the change in the United States, and he's hoping to profit from it. But he too understands the scale of it. So nobody really doubts that. As for the stability, I don't want to make a general statement because these go election to election and each election is different. There is no question that there is in every European country, maybe one or two exceptions but almost none, here is a far right which is pro-Russian and which in some cases has been funded by Russia, or amplified by Russia on social media, or has had some special relationship with Russia, or with Russian propaganda, just like in the United States. Some of those parties are flirting with or experimenting with MAGA techniques. So they're watching what works in America and they're seeking to bring those tactics to Europe."
Wi973ipfLj5,16489,Anne Applebaum,"And this happened a few days ago. Using the FBI or its equivalents to conduct investigations into the president's personal enemies. People who have not broken any normal law or we don't know what kind of law they've broken. I mean, the breaking into John Bolton's house and ripping up his filing cabinet or whatever they did, I mean, why? And the idea that this is some kind of revenge for the FBI asking Trump to hand over files. I mean, that was an open process that was conducted over many days. And Trump was repeatedly asked to give back classified documents. And when he refused to give back the classified documents, which he was storing in Mar-a-Lago in his hotel, eventually somebody went in and said, ""We own these documents."" None of that happened with Bolton. We don't know why he was being investigated. And we do know that the head of the FBI tweeted about this investigation. So the politicization of these. This is a textbook case of how democracies go wrong and how countries become authoritarian or how people lose their rights is when you politicize agencies that are supposed to be neutral when there is no rule of law. And instead, there's rule by law. Rule by law means that the law is what the President decides it is."
f7wrD_pX-bt,17097,Anne Applebaum,"They are moving, but I was told at the current rate, they will take all of Donbas in something like four and a half years. Donbas is a tiny part of, well, it's a large part, but it's still pretty far Eastern Ukraine. So the Ukrainians continue to hold the line. They continue to innovate. They're building new drones. I've just seen some photographs actually of a new type of drone they've built that seems to be modeled on an Israeli model. They're now building their own missiles. I think another piece of the story that's really not understood is the Ukrainian campaign inside Russia against Russian refineries. And just in the last few days, they've hit several very large ones. And these are refineries that affect the internal Russian market. And one of the effects has already been long lines at gas stations all across, particularly, the eastern and southern parts of Russia. So the story that we're usually told, which is Ukraine is about to be crushed by Russia, and that actually President Trump seems to believe, is not true and hasn't been true for, it's not quite three and a half years, but three and a quarter years so far. So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that."
Ke0-e8-5CLl,6321,Tim Snyder,"That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that's very explicitly in their mind, that if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia? Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this- No, no. ...forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own... We have bubbles within a bubble, but there's one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often... I just put it very bluntly. We often just don't recognize that there's a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people and say rah-rah when there's not a vote for Ukraine aid."
czfnv8s2qt6,6185,Tim Snyder,"I think that's an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, ""These guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,"" which of course fascists are. Fascists have the cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness. And in that way, Milošević really was... he was somebody who talked about both... he does the thing which Putin does now and which Trump does now, which is that you somehow are both always the victim and you're always the victor at the same time. Like everybody's always against you and somehow it always turns out well, and whatever you do is okay because you're always already the victim. But yeah, I don't think, in coming out of the '80s into the '90s, a lot of the people that the United States had backed during the Cold War would have been called, if we had not been backing them, fascists. And so that's one reason why we're not sensitive to it. But I think the main reason we're not sensitive to it actually is a lack of reflection about our own history. I think that's really where we... that's our real problem. It's not anybody else, the problem is us. Yeah. And certainly someone like me who'd been on the conservative side, I feel like I've personally learned a ton about... and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and everything."
ingdPYoPXYb,6067,Tim Snyder,"Hopefully things look more promising in November 2024, and maybe we can talk more about the future and about a brighter future. Whereas I think, as you say, so well, I mean this... 2024 could be a real turning point, not just for Ukraine, but for all of us. I mean, couldn't it be a real inflection point in world history? Yeah. And it can still be a good one. It can still be a good one. Yeah. Thanks for reaching out. Tim Snyder, thank you so much for joining me today, and thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
9jkMYlduWmB,6734,Tim Snyder,"And that basically got laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay and they were going to fight. I didn't think they would do as well as they ended up doing. So here I'm going to join in your expectation. I want to start there somewhere else, which is why, I'm just going to pose it a different way, which is why didn't we take Ukraine seriously or to put it in the sharpest possible term, why was our expectation the same as Russia's expectation? Because both inside the Kremlin and inside the Beltway and inside the Beltway among both Republicans and Democrats, the expectation was Ukraine is going to fold in a few days. And why did we have that expectation? And I think that expectation arises from the deep fundamentals, the imponderabilia, the things that come before we even start talking about history or strategy or politics. I think that comes from a kind of very deep Russian subjective victory, which is Americans and most people in the West until 2022, somewhere deep down thought Russia's a real place and Ukraine is not a real place. And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud."
QjFGlQ-NBk8,6314,Tim Snyder,"He doesn't pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He's kind of a link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it's ultimately about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in Ukraine, there's so much bloodshed, is clarifying. It's because that is in fact what people like. It's not just that they're tolerating it, it's what they like. Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not literally necessarily '20s, '30s European fascism, but that's something... I don't know. I had the more conventional, I was an anti-communist. And then the Cold War ended and then we had various... I was on the interventionist side, liberal interventionists, conservative interventionists side, depending on the Balkans and Middle East. But I don't know, I somehow put that out my mind. You didn't because you studied, I think, that part of the world. So that's infinitely more than I had. But I think it's a real... that's not a happy revelation, but it's one that one should've of course known all along, I guess. Yeah. It's interesting that we dropped it in the US because the whole anti..."
94rXGg9OIz-,5886,Tim Snyder,"And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud. And then from that we reason to, ""they're going to flee."" And I think it's that deep unspoken thing which was basically mistaken. And that's where maybe I had an edge over other people because I studied the place. In the last 30 years, Ukrainian civil society has become more and more active and self-aware. And this is relevant for Americans too, successful at defending and pushing democracy forward because democracy doesn't just happen as we like to think. It unhappens, democracy naturally unhappens, you have to make democracy happen. And Ukrainian civil society step by step has managed to not only sustain, but make democracy a little bit less imperfect over time. And it's that same civil society then, which is behind the army, which is fighting the war. And it's that same state, which has gotten- you know, it's not perfect, but it's gotten better and better over time rather than worse and worse, which is fighting this war. And then of course, I think they were fortunate with their leadership too. I mean, it's kind of an argument for democracy that somebody as improbable as Zelensky would win an election."
JGTTmKfP1cw,6002,Tim Snyder,"They have held off, in large measure, a genocide. Wherever the Russians occupy, they have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people. Holding off a genocide is not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. There won't be a war in Europe so long as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army, because there's no way the Russian army can fight another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course, it can. And in my view anyway, they've made a war with China much less likely because they're showing how offensive operations are complicated and unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist Party that doesn't want to be embarrassed is going to pay attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who are willing to take risks for democracy, which is a pretty important example, I think, for us and for everybody. They're doing all those things for us. I think that's where the conversation should start. And then it's like, ""Okay, well then what are we doing for them? For this strategic bonanza and this moral example, what are we doing in return?"" I think that's where the conversation should be starting."
54m2nHMabhK,5855,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. Sorry to take so much time to answer it, but it's just a really simple yes. They make it 100% clear that this is what they're doing, and it's only... They know, unfortunately, that we're so narcissistic that we don't even notice. Anyway, for those of you viewers who want to notice, Julia Davis does a terrific job on her and her writing, and in her Twitter feed and on YouTube on just summarizing Russian propaganda day-to-day. If there's any uncertainty about this stuff, she's very helpful on this. And you read her. I read her on Twitter, it's so astonishingly both vulgar and... I don't know, simpleminded isn't even the right word, it's what's what you're saying. There's no artistry, and condescending to their American stooges, and that seems to have no... Not to hurt them much, and I think maybe it's important for them at home to show that we are in charge, and maybe we have these fellow... I think the Soviets were a little this way too to their fellow travelers. They didn't actually treat their somewhat stooge-like fellow travelers here in the US or in Western Europe with great respect, right? It's a very funny mix I think in both cases. I'm sorry, part of my mind is now thinking about how to translate Nashatrampushka ."
UeWJUA058lE,6069,Tim Snyder,"It's frozen."" So, it's an active hot war. It's a war of attrition in which you're right- But isn't it also, it's a Russian aim in some conflicts, whereas here, their aim isn't really a frozen conflict, is it? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, their aim as they make clear every day in the statements of their highest political authorities and their propaganda shows every evening, their aim is to destroy the Ukrainian state. I mean, for people who want to be fooled, there's still stories out there about the Russian language or NATO or whatever, but what they tell us every day is they're trying to destroy Ukrainian state and society. That's their war aim. And so long as they haven't done that, they're going to try, they're going to keep trying to do that on the Ukrainian side, yeah, they can sustain this for a long time, provided that they don't engage in ill thought through offensive operations or lose too many people. The main constraint that they have is that there are only so many Ukrainians and it's reasonable of them to be taking that constraint into account. Russia has more people, but also Russia, the Russian leadership doesn't care at all about losing its own people, whereas Ukrainian leadership to its great credit, does care. They have to balance preserving territory, winning the war and not losing too many people on the battlefield."
dkk6JdhZ2Oc,6132,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. ""We're on the right side of civil rights and we've..."" yeah. If we fix it, it's all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately. But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is connected to the America First stuff. Lindbergh's... The reason why Lindbergh likes the Nazis is that he wants to have, and I'm paraphrasing him now, but he wants to have a fortress of white people that are going to hold back the black and brown people. His fantasy is that we have a technological advantage across the Atlantic and, together with the Germans, we can basically keep the brown and the black people out of our countries. That's it. And it's direct organic. And you see that direct organic connection too, the folks now who talk about America First or isolationism very often bleed into or are quite openly on the wrong side when it comes to race. And then just as a footnote, it helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don't get. And I think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time around."
4P7mzi_4KF3,10060,Mark Esper,"He does need some professionals around him. He would sometimes at least often take their advice or look the other way as you didn't quite do things that he had off the cuff wanted you to do or whatever and so forth. But it does feel like since 2020, that process, let's say, of liberating himself from these different constraints and guardrails I would call them has accelerated. If anything, it hasn't gone back. He didn't rethink everything after January 6, 2021 and say, ""You know what? I should have listened to Mike Pence. I should have listened to Mark Esper. I should have listened to Bill Barr. I shouldn't have gone down any of these paths."" Well, look, every president learns on a job. There's no training to be president, although, some have less of a learning curve than others. George, again, H.W. Bush, who knew D.C., he knew the instruments of government is an example of somebody who had less of a learning curve. So I don't fault a president for learning on the job. Trump did not take those lessons as well. Look, in many ways, things we were recommending pushing back against proved to be true. I often wonder whether he looks back and says, ""Thank goodness they were pushing back on me."" The best example is Afghanistan."
pgDLdCiFW84,9895,Mark Esper,"But I think one thing we all share is we know that there's a responsibility that comes with being Secretary of Defense and for running the Pentagon that says, you are going to be apolitical to the degree that where it matters, certainly for sure. And so there's this sense of apolitical and your responsibility and staying out of politics, particularly for the military. And so that's kind of what brought us together, particularly as things unfolded and as the election denialism continued, there was a growing concern that, would the military get involved? And we all know now that there was that, I guess a meeting in late December with I think maybe it was Mike Flynn and others who said, ""Yeah, maybe we should send the military in to seize ballot boxes or to conduct another election."" I can't recall the details, but it was quite alarming that the military would be put in that context. I was concerned going into the fall that the military would be used at the time of the election when the results were revealed to put down protests to do other things and so that became more of my concern, immediate concern at that point in time. And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did."
jX3-L8s0qpN,10416,Mark Esper,"What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think. Right? I mean, I feel it's pretty big I think. Don't you think February 24, 2022 will be like a real, genuine moment in world history? Yeah. Look, I think it crystallized again this notion of a new era of great power competition with Russia and China being the adversaries. And keep in mind, it was just a few weeks before the invasion that Putin and Xi Jinping, the president of China, stood side by side of all places in Beijing at the Olympics, and they issued their 5,000 word statement about their strategic partnership and alliance, and would just be a few weeks later when Russia would invade Ukraine with armored columns and mechanized troops. And it was almost like the Nazi invasion of Poland in 39. I mean, it was just kind of a blitz into Kiev. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability."
Uq0_kzE6Log,9912,Mark Esper,"And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did. In my lifetime, if you had told me five, 10, 15, 20 years ago that there would be an insurrection on Capitol Hill and people would storm the Capitol and try and seize ballot boxes and threaten to hang Mike Pence, the vice president, it would be like a bad Hollywood movie. But it was real, and it should be a wake-up call for all of us. Well, to your credit, and you discussed this in the book at some length, in the spring/summer of 2020, you decided, I think in certain red lines that you needed to really be careful about, not just observing it yourself, of course you observed it yourself, but making sure that the Defense Department was not misused, that the military was not used inappropriately, that it wasn't politicized and used. Everyone was surprised, of course, by January 6th, but you were aware of the dangers, I'd say, of what might happen. Yeah, I ended up calling them the four no's. As you said, it was no politicization of the military, no strategic retreats, no misuse of the military. And of course, the fourth one would flee from my mind- No aggressive war."
pOzA70GYu_4,10659,Mark Esper,"It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades. It's really about China and it's about China, Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese naval vessels in Japanese waters, in Japanese exclusive economic zones, sailing around the Senkakus, which I think the Japanese recognizes. And by the way, it's not just them who are saying fund Ukraine, it's Taiwan too is saying, because they recognize the common principle at stake here. And the common principle is this, if a big authoritarian neighbor invades a smaller democracy for the sole purpose of seizing that territory and incorporating it into their own domain, we need to fight for those principles or else the global order that we've known that's produced peace and prosperity for the last 75 plus years is going to wither away. And that's not the world we want to live in when we're living under Chinese values and Chinese interests. It'll be a far different world for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Or a world in which Putin could just invade a neighbor and slaughter people and then get away with it, keep a good chunk of the territory or all of it. Yeah."
GaiQk4-PDeU,10008,Mark Esper,"Yeah, they need to do more, but they can't really ultimately do it without us either. So it's a- That's right. We need both to... I mean, the Japanese Prime Minister was kind of remarkable when he was here. Again, it wasn't commented on that much, he spoke to Congress, but I'd say he did stress the importance of winning in Ukraine or defeating Putin. I mean, that's from the Asia, some of the China Hawks want to distinguish Asia from Europe, and we should just focus on Asia and let Europe kind of fall apart. He rejected that pretty strongly, and he didn't have to, so to speak. He was speaking to the US Congress and he really wanted to make that point. The other thing is, you know better than I mean, going from 1% to 2% doesn't sound like that much in a funny way, but for them psychologically, that's a huge jump. Absolutely. That 1% has been kind of a pacifist Japan post-World War II thing- That's right. ...for 80 years. Yeah, it's more than just a number, it is a psychological threshold. It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades."
nB0LcO7PT_l,11227,Mark Esper,"With Ukraine, he said he'd cut off funding, cut off support, and he would negotiate an agreement within 24 hours. Yeah, what is that? Which is fancy fool. The only person who could stop this war in 24 hours is Vladimir Putin. But he's also attacked NATO, said it's not a good deal for the United States and had made attempts during his first term to undermine the alliance. So look, I take him at face value for his view on those. He said similar things about our allies in Asia. So I think he would pursue those things in a second term because he's unbound by the need to kind of play to a reelection, because there will not be another term after that. And so then the other big question becomes, who does he put in his cabinet? Myself and Mike Pompeo and John Bolton would talk him out of these things or at times when it came to funding Ukraine, trying to talk him into providing funding for Ukraine. So a key part here is one him, but the opposite side of the coin are who are the people he brings around him at both the Departments of State, Defense and elsewhere, but also in the White House because the people there have a big influence on him as well."
i198f6SxYRI,9889,Mark Esper,"I mean everybody in the alliance, but particularly the European countries who are nearby, you would think they would be far more alarmed and increasing rapidly their defense budgets to really meet the threat. This is where I give Japan credit, I think Prime Minister Kishida a couple years ago announced that Japan would double its defense spending from 1% to 2%, and you think about a 1% increase for a country that's the fourth-largest economy in the world, that's a big increase. And plus, they made decisions to acquire counterstrike land attack cruise missiles, big change from where their constitutional foundations have been with regard to these matters. So you see some countries taking it very, very seriously, and you see others not so, and I think we all need to have that collective sense that we are in a new era, we're going to have to get back to higher levels of defense spending no matter if we would prefer otherwise. And America and a few countries just can't carry all this weight. The voters just will not suffer that, and I think we'll talk about that, you'll see Trump tapping into that notion as well. Yeah, they need to do more, but they can't really ultimately do it without us either. So it's a- That's right. We need both to..."
j1riAkm-T59,10195,Mark Esper,"He certainly hasn't shown much instinct to go back towards, let's say, the Mark Esper, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence view of the world, and more of an instinct to double down on America First, and it's different, whatever that means, but it's different iterations. Don't you think, like the allies especially? Well, I've said this before, I talk about it in my book, and I think it's apparent now. When you see the polling, there are a lot of Republicans who want to see Trump reelected because they recall more favorable times than what they're seeing today. The Trump Administration pursued policy objectives that were consistent with what a lot of former conservative Republicans would've pursued as well, a conservative court, deregulation, lowering of taxes, an aggressive foreign policy. Trump sought to rebuild the military and did so for the first two or three years, securing the border, things like that. The challenge was that too often he would go too far. Look, I completely agree that we should push the allies in Europe, and Asia, by the way, to spend more on defense, to do more. But you don't go so far as to threaten to undermine NATO or to pull out, things like that. So again, I think in many cases his instincts were right. There were accomplishments during that administration, but there were guard rails in place, guard rail number one being the prospect of reelection, and number two being the people he brought in around him."
sqw6pYexd0F,10537,Mark Esper,"Trump did not take those lessons as well. Look, in many ways, things we were recommending pushing back against proved to be true. I often wonder whether he looks back and says, ""Thank goodness they were pushing back on me."" The best example is Afghanistan. Trump was constantly pushing to get out of Afghanistan, withdraw our troops. And as I talk about in a later chapter of my book, in October of 2020, before the election, he's going out there publicly buttressed by his national security advisor saying, ""We need to get out by Christmas,"" two months away, 2 1/2 months away, which was logistically impossible to do unless you left everything there and just put soldiers on planes and left, and we cautioned against that. I wrote a classified memo at the end of October saying we shouldn't go below 4,500 troops unless the Taliban does this or that or this or that. I've said publicly that I thought we should have used military pressure to get them to abide by the agreement. If not, we could have returned forces. But anyway, so the bottom line is we talked him out of a rapid precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan only to see what, 7, 8, 9, 10 months later Biden do the exact same thing, a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan."
qM4M6BS0TJ8,6974,Aaron Friedberg,"And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they've been, in my view, for the most part, the right thing to say. Are those now her genuine convictions and are they strong enough to enable her to push back against what I think is coming her way if she wins, which is we need to stabilize relations with China, we need to get a ceasefire because somehow we're going to get a peace settlement in the Middle East. Or I'm not sure exactly where that would come out on Ukraine. That we don't know, but I think the variance there is much narrower than the variance if it's Trump. And the downside, in my view, is much worse and more dramatic on the Trump side than it is on the Harris side. So if she wins, we'll be back to sort of normal debates about policy, foreign policy, defense policy, and I think we can survive that and live with that. If Trump wins, we're in a whole different world. In my view, it's likely to be a much darker one. Oh, that's good if somewhat bracing thing to end on."
hryKqwo-EIe,7166,Aaron Friedberg,"And that I think would be the most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens. That last sentence is so important. I want to get to it in a second, but I just did a podcast with my colleague, Tim Miller, who made a very good point I hadn't quite focused on, which is we take so much for granted that Trump behaves the way he behaves. I mean, how astonishing is it that he's with the head of a government that's fighting, of a nation that's fighting for its life against the brutal aggressor? We've been with it for, on its side, as almost the whole world has been really, the whole civilized world. And there's not a sentence that I could see, I skimmed the transcript also, of sympathy for Ukraine, of solidarity, of, ""Look, we so admire what you and your citizens have been doing."" You could then say, if you wished, ""We may have to, I'm not sure we can get the maximum war aims that you hope for."" And sometimes he has to make compromises you don't want to make. But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think."
kdL3MM4VmDF,7819,Aaron Friedberg,"That seems to me highly unlikely. He's expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything. So that would be the first set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one domain has an effect on others. I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely."
pHltv3Sf0XV,6756,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely. What are our friends and allies in Asia going to make of this outcome? And they've been very blunt now, Japanese leaders in particular, but Taiwanese too, saying, ""We have a stake in the outcome of this war between Ukraine and Russia because what happens there today could happen in Asia tomorrow."" So what would be the responses to that? I suppose you could say they're going to cling even more tightly to the United States, and maybe in the first instance that would be true, but I think the leaders of Japan, Korea, Taiwan too, would be foolish if they didn't consider the possibility that they too at some point might be hung out to dry. And they would have to think seriously about how they could defend themselves under those circumstances. And one obvious answer to that question is to acquire their own nuclear weapons. South Korean- there's been an open discussion about that in South Korea and Japan. It's more of a taboo subject, but less than it once was. So there are kind of quieter conversations about that going on."
WKwe_Sd7g6g,7345,Aaron Friedberg,"But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think. Yeah, and praising them for standing up for their freedom and fighting, even when, I mean, it could have been critical of the Biden administration saying that initially they didn't believe that Ukraine could defend itself, but of course, Trump himself had taken a similar view. Again, I haven't read the full transcript, but the bit that I saw that referred to the war and the consequences talked about all the buildings that had been knocked down. And he says something like, ""If they hadn't done this, these buildings would still be standing, then they'd be there for 2,000 years,"" or something like that. So yeah, I didn't see anything there. Praising Ukraine for its resolve, praising Ukrainian democracy for rallying its people to defend their own government and their own territory, sympathy for the losses. He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject."
B7kUJ4sm2g6,6729,Aaron Friedberg,"And of course, that's not the way the world really works. So if you imagine a world in which the US pulls back its support from Ukraine, presumably our European allies might at least for some period of time try to fill that gap. And I think they've been thinking about how they could do it and whether they could do it, but I don't think anybody believes that they could in the long run do that on their own. So imagine a world in which the Russians have successfully conquered all of Ukraine. I mean, you don't have to conjure up nightmarish notions of what would happen. We've seen what happens in territory that Russia takes from Ukraine. There's mass murder, there's deportations, forced deportations, kidnapping of children, destruction of industrial capacity. It would be nightmarish, and you would have an outpouring of refugees, and you'd also have Russian forces sitting that much further to the west and on the border of US friends and allies. So the consequences in Europe and Putin emboldened, presumably, by his success, he would be able to say, ""I, just like past great Russian leaders,"" maybe he wouldn't invoke Stalin, but that's clearly who he would have in mind, ""took a punch, but we Russians don't give up, and we mobilized our industry and mobilized our people, and we won this great victory."" Does anyone think that he then is going to be content and isn't going to cast his eye to the Baltics or even cast his eye further to the west?"
mZx9NewtllC,7023,Aaron Friedberg,"That doesn't seem to have happened directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we're going to see this problem grow and take different forms, but it isn't going to go away. There will continue to be terrorism, terrorist attacks on targets in the region and outside the region, conceivably. Yuck. Meanwhile, the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years is going ahead. It's not ceased or even diminished in intensity, really. Yes. And I gather the Russians are slowly, slowly making progress. Ukraine has conducted this counteroffensive, which continues into Russian territory. But there's no sign there of any kind of decisive outcome in either direction. I guess there was hope some time ago that the Ukrainian forces might be able to roll back the Russians. And I think, for the most part, people have given up on this thought, at least for the foreseeable future. So is this headed for some kind of a stalemate? What might break the stalemate? To what extent would the United States and others support Ukraine in taking action that could conceivably have that effect, even at the risk of escalation with Russia? So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons."
yjBG_kdtcYg,6842,Aaron Friedberg,"Yes. And I don't think we're going to see the cycling through more traditional figures who will then get fired or quit after six months, 12 months, 18 months. It just doesn't seem like that's likely for one thing because most of those people have been eliminated. But there are, if you go down the list and think of people, Robert O'Brien or Pompeo or people have mentioned Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio... At least before Trump came on the scene, I would've said those people were all kind of traditional hardline, Reagan-type Republicans. And to varying degrees, when they've spoken on some of these issues, they've continued to take that kind of position, always being careful, of course, not to contradict Trump or not to be critical of him. So that's a cast of characters who could conceivably emerge or some of those people could emerge. We don't know what their views would be once they were in office. What we do know is that ultimately they would have to do what Trump wanted them to do or they would be out. But at least at the outset, it's possible that you could have a Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, National Security Advisor, who again, at least based on their expressed views, might appear to be more, how to say it?"
RMFn4EuQLlp,6776,Aaron Friedberg,"So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons. And also providing more of them to Ukraine, conceivably, along with others in Europe. There's a fair amount of people singing up to do that, which could move things in one direction, which would have its own effects in terms of Putin, I suppose. Or the opposite, obviously, if Trump were to win and try to insist on some kind of negotiated settlement. So anyway, though, very unpleasant stalemate, not even a stable stalemate, if I can put it that way. No, I don't think it's reached that point. And therefore, in part for that reason, both sides clearly want to keep on. They haven't reached the point where they've both suffered enough pain and paid enough of a price that they're willing to consider some kind of ceasefire or try to come to some negotiated settlement. I don't see that in the offing. As you say, and maybe we come back to this, there are those two branches, question of whether the U.S. and others would assist the Ukrainians in escalating in some way that might have hope of bringing about a more successful outcome."
1WZQuiVg9lr,6926,Aaron Friedberg,"He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject. And that is revealing because I think that is the way he looks at it. And if that becomes the first kind of big fork in the road he faces as president, which I guess it might, support for Ukraine, you just said a word about the ramifications elsewhere. So say something about that. It's not as if these things, they do have an effect, even if he thinks he's going to be status quo and with respect to China for six months or something like that. Well, and this is one of the problems I have, again, with people who are trying to put forward a coherent alternative to policies that the current administration has been pursuing or alternative grand strategies, Asia First, that kind of thing, as if you could take this piece off the board and ignore it or somehow that it would take care of itself and everything else would remain the same. And of course, that's not the way the world really works. So if you imagine a world in which the US pulls back its support from Ukraine, presumably our European allies might at least for some period of time try to fill that gap."
63MOb35d0r6,9386,Robert Kagan,"His first and really only issue in 2011 was the birther conspiracy. And when he comes out on the birther conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. So he summoned them to him immediately, and then he displayed all the characteristics that such demagogues have always displayed, including his crudeness and... He is a violator of all the norms, and it is precisely because of his violation of all the norms that he has this following because they see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America, that he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large. Yeah, that's good. I mean, the use of extra-legal forces and threats and even some terror, that's not... I mean, these are not the historians I've read much of, but I think labor historians would say that that's happened quite a lot on the management side in the late 19th century, and it wasn't a trivial part of the attempt to keep unions and working men under control. And then as God knows, there's a lot of ethnic violence and so forth."
z1Mo2ogvT8I,8648,Robert Kagan,"He's made it very clear. I really don't understand. Too many people do not seem to understand that if Trump wins, there was going to be a bigger target on their backs than they are used to in this America. And from official forces, maybe either federal or tolerated forces at the state and local level with sympathetic governors or mayors obviously, but also the vigilante forces. I mean, you mentioned people not being punished. That's a part of American history obviously, and the kind of collusion you might say of the vigilantes and the law enforcement and official forces. Absolutely. I'm very struck with people have not made enough. I think Amanda Carpenter, who used to be with us at The Bulwark and is now at Protect Democracy, has made this point. Trump says in every speech that he's against qualified immunity for police officers, which I think a lot of people think actually is too much immunity, honestly, in terms of holding them accountable, but whatever. And he's for absolute immunity as he is for himself as president, for police officers, basically. They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments."
LKL3MvQHqP0,8149,Robert Kagan,"It isn't just steady progress. And what undid that triumph of white anti-liberalism were events, not just education, or not even... people didn't change. The Depression discredited the Republican and conservative movement, followed by World War II, which discredited racism, and really led to a huge flowering of liberalism in the wake of what had been a very dominant anti-liberal 1920s. Your discussion of the Klan is so interesting. I just had never focused. I assumed it was still southern, still race-focused as it had been in the 1880s and '90s and all. And it still is somewhat that way, but the degree to which it's strong in the north, strong nationally, as you point out in the book, and you quote people contemporaneously at the time, unselfconsciously, incidentally. Not embarrassed about it. It's sort of like today, you say, ""I'm proud to be MAGA."" You know? Right. And they were happy to be in the Klan. And it was a networking thing and so forth. The whole '24 Democratic Convention turns on a refusal, if I'm not mistaken, to repudiate the Klan by one of our two major parties. Right, right. The Democratic Party could not repudiate the Klan. And so all that's happening, and Americans are capable of living in a society where that kind of prejudice is rampant."
t2GkntNbT9c,8199,Robert Kagan,"But in terms of this kind of anti-liberalism all in the Republican Party, so that even though this portion of the population is actually shrinking, whites are shrinking as a proportion of the party, obviously white Protestants are shrinking as a proportion of the country, I should say, in the Republican Party they're an increasingly large force to the point where I think that the leadership can't ignore them anymore. So it's that national sorting, which leads to the strange predicament that we're in right now. It's the fact that all of the anti-liberals in the South and in the North are all in the Republican Party at this point. Whereas FDR could sort of balance the Southerners and the Northern ethnic groups and machines, and then in the Republican Party you could get a Willkie, or a Dewey, or an Eisenhower to beat back the other forces. What you're saying in a way is that beneath that sort of consensus, what's the difference between Willkie and Roosevelt, or Eisenhower and Stevenson, or Kennedy and Nixon? There's some truth to that I guess, or whatever, but beneath that surface consensus, there's stuff under the surface that we sort of tend to slide over in our normal histories. Right. And well, we don't slide over it, we just don't take them very seriously."
NsvOjc2DiDX,8473,Robert Kagan,"In what way is Donald Trump not an elite? In what way is Steve Bannon not an elite? Populism also suggests that a lot of it is economic. At least traditionally in American history, populist movements have sought, basically, fundamentally economic goals. And I don't think... I don't think, I'm quite confident that this rebellion, just as in the South before the Civil War and later, this rebellion is not about economics. It's about the definition of what America is. Yeah. That's so interesting and important because this does make your book, I think, distinct from a lot of the other books, some of which are good books, on this phenomenon. I think a lot of people might argue, ""Well, it is a populist reaction. It's not fundamentally thought through. It's not fundamentally grounded as much as you're saying in a kind of tradition or a self-conscious understanding. There's some elites who've glommed onto it but..."" I've been struck by this too, though, talking to... the degree to which the conventional view of Trumpism is white working class resentments, ignoring most of the leaders and energizing forces of Trumpism who are not resentful. Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies."
inrsAXSzISD,8528,Robert Kagan,"We can't really control what happens. Yeah. Well, and that was the view, don't tell the south what to do. They have to deal with their world, their way, et cetera, et cetera. That's what Buckley was arguing in the '50s and '60s. But we've had a federal government that has seen it as its job, if some cop shoots a Black person, to see whether that requires some kind of trial, and cops have been tried and convicted. That doesn't have to happen. That requires a real determination to make it happen. Throughout most of American history, cops like that were never punished. They were applauded in some cases. It doesn't take... Again, people are like, the jack boots don't need to be marching down the street for America to change very fundamentally from where it is right now. The fact that there are certain minority groups that don't seem to be conscious of the fact that it's definitely going to be turned on them. As I watch the protesters, and I don't even want to get into the justice or lack of justice of their protests, but the fact that people who are sympathetic to Muslims would think that Biden is worse than Donald Trump when we know what Donald Trump is going to do as far as American Muslims are concerned."
Lbw16rUvnpK,8267,Robert Kagan,"I mean, people like that are just being cowards. But your average Republican voter, who I think is probably a white... Even a white suburban male in particular does not feel that he's going to really lose out in this other system, whatever it's going to be. I mean, the counterargument would be that they think, he thinks, maybe incorrectly, that the guardrails will still kind of hold, sort of like the first term and that it won't change America as much as you're saying it would. No, I get that. And I've never claimed that I'm 100% certain that Trump is going to introduce a dictatorship, but I think any honest person would say the risk is high. Even if there's a 20% chance that Trump will do all the things he says he's going to do, isn't that too much of a risk to take? And then they have to convince themselves or convince us, or whoever's listening that somehow Biden is a bigger threat to the republic than Trump. I don't believe any normal person, any reasonable person could come to that conclusion. And so you have to ask, how sincere is that belief and how much is it that they're just cool with Trump? I just think we have to face that possibility. I mean, the in-between stage, and I guess students of the psychology of authoritarianism and stuff and authoritarian movements have really studied this a lot, is a kind of wishful thinking where you don't quite have to..."
GTUGKi42-41,8587,Robert Kagan,"Right, right. The Democratic Party could not repudiate the Klan. And so all that's happening, and Americans are capable of living in a society where that kind of prejudice is rampant. And I think that we just think that we grew out of it. And I think this is where we just can't imagine that people are still like that. And I think that to me, that's the big problem that we face intellectually, which is liberals, and I think we are all product of the Enlightenment to some extent, and we have this idea of inevitable progress. And we have this idea that human beings, over time... this is sort of the Frank Fukuyama thesis, which, Frank is hardly alone in feeling this way, that over time people will understand what liberalism requires. They'll become liberal. They'll realize that their prejudices are misplaced, et cetera, et cetera. I think the reality is different. I think the reality is that very few people really changed their mind that much. And there are always groups that feel the way that people who supported the Klan did, but they're oppressed or repressed or suppressed in various different ways. By Civil War, by... Eisenhower had to send the troops to Little Rock. The south was in full rebellion after Brown v. Board of Education, 1954."

You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments. They're in sheriff's offices and all kinds of things. And then you combine that with the pardon power, that's pretty far down the road, isn't it, away from liberalism? I mean, it's sort of like the definition of not being liberal, is cops can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be and vigilantes can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be, or some powers that want to be. It doesn't even have to be the powers that are quite in power yet. Right. Trump is going to play on the fact that even in the center of American politics, people are anxious about crime, although I think the statistics don't bear it out, but nevertheless, it's clear that if you're a Democrat in a city these days, you have to be tough on crime. So when Trump comes in and wants to be tough on crime, he is hardly going to be swimming against the tide."
yHAambRglpP,9282,Robert Kagan,"Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies. Right? Right. And the one thing that... Trump is able to amass a pretty broad coalition precisely because his policies have nothing to do with economics. So he's not threatening, for instance, to take money away from rich people, or even very well-to-do people in general, and give it to a working class movement. He doesn't really offer any economic answer to those in the working class. What he offers to them is revenge. What he offers to them is sympathy and support for what is effectively white anxiety. And whenever you say, ""It's the working class that supports Trump."" It's the white working class that supports Trump. The non-white working class does not support Trump, overwhelmingly in the other direction. And so I just think intellectuals in America are heavily influenced by economic and ultimately Marxist interpretations of how society works. And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that."

Now he's caught in a vice because he said he would do it on Fox. She said fine. She made the date specific. And I think that's the kind of infighting that you got to do. And I think it'd be pretty effective. Yeah, that sounds interesting. And then they end up debating, you think? Eh...You know I'm not very good... It is going to be a lot of heat. It's going to give her... Giving your opponent an answer to everything. ""Well, why didn't he say it to my face?"" And she said that at first. That's something that we used in... ""Hey, if you got something to say about me, you son of a bitch, say it to my face."" You've heard that growing up. I mean that's as common as anything. It's particularly common in middle America. So as long as he does not debate her, she has a classic answer to anything that's thrown at her. And he's instinctive enough to realize this. He's got a lot to risk either way. I would much rather be her than him. And of course, she also has another kind of built in advantage. She'd kind of be judged against Biden's June the 27th performance, which is..."

Was it three weeks now? Seems like 300 years? No, I think just two and a half, maybe. Two- It was on a Sunday, [inaudible]. Two weeks and two days, yeah. We're talking Tuesday the 6th, I think. So far, she has done nothing to dampen people's enthusiasm, she hasn't done anything remotely dumb, so I have reason to actually be encouraged. She looks like she's really grown, and people would tell me that. That's one thing I will say is people internally would say, ""James, she's different. She's more confident,"" and not just White House staff people, people that would go in there. Economists, historians, the same people go in and out of the White House. It doesn't matter who's in there. To a person that would all say she's very confident and asks very good questions and seems to be well briefed. I'm happy that she's like this.

First time somebody dropped out, first time they had a debate in June. So something tells me we're going to see a lot more first here. We're not done with first. We should have a running list of, ""First time..."" Blank. And it was the first... Very obvious, first time a woman's been ahead of a ticket or first time...

Speaking of VP candidates, I have a hunch that Vance could hurt actually the Trump ticket a little more than people think. Normally, VPs don't matter much as we've been... I think that's the conventional wisdom, except maybe for '92 I think where you guys were helped by the Gore pick. And '80, which I do think Bush helped Reagan as a kind of taking the edge off the charge of extremism. But do you agree that Vance is weird enough to use Walz's term that it not only doesn't help Trump but could actually hurt him? Well, I do because I don't think we're through finding out things about JD Vance. Okay. As I say, I think there are more shoes in that closet. And like today he gave a book blurb to Jack Posobiec. Oh, that guy. Yeah. I mean, all right, this is some [inaudible] stuff, dude. Let me tell you. And I know people ask me to do a book blurb and I'm very generous about book blurbs. No, this is like, you do the basic stuff. So somebody say, ""Hey, James. I'm professor of political science at UCSD, and can you do a book blurb?"" And I'll look up the guy and okay, he looks all right."

I mean, I kind of expected them to really come out of the box with stuff on her that from 2019, if only those, what she said then to really dump a lot of... spend a lot of money in the swing states. But maybe she's just had so much momentum that it didn't penetrate. She's had a very good two weeks. But do you agree that the Trump campaign's had a not very good two weeks?

If you know, that is always kind of bothered me that we are a little too coastal. And it's fresh water, they decided on fresh water and not salt water. And it is basically that simple I think. But my number one pick would've been Beshear, but so be it. Yeah, I feel like that gets you a lot of the... but, whatever. It gets you a [inaudible]. But Walz, I'm so on this train and blowing the whistle and we'll rolling. This is the choice and let's roll. Final question. Speaking of VP candidates, I have a hunch that Vance could hurt actually the Trump ticket a little more than people think. Normally, VPs don't matter much as we've been..."
HvkJLx7F5Yp,10116,James Carville,"But this is more... You can't use a historical benchmark to talk about this because debates have now taken on near legendary status in American politics. Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out. I was thinking about this the other day, and this is not a criticism, I think it's the first ticket in modern times since the modern primary system came into being where both candidates on one ticket, in this case on the Democratic ticket, and neither of them has ever gotten a vote in a Democratic primary for president, that is every race we've all been involved in or watched... In the early days, they only had a few primaries, Humphrey and all that. But still every nominee in both parties had gotten some primary votes, certainly from '72 on. '76 on, let's just say. And mostly had won the primaries. And then the VP nominees had often run and gotten at least some primary votes, especially if they were the losing candidate. Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list."
8TH5NrKWFf4,9263,James Carville,"Intelligent people who follow politics, which is they sort of think, ""Well, you're losing this county so you got to focus on the other counties."" But of course, a vote you pick up in a statewide, this isn't true of congressional districts, but in a statewide race, losing... If you had two counties the same size, let's just do it like that to make it easy. Picking up a point in the county you're losing 66/34 counts exactly the same as picking up a point in the county you're winning 80/20, right? I mean, you know- It actually is more, I'll tell you. So, I'll go through the thinking, but you're dead on, spot on. What we would do is we were very much into finding videos of Trump. We wanted to be the John Stewart video vault archive, and what we realized is that it really didn't matter that much. So, then we sat down and we would look at Cambria County, Pennsylvania and Hillary lost it, I don't have exact numbers right in front of me. Maybe she lost 78/22. And we said, ""Man, if we could lose this thing 74/26 in Blair County and Luzerne County,"" and you go through the whole laundry list of them, then you would really in effect change sea level. That was our total thinking and that we could get much more bang for..."
4Uuvkx0rGqI,9182,James Carville,"How would you advise her to deal with that? Either 2019 and/or 2020. There's a minor fact, and I would bring it up. The crime rate since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's second office has plummeted. Yes, historic numbers. I don't quite know what you're talking about, but we took over a high crime country under the administration of Donald Trump, which by the way, became a high crime country under the administration of Donald Trump. I think we can definitely talk about that. The Democratic-parts of the Democratic Party, not Joe Biden, not Democratic primary voters, decidedly not-lost their minds. And everybody thought this was the wave of the future. The identity politics is being essential to any discussion of politics. And of course it was a giant mistake. She bought into that. As did other people. Whoever advised her in 2019, I hope to throw them all out in the Pacific Ocean. And to a guy like me, you could see this coming. So I went backed and looked in April 27th, 2021, I did an interview on Vox and I said, ""This stuff is killing us. This is the dumbest thing that you can imagine."" And I'll give myself credit. I was right. I call ""defund the police"" the three stupidest words in the history of the English language."
qMxkgTqKSsn,10493,James Carville,"And when you watch him, that rally in Georgia I think is significant because he didn't fill it up and he blamed Georgia State- a well-known liberal, coastal, elite institution. But the people were walking out and his reaction is, ""I got to keep them. I'll just get crazier."" And so he's like Brian Kemp. Okay, who's you know, Brian Kemp is Karl Rove's kind of wet dream of what a modern Republican should be. And he's just like savaging the guy. You could see he's trying to do anything he can to keep the crowd and keep them on their feet and keep them motivated. And like I say, he's an old comedian. Punchlines just don't work like they used to and he's just struggling. And do you think it'd be hard for him to regain his balance? I mean, it's hard to know, right? All I can say is we need to do everything we can to keep him off his balance, not predict if he can get his balance back. And I think the debates are golden opportunities because he doesn't want to do it. He does not want do it. He's got too much at risk. It's a multiracial female that he's got to go against and Vance is going to have to debate Walz and Walz is going to..."

But I think every little word is going to count in this, and I think recovery is one of those words that can help him. James, thank you for this conversation. Thank you for all this good advice to president and his team. Thank you all for all the fricking work you're doing. Tim liked my last video. He told me, ""Play it on the show."" That's good. That's good. But we'll get together after the debate, or the non-debate, on June 27th and do an analysis of how the whole thing's been turned around by your council to the president. And it's a good start to the day in the Pacific time zone. Thank you, James. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations."
RTJlMErQwTU,9767,James Carville,"Bill Clinton thinks, if I can just get in front of the bank president, I can convince him. Sir, you're not going to convince him. Guy's been a Republican since before he was born, okay? And I think Trump has that... I'd hate to equate anybody with Trump, but I think he's got that kind of salesman optimism about him. If you just get me in front of these people, ""the Blacks, they love me."" Yeah. And again, it only has to work with like one out of 20, right? It's not like he has to convince massive numbers. Yes. We're dealing in a universe of fairly small tolerances here. There's some sort of custom to taking a porn trip and your approval goes up 5%. That'll convince you. The things we talked about, they just don't, they don't happen anymore. I guess the one thing that will happen, maybe we can close in a minute on this, I thank you for taking all this time, is I guess he will make a VP pick. That's traditional. Do you have any view on both what Trump's going to do and should do? It's one of the few things that's going to happen this summer that's actually different. What he's going to do on what? The vice presidential pick for Trump."
XV4F0ue4k5d,11088,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
en8Yv47kw1U,9301,James Carville,"They had him eating pudding with his fingers. And the story is she was the big operative. She made him. He was this guy with no personality and she got him elected to Congress. He was not supposed to win for governor. She got him elected governor. And then Mrs. DeSantis turned on her and drove her right to Mar-a-Lago, and Ron DeSantis ain't been the same since he's [inaudible] with Ms. Wiles, I promise you. When this all emerges... and I don't even think I know her. Her daddy was like, Pat Summerall, was a big time sports announcer. Right. I got to tell you, from a distance, man, that woman wields a really effective knife. Phew. No, I think that's important, and I do think they're kind of underestimated. So, Trump goes to the South Bronx for that 4,000 person rally the other night after the trial. And then- And everyone's ridiculing him up there. -the two felons up there. What's that? The two felons. Yeah. He had the felons, so that was a little lunatic. Yeah. But everyone was ridiculing him on the Democratic Biden campaign. He's going to a place he can't win, New York. And what's he wasting his time for? I feel like that was pretty effective. He showed that he's willing to go anywhere."
ZRgG9vNPkKU,10369,James Carville,"They have to be very, very careful how he's deployed and they have to husband him pretty closely. And I can't fault them for that, but yes sir, how are you going to address him? Yeah, that's a good point. But in the meantime, you can use paid media and stuff to really remind people. But the big thing is going to be the jury. If there's a conviction, how those jurors come across is going to have a lot to how much people accept this verdict. Yeah, that's interesting. And if Trump loses it, which he might and attacks the jury, I feel like that's an opportunity also to say he's attacking these Americans who are doing their duty. Right? Right. If these jurors, what I'd give to prepare one of them for Sunday morning TV. First of all, collectively, this jury took 21,250 hours out of their lives. We listened to X... 28,000 words of testimony. We sat there and observed every witness. We conscientiously went through every document, and we could arrive at no other conclusion but this. Boom. Boom. And who the jury is, who they elect foreman, how articulate she or he is. Yeah, it all depends a lot, but how that jury justifies what they did can have a lot of effect on public opinion, and we never really considered politics in this, to be honest with you."
i5S3Lc5sD1G,9906,James Carville,"I think Trump does not think it hurts him to have two males on the ticket. I think everyone thinks he's going to pick a woman or a minority, but I don't know that he... I think he has a sort of view which is pretty cynical, and we may not like it, but that two older white rich guys, that's kind of attractive to Republicans, and it's not that unattractive to a certain type of swing voter who thinks, well, those guys know what they're doing. They're business guys, they're et cetera. Tough guys. He seems pretty intent that he's going to do it his way. He's telling you, ""We're not going to have any of this General Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn. We're not going through that anymore."" He's really laying the groundwork to say, ""I ran on this. I told you I was going to do this. Now I'm going to do it."" And I could see somebody saying, ""Well, if you pick another white male, you're going to get a lot of flack."" And he said, ""That's exactly the kind of flack I want."" That may be just what he wants to do. And I'm not doing it like you tell me to do it. I'm doing it my own way. And by the way, he'll have a point if he wins."
yvexKvcDoMq,9312,James Carville,"Well, yeah, I guess if an average American did that, I would think. Because that's just not an everyday occurrence in America, is it? When you stop and you think about it, I'm sure I wasn't there for closing, but I'm sure the prosecution argued, look, the law entitles you to certain information before you make a decision. That's your right, the law grants that to you, and he hid that from the American people who were the real victims here. If it didn't matter, then if it was public, then people could easily conclude that it didn't matter. But they weren't given that choice. Because of Mr. Trump's duplicity, that was hidden from people, which they had a right to know. I think if you make that argument, the fraud that was perpetrated was on the people, on the voter, I think that'll take you a longer way. Yeah, that's good. That's good. And it is also good to talk about the facts of the case. Well, I don't know if the average American did this and you go through it and go, Jesus did all that happen? Yeah, it all happened. That would be something if on June 27th Biden says what you just said, that would be a memorable moment in American presidential politics. Yeah, like I say, the Republicans have, I mean, first of all, your group, which is can't say enough good about the way that y'all understand the threat ahead and let's don't whine and complain."
SREk8R85AKC,10672,James Carville,"We had terrible disaster in Lebanon and the fall of '83 with the Marines being killed. But one got the sense... I mean, he acknowledged it and then he pivoted very quickly. And I'm not using that as an example. And Reagan, of course, everyone cites, is too much. He's too high a standard, I suppose, on a political scale, but it feels like they could be more decisive, whichever course he chooses to take. Or even if he chooses to change course. Yeah, I remember '83, the [inaudible] you know? I actually think he was too willing to move on. I think some people really screwed that up. I agree totally. Yeah. But he got beyond it. That's undeniable. But there was some... look, there's no more massive act of negligence on a part of any nation since World War II than there was about Israeli government on October 7th. That's just staggeringly... and so much of that was a result of hubris, of thinking we had everything under control, it was all done. And boy, when you look back at how arrogant they were, you could see how something like this would happen. And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have?"
gbT2OkemPGe,10628,James Carville,"I am struck how much people just assume it's going to happen because Trump said he would do it. I assume Trump won't do it if he thinks it not in his interest. He said he was going to testify to trial. [Inaudible] he thought that. And you know what? When he didn't testify, it didn't cost him anything. There was very little... even, ""well sir, you said..."" so he'll say... he's already said, ""CNN can't host, they're not fair."" He's just going to brush it off and say, ""It can't be fair. I told Biden to take a drug test. He wouldn't take a drug test."" My answer would be, ""Will you give us the records that Keith Schiller stole from Dr. Bornstein in 2017 that no one's ever asked you about it? You went in his office, the doctor said he felt like he was raped, sent your goons in there and be glad to, you release those health records."" But he doesn't pay. He's paid zero price for not testifying his own path. None. And from that, he's learned, I can do what I want. I can back out of a debate. What are they going to do to me? I mean, do you think though that Biden literally every day for the next month just says, in the course of discussing whatever issue he's discussing, ""I very much look forward to debating Donald Trump on this."

That was the moment that I said, oh man, this guy can't win no matter what he does. Well, but I think you think he could win. I mean it's maybe slightly less than fifty-fifty. What about the timing? So it's the end of May. We have this debate presumably on June 27th. Is that A, likely to happen in your view and B, is that actually a moment where people might focus in a big way as opposed to one speech here, one speech there kind of thing? So let's take something we know as a fact. Democrats have not lost since Kansas. This has happened. Maybe it has... I think somebody pointed out [inaudible]... Western Nebraska that we were supposed to lose about 23 and lost about seven. All right? So we know that. We know this tribe's voting day. If he's fortunate... I don't think Trump will go to the debate. And I base that on, he'll do anything that's not in his perceived self-interest. And this is one of these things where he could hurt... Biden has a chance to help himself. But let's say that he goes. If I were his debate coach, I would say that I am not outsourcing Supreme Court picks."
ICx8FxvgCtI,3603,Eric Edelman,"So in Riyadh, the Saudis promised $600 billion in investment, the Qataris offered I think 1.2 billion, and then the Emiratis offered about 200 billion in AI deals, joint investments in artificial intelligence, which total up to roughly $2 billion worth of trade and investment. I want to come back to those numbers in a second. But Trump has said now a couple of times in different fora that he went and he got $4 trillion, not 2 trillion, 4 trillion or $5 trillion. So his hyperbole, his need to exaggerate and that he got this personally, when a lot of this was business deals that were already sort of underway, company-to-government or government-to-government entities, were already engaged in all of this. So one of the things that's very hard to parse when you look at the fact sheets is how much of this is going to be actually accomplished in Trump's term? How much of this is new? How much of it actually began before he arrived on the scene? He seems to be aware of this slightly because he's also told the press that some of this is going to come to fruition after he's left office and other people are going to take credit for it. He said, ""But you guys have to remember, I'm the one who did it."
seNqRFtrW79,3644,Eric Edelman,"Because China, of course, much larger data, can suck up a lot more data from its billion people than we can. So there is an argument for that at one level. But as you say, Congress, the Select Committee on Competition with China and the Congress formerly co-chaired by Raja Krishnamoorthi and Mike Gallagher, those folks have always been concerned about this and we'll have to see. I mean, as you say, UAE, Dubai is notoriously a leaky place for the transfer of technology to whoever, and that's something that's obviously going to have to be watched as time goes on so that it doesn't go to China. We'll see how much interest the administration has in watching it though. I was struck, you commented, and we've talked about it as the trip was happening, by the appearance Wednesday, and I guess this was in Qatar, if I've got the country's order correct, of the Syrian, the new head of Syria. What do you make of that and what was that about? So it was actually... The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria."
XRI6ElZFZFo,3769,Eric Edelman,"The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria. We had put in place an enormous number of sanctions on individuals and entities in Syria as a result of the very destructive 15 year long Syrian Civil War, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, created a massive outflow of refugees from Syria and internally displaced people in Syria. And this was done, the president said quite openly, essentially at the behest of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and President Erdoğan of Turkey, both of whom have an understandable desire to see Syria stabilized after 15 years of violence that have wracked the country and disrupted the region. That's all understandable. And there is an argument that sanctions on Syria should be lifted, or at least some sanctions should be lifted. The question though is, first of all, this was done without any kind of deliberative policy process at all. In fact, the administration's counter-terrorism coordinator and Deputy National Security Advisor, Seb Gorka, just on the end of the day before the president left, was fulminating about, ""We're not going to lift sanctions on this jihadi president of Syria."" And there is a question about al-Sharaa because he does have a past link to jihad."
ny8gEYktGqi,4336,Eric Edelman,"I mean, his losses have been extraordinary and the rate of advance has been really very slow. I mean, they've been advancing but at a snail's pace and mostly dismounted infantry assaults, very hard for them to make up their losses in equipment and much less in personnel. They have lost, according to British MOD intelligence numbers that were posted earlier this month, something like 967,000 people, of whom about 200,000 have died, been killed in action. They will probably hit the million-casualty mark sometime this month or early June. Those numbers are astronomical and they're not really sustainable. If Putin has to calculate that he is pursuing this with continued US support, continued European support, maybe stepped-up European support, that's one thing. But if he's able to- For Ukraine. For Ukraine, yeah. But if he's got to calculate that it's going to be US supports going away, European support is kind of iffy, then he's going to be stepping up his operations and think he can drive Ukraine ultimately to capitulate, which seems to be his objective. And that I think would be catastrophic not just for Ukraine, but for European security and for NATO and for US leadership in the world. And by the way, the Chinese will be watching. But yes, to your point, I mean this is not a coherent kind of worldview and it's not sustained by any kind of deliberative process."
Pv3z4xrX__v,3842,Eric Edelman,"But he knew that going to the Middle East, where he had gone on his first trip in his first term, he would be greeted with sword dances and with, as you say, camels and Arabian stallions and red Cybertrucks and fighter escort for Air Force One and all of the trappings of power that he enjoys and the kind of adulation he requires psychologically, I think, in order to operate at a high functional level. So it was, from that point of view, a great place to start his foreign travels as president. Technically, actually.... Technically though, I think we have to note his first trip was actually to the funeral of Pope Francis. Oh. You're right, good point. Yeah, I missed that. I didn't think of that. So he went to three countries. Frankly, for a lot of Americans, and I'll put myself in that category, they slightly blur together since they're all next to each other and they're all similar backgrounds, you might say, but still very different actually in terms of their foreign policies and what happened in each of those countries. And I guess the order was Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE- United Arab Emirates. But since the headline of the trip became the plane, maybe we should begin with the famous, or infamous, Qatari 747."
iK2K3XlpNKp,3611,Eric Edelman,"He said, ""But you guys have to remember, I'm the one who did it. It was me personally."" So it's very hard to really get after these numbers. To give you one, for instance. In the Saudi portion of the trip, the fact sheet talks about $142 billion in arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Now, when he went on his first trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, they announced a 110-billion- dollar arms package, not all of which came to fruition. There have been questions that have already been raised about, well, exactly 142 billion's a lot of money for even the Saudis. Saudi defense budget is roughly 70 billion a year. So $142 billion is two year's worth of their defense budget. Byron Callan, who was a close observer of the defense industry and defense trade, has calculated that if you look out a decade and you factor in 3% annual real growth into the Saudi budget, 142 billion would be roughly 15% of what the Saudis spend over 10 years. Is that a reasonable wag at what the US might anticipate it would secure in arms sales? Yeah, probably. Maybe. And would that be a good thing? Yes, that would be a good thing because it'll tie the Saudis closer to us and allow us to have more influence."
ln52V4s5Ft3,3722,Eric Edelman,"Neither of those things happened. It's not clear that the president on his own can actually lift all of these sanctions. Some of them are imposed by legislation. Others, like taking Syria off the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, the so-called FTO, requires him to submit a report to Congress, which they then have to approve. So to say the least, there were a lot of T's that were left uncrossed and I's that were left undotted in all of this. Now, in the meeting with al-Sharaa, the president did ask, according to the readout from the White House, for some of the things we would want from a new Syria. One of which was, for instance, normalization with Israel, have Syria join the Abraham Accords and become another neighbor of Israel that has made peace with it, it would be like Egypt and Jordan and the UAE, Bahrain, other states surrounding Israel in the region. That would be a good thing. He asked for al-Sharaa to expel some of the foreign jihadis who helped al-Sharaa come to power, but who have since been engaged in intercommunal violence in Syria that has troubled observers who would like to see a stable Syria. He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations, to reintegrate them into the Syrian Armed Forces, and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who, if left untended, could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria."
jHJzuUDS4EQ,3726,Eric Edelman,"He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document. It's sort of, that's also, I suppose, the kind of transactionalism Trump likes, right? Pretty vague about exactly what's promised to whom, a lot of ability to rethink things later on. Maybe he will use the plane as a private citizen after he becomes president. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it. The whole thing has that ring to it. I was amused also, I'll just say, by the fact that it seems to be something they've been trying to dump for four years. No one wanted to buy it. It's both expensive and extremely, I guess, expensive to operate. God know what the expense will be for us to transform it into an actual functioning Air Force One with all the security and other considerations that that involves. But anyway, I think you're right. Yeah, that is the shakedown side. Well, say a word more about that though. Why would the Qatari, why would they be so eager to have Trump's backing or Trump's goodwill?"
IeuuxET5vv4,3657,Eric Edelman,"So I saw just before coming on with you a story, I think it was in Bloomberg, saying that Europeans are stunned by Trump's phone call in which he basically said, ""Great phone call. The two sides are going to get together to talk about a ceasefire."" Which people had called for already, and so now they're going to be... Instead of having a ceasefire and talking about a peace deal, now they're going to be talking about a ceasefire. The Russian readout of the call was a little different. It quoted Putin as saying, ""Well, we're going to talk about all this and see if we can reach agreement, but we have to deal with the root causes of all this."" And that's just code, in Putin speak, for an independent Ukraine oriented to the West with security guarantees, et cetera. Basically suggesting that he hasn't budged an inch from his minimalist demands. The Europeans are saying, after all the effort they've made in the last couple of weeks to tee up Trump to become irritated by Putin's unwillingness to actually come to the table despite Zelensky's frequently expressed offers to come to the table, that would then lead to some pressure or sanctions on Putin. Apparently in the phone call that the Europeans had with Trump after his phone call with Putin, they were stunned that he is unwilling to sanction Putin."
JRuyojfODX_,3589,Eric Edelman,"It started out more as a potential state-to-state transaction because of Trump's impatience to get a new aircraft as Air Force One. And the Qataris have been trying to unload a specially built 747 that they have for VIP travel for the emir, which is very expensive to operate. They've They unloaded one actually, according to The New York Times , as a gift to Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, because of Turkey's role standing by Qatar in its short-lived sort of embargo with Saudi Arabia and the UAE back in 2017. And they gave one away, they're trying to unload the other. And although initially they thought they would be leasing it or selling it to the United States government, somehow this morphed into it's going to be a gift to either Trump personally or actually to the government, but then it's going to go to Trump's library. It's all a little bit of a mystery how it morphed into this. But as Susan Glasser wrote, it's the perfect symbol for the trip because he has no doctrine. He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document."
-ZPRJ5W4Los,8302,AB Stoddard,"He wants people to go into red areas. He worked construction, he served in the military. He knows what it's like to struggle to find healthcare coverage, to get a job where that would be provided. He basically, he says, you can't go to Walmart and buy a Carhartt jacket, a Carhartt boots, and show up at an event and try to talk to working class people and win them back from Trump. You have to be authentic. I've seen him repeat this message. I mean, this is somebody who's making an effort not only to get the message across to Democrats, but to become a voice for the Democrats. And so I think that kind of thing will spread. People have to take chances and they have to get out there. And Jasmine Crockett went viral on the oversight committee before Trump was reelected. So now she's running around trying to be a voice, and she made a mistake recently. So people are getting worried about that. People are worried also about having AOC and Bernie before facing because they're too liberal. That's all fine. But I think if you get out there and you carpet bomb in the face of the assault on our system that we're facing, something will stick. And that's why I think the idea of having some kind of rotating voices on a unified message, like my whiteboard idea is that you can get a mother who is affected in a measles outbreak one week and the next a senator."
IlmUWucPZRe,7596,AB Stoddard,"And that has gone much more smoothly for him, I think, than he thought it would. Yeah. Well, let's talk about that. We've talked about Trump. What about the resistance to Trump? I agree, none of us... I bet you could Google a million articles about a Trump second term and never see the term ""law firms."" That was not on people's radar screen that he's also going to go punish them, try to damage their business, threaten them existentially, the Paul Weiss guy claimed, and also get tens of millions of dollars of pro bono work that's friendly to him. Universities maybe we expected that a little more, I suppose. The businesses, not big tech stuff, we've all just taken that for granted now, but that was a big deal when it happened right after the election and pretty... Zuckerberg, Bezos, pretty striking. I mean, maybe we'll get to the Democratic party itself, the more political side of things in a few minutes, but what have we learned about America in terms of the resistance? Well, yeah, we'll get to Democrats afterwards. I see sort of the population and then the institutions of law, of acting, yeah. That's a good distinction... And they're different. I feel that we've seen with the law firms always and others, a lot of hands in the air saying, we're trying to protect our business."
_Duv7QLIny9,7570,AB Stoddard,"This I am slightly mystified by in the sense that why isn't in his political interest to spend more money on fighting cancer? I mean, that's sort of a classic. If you look at the other demagogues and authoritarians, they actually often do spend a fair... they try to be the person who's vaguely in favor of kind of solving these kinds of problems. They're not ideological problems and they can throw money at it. What do they care? So anyway, but it is striking that he' so... Elon in this respect may be doing damage politically to Trump and as well as to the country, who knows. But what about the Democrats? They're the opposition party. They should be blowing, calling, sounding these alarms and rallying the opposition. They're in the minority and you've studied Congress and covered Congress a lot, and you know how weak or weak that makes you, even if you're a very large minority, which they are relatively speaking in Congress, but I don't know. What's your judgment of the Democrats? Well, again, I mentioned before that I am just horrified at how much they wasted the transition, a leaderless party. That's so interesting. I hadn't really focused on the transition as a key moment. People have now focused- It's almost three months. Yeah... yeah, that they could have really gotten a lot of stuff lined up, right?"
00JQoJ57sQX,7497,AB Stoddard,"It's been November, December, January, February, March, five months. What strikes you, what surprised you? Well, when I was on Fox News panels in 2015 and 2016 and we were talking about the rise of Trump first, of course it wasn't taken seriously and our late great friend, Charles Krauthammer, I believe, called him a rodeo clown. So he was dismissed, but as he made gains, I continued to make the point that he would not ever hold the national interest in regard and that he didn't believe in a constitution or the courts or the Congress in separation of powers, and it was dismissed at the time as, ""Well, this is sort of his style, right? Isn't it fun, like the apprentice-y businessman, he wants it to be the Trump org, and that's great. That's how he runs his family business. Oh, well that's kind of his style."" And at the time, I could sense the danger in that, and if you really had watched his pathologies to put it mildly, it was clear that that would become very dangerous and that we were not, the US government was not to be his vanity project. And in the end he wins. You and I talked at length between '17 and '20. It was clear that he was trying to make the case, lay the pretense for the election to be stolen through the post office and other means should he lose."
Q3HPTmVUpcs,7684,AB Stoddard,"It was dominant on YouTube all day. Republicans are worried about it because they said, ""What is he doing just making a speech? Well, what's that, nobody cares."" People will care and that kind of thing will travel because Democrats are just looking, the voters are looking for some kind of response, some kind of a fight. So what I'm saying is I see a pickup between January 20 and April two. It's not good enough, but I see something is building in terms of people being willing to get out there. And of course they need resources, they need coordination. They need to stop fighting, they need to stop blaming, and I think they need to actually attack Trump's assault on five different subjects a day. I mean, they can't hide from any issue. And yeah, you can't jump at the news and that's what he wants you to do. And he throws out distracting things like Greenland and so you shouldn't follow that like a dog to the bone. But why can't they, I keep thinking, do a golden era or what does he called it? ""The golden age whiteboard,"" where they every day a different person, it's AOC one day, it's a businessman, small businessman from Kansas. The next week it's Mark Cuban. The week after that it's, I don't know somebody but maybe five numbers."
kKgZjQmLVTV,7463,AB Stoddard,"She's an outlier, obviously. I was really disappointed in their whole reaction to this national security breach, we'll call it, because they invited a civilian journalist into an insecure chat about war plans. And this ""Signal gate"" is just a little more than a week old, and Republicans looked the other way. Mike Turner, who's the intel chair on the house side, brought himself only to a TV studio to say, I guess this was courageous of him, that that information clearly would've been classified. But then he just said the way it was handled was so ""surprising."" He was deposed as house intel chair by Trump, basically at Trump's direction. Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Sorry. He wasn't, no, no, but I'm saying you're Former. Yeah, But that makes it even more astonishing. What does he owe Trump? I mean, he literally lost the job he cared the most about on The Hill. And that's what's kind of astonishing. I guess we'll close with this, just maybe do you think, I don't know, by September 30th, with all the drama with the budgets and Ukraine and NATO, there'll be a NATO summit. God knows what Trump will do there. Maybe we will begin to see-God knows you and I have spent eight years being disappointed to say the least by Republicans-but maybe at some point they snap a little bit, or as you said, maybe not even quite the ones who face primaries don't, but then there are others and maybe some candidates emerge somewhere who aren't simply, but maybe not, incidentally, the greed with which the whole party... to me it's just now whole generations of politicians who've made their way by being slavish imitators of Trump and lackies to Trump is, I guess we can't discount that."
rFDKFha1D_l,7837,AB Stoddard,"They were worried about him, but they didn't really go to the mattress on it. And then suddenly now it's like, oh my God, he's our worst fears. I mean, are we sufficiently appreciative of the fact that this lunatic is the secretary of HHS and is not, contrary to what people sort of thought, has not pulled back at all? And I mean, I'm a little freaked out about this. I have sort of secondary family relations, mostly on Susan's side, in medical and research science world. And I actually know some people in that world too from around here and New York, and I mean, this is bad, they think. And they're not hysterics. And incidentally, a lot of them have been critical of NIH... It's a bureaucracy, they don't always fund the right things. They have the usual gripes you have with big government agencies, but the degree of damage that's being done, and maybe voters don't understand if research on Parkinson's gets slowed down or eviscerated because you don't see the effect, exactly. You know what I mean? You don't see the progress that's not made. It's not like social security office being closed, but I really wonder how much that's going to percolate out through sort of Republican-ish voting groups, right? Physicians, executives and pharma companies."
m9fzm6JHU41,7917,AB Stoddard,"And watching Bill Cassidy, a serious man, senator from Louisiana, a doctor, struggle with that vote, knowing that RFK Jr has really promoted quack science and conspiracies for a long time. That he's anti-vaccine... Bill Cassidy's on the fence... was really, you could really see him turning himself into a pretzel and he ends up supporting him and now is going to call him before his committee to talk about all the firings and he's upset and concerned. That was all predictable. RFK Junior is a really troubled guy and really an unstable person who also just spews falsehoods. And so this was not something to take a chance on. All of this was predictable, and it's really quite enraging. Jonathan Rauch, who's a very well-known writer and will be known to people who listen to this, famously posted around 10 days ago that he had a friend who drove two hours for her breast cancer chemotherapy treatments that were part of an NIH trial only to arrive at the location to be told without any phone call or warning that it had been canceled. And there was no future plans for any new protocols or any new treatments for her. And this kind of thing is going to ripple out through people's lives, people who have kids with special needs, people who have diabetes, whatever it is."
97arSooszQv,7516,AB Stoddard,"And I guess we'll see if they go in that direction. And also knock Trump's-let's get to the Republicans and close with them-but if they knock Trump's numbers down, the argument's always been maybe you get four Republican senators, four Republican house members to jump ship on some votes at least. And then you start to get some fractures in the Republican party. And that does have, I can say this, having been in government, that has an effect on the governing party. I mean, if you start to have to worry about your own members and just the image of losing some of these votes, losing some of your members legitimates concerns among the citizenry. Like, ""Well gee, even these Republicans are worried about what Trump is doing on issue X Bill Cassidy-type thing."" And so anyway, do you think that's practical though? If his numbers get knocked down some, if the Democrats get more energized and use your whiteboard and more effective, do Republicans ever defect? I don't think so because they're only looking out for their primaries and that hasn't changed. So until and unless people stop threatening them in their driveway and on the phone and online, I mean these are real threats to their security if they go against Trump and then they to win their next primary and hold their seats."
Noe7Pi5fSMG,7496,AB Stoddard,"So until and unless people stop threatening them in their driveway and on the phone and online, I mean these are real threats to their security if they go against Trump and then they to win their next primary and hold their seats. There's no reason for Susan Collins not to retire. She didn't have to vote for RFK junior. She is going to be in cycle again in '26, and she's going to be 74 and she wants to run until she's 80. She's had a wonderful career of standing up for the right things and bucking her party. She could just retire now and continue to oppose what she thinks is wrong. So that concerns me that they're not going to step back. I want to say another thing about the Democrats. I think it's really important because of what we started with, which is the authoritarian project and how it's structured and how you break down these institutions and centralize your power. They need to start talking about Trump in this third term right now. And he did release an executive order recently, and it doesn't really matter what the terms were, but we can get into that, basically dictating to states how they should make these changes to their electoral systems. The federal government doesn't run elections, states do and localities do."
jkPwysSlFkK,4681,David Axelrod,"He's an effective demagogue and he's a good entertainer, in his own way, and I agree with you, he's in a way a little crazier than he was, but he is also better, in some ways, at being a demagogue than he was, because he's really discovering what works. He's good. Listen, no one should underestimate Donald Trump. That's always been my keep. He's a feral genius- Yeah. ...that is very, very clear. And even the stuff that we're all... I'm appalled that he put a target on the judge's daughter's back over the weekend and published her photograph, because there are crazy people out there. I'm worried about another Paul Pelosi situation- Yeah. ...where someone is motivated by all of this. That said, what he's doing is he is doing what he always does. He knows that he is at risk of being convicted in this trial in New York, and he's branding it. He's branding the whole event as a partisan, as he would call it, witch hunt and so on, and he's just going to do that relentlessly, just as he did by the way he branded the 2020 election in advance. Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months."
s4g9bZiiRNe,3858,David Axelrod,"But this is a real thing, and Biden's not getting the credit for what he has done. He's getting the blame for more than he should, but it is the lot of being President of the United States at a time of war. Yeah, this is the incumbent... Sarah finds it, [inaudible] finds this a lot in the focus groups. The world seems chaotic, and Biden doesn't seem to be on top of this now. Yeah, that's what I said at the beginning. That's a Republican message. It's a little unfair. I mean, the world could be chaotic. It's not Joe Biden's fault that Putin invaded Ukraine and this horrible war that's going on. No, this is a way of saying... The Republican message is he's too old and feeble. Now, I mentioned the other day that they're more than willing to give him credit, Trump is, for masterminding a vast conspiracy involving the Justice Department and prosecutors across the country to persecute Trump. So he can mastermind this whole elaborate conspiracy, but he can't tie his own shoes. It's like, choose a horse and ride it, brother. Conspiracy theories do not have to be consistent. This is something we know from history, right? The Jews in charge of everything and they're weak. I mean, it's- Yes. Yeah. No, you're right."
fGcdGM0q8MR,4494,David Axelrod,"I don't know whether it's because he's confined. I posited on Hacks On Tap that he's jealous that Christ gets all this attention. I don't know. I don't know what it is. But his outbursts over the weekend just remind people that the guy is nuts, and living with him is like a... I saw some guy in a focus group say, he was a guy who voted for Trump before, but said he couldn't again, and he said, ""Trump as president is like having a neighbor who runs a jackhammer 24 hours a day,"" he says, ""Just exhausting."" And so, I think there's some element of that that will erode some of these gauzy memories. But I think the Biden campaign has to remind people, and you and I, we may have a difference of opinion on this particular piece of policy, but the one signature achievement of the Trump administration was a $1.7 trillion tax cut that primarily favored corporations and wealthy people. Right. It is the single most negative thing, up there with abortion rights, but it is more broadly impactful. And you talk about that, his inaction on pharmaceutical prices, a whole range of issues on which, on economics, he's just in the wrong place. And if there is a presumption that goes to Joe Biden for having some sense of the way real people, or average people, live..."
AU089ZkpkHL,4208,David Axelrod,"He's doing stuff. I mean, the Justice Department just went after some real estate interests for price fixing on rents. The FTC just issued a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain issues from the pandemic. It turns out that they're jacking it up way beyond what their costs increases were. They're fighting these fights, but not really highlighting them to the degree I would in a campaign like this. Bottom line, be more like Joe from Scranton and less like President Biden from Washington. Put yourself on the side- because those are the voters, Bill, who are going to decide this election; working class people, Black, white, and Hispanic, who are very much scuffling still in an economy that's improved, but in which cost of living has aggregated and continues to be an obstacle. It's just so hard when you're the incumbent president and incumbent president's team to get them not to defend their record. Let's put it this way, not to have them ... They want to spend 80% of their time defending their record and explaining why they're doing better than anyone realizes, and 20% of the time talking about what they still want to do in the second term and so forth. Of course, what you're saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this- I don't even.."
dEW1WEy_XlE,3888,David Axelrod,"I think that it's probably wise to make that decision closer to the event because who knows what condition Trump is going to be in going into that convention? If you need it, you should do it. If he does it, how he does it and how he appears to people will be obviously very important. If he needs a debate, he needs a good debate. He needs a debate in which his performance seems vigorous and engaged. It's almost as important as what he says. That's what Rove's point was in our discussion, but I'd make that decision later. His answer when he was asked this was, ""Well, it depends on how he behaves,"" which doesn't exactly sound like a prescription for debating because if you're going on the basis of Trump's behavior, he disqualifies himself every day. It does hold open the decision and my guess is they will hold that decision open until they have to make it. RFK Junior and other possible third, fourth, fifth parties? I mean serious problem, clear who he takes votes from or not? Can the campaigns arrange things, push things so that he takes votes more from the other candidate than from your own candidate? Yeah, I think first of all, general premise, Trump has always gotten around 46%, 47% of the vote."
BmNqk6_R7iY,3920,David Axelrod,"It's kind of stable, but very much on the margin."" Then, you look at all the things that are so unusual and so crazy, 77 year old and 81 year old, legal cases- Two incumbents. ...Dissatisfaction with both nominees, the world and a fair amount of chaos and could be much better, could be much worse. I sort of think, I don't know, it might be the opposite of stable and predictable. Anybody who makes forecasts- I feel like it's both things can't be true, that it's stable and predictable and totally unstable and unpredictable. I don't know. Forecasts are for fools right here. I mean I think you can maybe say who would win today. I think anybody who says they know who's going to win in November is foolish because there are too many imponderables. We mentioned the trials with Trump. Obviously, we're relying on the notion that Biden is going to be hale and hearty from now until November. A slip and fall or something like that could have an impact. There are a lot of variables here. The one thing I think you can predict is it's going to be close one way or the other. Beyond that, I would not venture. We'll get back together maybe after the conventions or maybe- I'm not sure a lot of what I said makes sense."
OqU6gXBrlYW,3934,David Axelrod,"They had a brilliant convention in 2020 that was all or mostly virtual because of the pandemic, but they really branded Biden as a guy from Scranton who had good middle class values and sensibilities and economic values, who was a man of faith, who was a part of a military family. That was helpful. They used Republicans for Biden effectively. It was a lot of our people in the Republicans votes against Trump. Exactly, it was probably as well conceived a convention as I've seen and I've been a part of some that I was proud of. They did a great job and hopefully they can do that again and not have the thing overwhelmed by protesters. Is that an important moment you think, July, August, or are these days the conventions just come and go? I mean do you think that's sort of a possible inflection point? It used to be '88 Bush rallies at the convention, overtakes Dukakis. It doesn't seem like it happens quite that way anymore, but do you still think there's a- No, they're TV shows now and they're not watched as much as they used to be, but there's still an opportunity for branding and to tell a story. I talked at the beginning about the fact that campaigns are about narratives. You should leave a convention knowing what that narrative is."
z2pLzMXR9pf,4203,David Axelrod,"Well, even, I recoil from, after this last weekend, everybody's hair was on fire because he, except Jon Stewart, he had a great bit on this last night, because some guy had on his bumper somehttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Biden. ...phonied-up artwork of Biden bound in the back of his truck. And there is so much out there, so many people out there saying, ""Don't give Trump a platform, don't let Trump..."" I have the opposite view, which is I think more of Trump is better out there, because I do think people need to be exposed to... He's crazier now than he was in 2016, and even 2020, although it's hard to compete with telling people to drink or inject bleach to fight... But he's kind of scary crazy, and people need to understand the choice. I can't stand this notion that if we censor him, it'll all be okay. That's not the case. And I think he's profited, actually... I was relieved when he got taken off Twitter, because it was a migraine headache every day and it was provocative. But now, he's micro channeling, to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just... All that said, Bill, that's just an aside, I'm just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don't think, at the end of the day, that the campaign should be based on all of that."
Ahxe5iqmBhu,3834,David Axelrod,"Exactly. I don't know, I was actually not that upset about the Bible and all that Lee Greenwood stuff, but I was talking with someone about it, and he doesn't follow politics that much, but he's smart, he said, ""Look, that's just Trump. Of course, everyone knows he's a huckster and a grifter. You can scream and yell about that, but there's not one voter who doesn't know that, including Trump voters, they know that's what he does. But at the end of the day, what's he doing? People are voluntarily spending $60, maybe foolishly, on a King James Bible."" Cheaper than the gym shoes. Yeah, with American documents attached. But that's not an effective argument against him. At the end of the day, oh, fine, he's marketing Bibles. Other people sell... There's a way in which we all... We, but a certain type of... A lot of people in the media, I'd say, really want to go after him on the cultural signifiershttps://gettrumpsneakers.com Yeah. ...and not so much on, as you say, the bread and butter issues.

This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these... These are strategies. This isn't just expressions of outrage on his part, they're strategies, and we need to call them out for what they are. Well, yeah, I've very much thought that, therefore, I don't really like the, ""He's popping off again, it's all instinct with him and anger."" And there's, of course, a lot of that, God knows, but yeah, there are these branding strategies, he's been doing that for 50 years, marketing- Yes. ...and he's unfortunately good at it. I said to someone the other day, I was critical of the Biden campaign, but I was sympathetic, I said, ""It's tough to run against Trump, he's a tough opponent. He's, in his own crazy way, a very skilled politician of a certain type."" And the person looked at me like I was just crazy. ""Trump is not skilled at anything. Trump is a lunatic. Trump is crazy. He can't control himself. He says one stupid thing after another."" But I think that's a mistake among Liberals and Democrats."
18bfK5uJOHZ,4302,Doug Sosnik,"I think it's true for Republicans, I know it's true for Democrats, which the last time that the convention served that purpose of nominating someone based on who's on the convention floor was '68. Yeah, that's an unfortunate memory for Democrats. Yeah, and so that was such a disastrous- But let me make this, can I just- So I read this little piece, and I said, it's funny that the convention was in Chicago, because you know what? The convention was in Chicago, Roosevelt in 1932, and I believe Roosevelt was nominated on the third ballot, and it was a very much of a weeding out of candidates, some of whom... They weren't really primaries then, but who were favorite sons and so forth. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago at 1860 on the fourth ballot, so maybe multi-ballot conventions in Chicago were good. Then [inaudible] 19,000 people wrote in and said, ""Are you kidding? What about '68?"" But I would make this point about '68, just not to obsess too much on the replacing Biden thing. It was a horrible mass. Robert Kennedy was tragically assassinated, McCarthy, Humphrey, the violence in Chicago, Dick Daley, the whole nightmare, right? Still, at the end of the day, Humphrey almost won in '68, and I believe Humphrey would've ran better in '68 than Lyndon Johnson would have..."
TVp4Oa-L5H6,3997,Doug Sosnik,"And so for completely different reasons. I think they're obviously in a much stronger position within their own parties now than they were back in June. What's different, and it is different, is the race, I would say from the beginning of last year until around the middle to end of October, was pretty static. And it had Biden ahead of Trump, both nationally and in the battleground states. It was consistent. It wasn't an overwhelming lead, but it was a lead of 2, 3, 4 points pretty much consistently. The polls never changed. Over the last three and a half, four months, the race has changed. And it started, I would say around the end of October with a series of polls that came out. There was a six-state battleground New York Times poll, which had Trump ahead in all six battleground states. And pretty significantly, the NBC poll that came out in early November had Trump ahead for the first time in their polling. And their Wall Street Journal poll came out in November, which not only showed the same Trump advantage, but they asked a series of questions which haven't changed in the last three and a half months, which compared voters' views of what life was like when Trump was president compared to what life is like with Biden as president."
Q16H7nCygAb,4108,Doug Sosnik,"What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring of '95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching him. And that really struck me, that struck fear with me. And I do worry a little bit that at some point the public is going to shut down on Biden in terms of giving him another look. And he's got two related but different challenges right now. One is to inspire and motivate his base to not only support them, but to turn out. And it's far from a given that that's going to happen. And then the other of course is with the swing voters in the handful of states that'll determine the next president if it's a close election, his numbers with the swing voters are lagging his overall numbers, which are quite bad. The kicker view in your New York Times piece was that disqualifying Trump might not be enough or likely wouldn't be enough. You can't just do that. I think Democrats have really been counting on that to a considerable degree. Explain that a bit. I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don't think have either thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary Clinton's campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message."
JF2sIHI8Ek0,3986,Doug Sosnik,"Secondly, Obama, who got elected, is essentially challenging the Democratic establishment. When he got elected president, he didn't care about the Democratic party. He didn't care about democratic candidates. He never took all his data file of millions of supporters and went to the DNC. The Democrats made historic losses in 2010 due to the negligence, and over the course of eight years of Obama, Democrats lost almost 1,000 state legislative candidates, got eviscerated in the house and the Senate, controls of these legislatures, and so really the 2010s was a lost generation, a lost decade for Democratic elected officials across the country, and as I said earlier, fed this lost generation. Now, since, I would say, lastly, since 2016, so we're clocking in now eight years, the organizing principle of the Democratic Party has not been what you're for, but what you're against, and it's been a party that's been organized singularly to deal and beat with Donald Trump. And so, you've got this sort of mishmash of forces that have been building, that are going to explode the day after the election, about what does it mean to be a Democrat? I mean my slight-maybe caveat, I don't know what you think of this-of that count, which is very, very interesting. I mean particularly I want to say how important it is what you say about the sort of Clintons and then Obama/Biden dominating for so long, that they did probably suppress a whole generation of people who we know even who've left office by now, they rose and fell."
XR1vw5wwKRs,3976,Doug Sosnik,"And people feel the impact every day when they're walking around and see these people sleeping on the streets and the safety. But it's also a proxy for what I mentioned earlier about just the sense that things are not in control here now and that there's not really a strong government in place to bring our lives back to normal. I'm struck how much the retrospective, maybe slightly inaccurate, but whatever, view of things were much better when Trump or somewhat better when Trump was there. It helps him so much, right? I mean, if someone like me, here's what he says about NATO, and I think, A, that's incredibly irresponsible and dangerous and B, it actually suggests what a second Trump term would be like and it would be much more dangerous than a first Trump term. But I have the impression, voters they hear this stuff, it's all kind of noise. Trump's just being Trump. He says these things, but the thing they have to compare that's fairly concrete is the Trump first term, or I suppose more accurately the memory of the Trump first term and the perception of the current Biden term. And I feel like that gives Trump a cushion that a normal challenger who said these kinds of things doesn't have. I mean, he's weirdly advantaged by being both the challenger, the outsider, the change candidate, and hey, he was president."
PWyQcACm72w,3953,Doug Sosnik,"I mean, the degree to which it is based around one person, Trump, but then by now it's got a pretty big associated bunch of not just issues but attitudes, and stances towards institutions and towards the past, and repudiation of the recent past of that party in a really dramatic way, right? I mean, the Trump people hate the Bush and McCain and [inaudible] people more than they hate Democrats, to some degree. I don't know. It's to say a little bit about these two parties, right? Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I don't quite know how that all works out, but... You're absolutely right, and they are completely in different places. And if you take Yogi Berra's old saying, ""If there's a fork in the road, take it."" The Republicans have taken their fork in the road, and they're now more of a working class party, more of a nationalist party, more of a MAGA party. They are. And so in a sense they're, it's kind of a narrow base of support, but quite deep. I think on the Democratic side, back to the Yogi Berra quote, they haven't taken the fork in the road, and, in fact, this is something I've written on and I haven't published it yet, there's going to be an enormous reckoning for the Democratic Party that's going to happen the day after the election, regardless of whether Trump is elected or not."
df6sTjYOE1C,4219,Doug Sosnik,"They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report. And that was not great. And then he chose not to do the Super Bowl interview. And again, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, obviously in the big picture, no one's going to remember Super Bowl interview in 2024, but I don't know if that's sustainable for eight, nine months. Trump isn't exactly Mr. Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get... He's good at giving the impression that he's doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at least, and therefore people kind of feel like he's on top of things. Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press compared to Biden. So let me just say this quickly on the interview. These interviews have become staples of Super Bowl Sunday. They have changed over time and have become less soft interviews and harder interviews and more aggressive interviews. So that's changed. They had over 10 million people watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that's a lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people didn't want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the interview."
eaIME5GfFz4,3925,Doug Sosnik,"I think on the Democratic side, back to the Yogi Berra quote, they haven't taken the fork in the road, and, in fact, this is something I've written on and I haven't published it yet, there's going to be an enormous reckoning for the Democratic Party that's going to happen the day after the election, regardless of whether Trump is elected or not. And you've got a combination of forces that are really going to explode the day after the election. What is the nature, as you said earlier about the nature of the Democratic Party, which is really, I call it almost a federation of interest, whether you're motivated by gun control, or pro-choice, or Black lives matter, or unions, or the environment. But what you've got is a party that's got really stunted growth. And the reason it's been stunted is, the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, and the Obama-Biden administration have now controlled and dominated American politics for over 30 years. So there's an entire generation of Democratic elected officials had never had an opportunity to rise. Secondly, Obama, who got elected, is essentially challenging the Democratic establishment. When he got elected president, he didn't care about the Democratic party. He didn't care about democratic candidates. He never took all his data file of millions of supporters and went to the DNC."
dbHRldopemS,4102,Doug Sosnik,"Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it. He's not going to be exciting. He doesn't need to be exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something happened for a moment, the big point about '68, though, and what happened after was, they changed the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he'd broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would've won. But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC."
c0mjHW2_Gsw,3915,Doug Sosnik,"The one thing, Super Bowl did have the highest ratings ever, and that was predictable that it was going to have very high ratings. And people are happy when they're watching the Super Bowl generally, I think, and maybe they're worried about their own team if they're in San Francisco or Kansas City, but otherwise it's a spectacle, you get together. And that's always been such a gimme for the incumbent president to have a pleasant interview with two sports announcers, in this case on CBS, who presumably are going to ask totally nice questions to Biden and let him talk a little bit about how much he likes sports and reminiscing about playing football with his kids, whatever he wants, who he's rooting for, did he grow up rooting for the Eagles? I mean, whatever. And the fact that they didn't do that, I feel is now maybe he just didn't want to do it and he's busy. I mean, there are a million things, right? But maybe I'm wrong that it's always such an easy interview, but I feel like, geez, can you really go through- have a strategy for nine months where you're not... They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report."
yKvz6fcmKEL,9283,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary? I guess not. It just makes me so sick. I wrote that for The Bulwark months ago. They're not allowed to say that he didn't win the election. Chris Sununu says that, Chris Christie says that. Mike Pence says things like, ""I didn't do what he wanted me to do because I didn't have the constitutional authority to on January 6th,"" and will always disagree, but he doesn't like to come out and say, ""We lost the election."" He really avoids that. But you shouldn't incite mobs. It's the story of the Capitol. But they won't even, they will not even criticize January 6th. So not only will they not say he lost, they will not say he definitely tried to steal an election, he plotted a two-month coup, he incited a deadly a riot where people died. They won't touch January 6th. They won't touch his coup plotting. And so the message they're sending everybody is that it's okay. And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day."
zww8HBVK_3q,8276,A.B. Stoddard,"So, first of all, I totally agree with you about early stumbles can really help the maturation of a presidential campaign and candidate. And the reset can turn the whole ship around. I think in the case of Ron DeSantis, because he just basically also doesn't seem to have much personality, if you combine the fact that he has the too-tight-shoe look on his face and doesn't really love hanging around with people, which John McCain ultimately did. I mean, once you got him into the diner or into the town hall, even if he was grumpy on the way out to the car, he really liked talking with people. So if you combine that with the fact that he hasn't figured out his way to defeat Trump. When you run, this is the most surreal presidential primary where you have everyone saying, ""Oh, he is the best president we've ever had. But I don't know, I guess I'm in this primary in case he has a heart attack or gets indicted."" I mean, the indictments, first of all, I don't think he'll be prosecuted before election day. And I don't think there's a jury that would convict him in this country. Because I think there always will be an outlier among the jurors. And then I just think Ron DeSantis, we've seen him in a jam after the Stormy Daniels...."
MFdb8iFJjEW,8293,A.B. Stoddard,"So look, as this gets more difficult in the next few weeks, it's not... And then of course, even if we move beyond this, he's going to try to force them to shut the government down again on the government funding fight for September. He wants the confrontation, and he wants to be their leader, and dominate, and push them around. So I'm going to be surprised if he stays out of it. I mean, I think he's going to be, when it gets really tense and there's like some real stuff on the table, if it looks like McCarthy's about to convince his members to support it and it can pass Schumer's Senate, I'm sure Trump's just going to get in there and editorialize. He could be an exacerbating factor, and he could make it very hard for McCarthy. Hard to see why he wouldn't. But I guess stranger things have happened. I mean he's a huge wild card, as you say. I mean, in a way, the best case for Trump is if he gets to scream and yell about how it's a sellout, and then quietly let it go through, not actually put too much pressure on members. Because Trump does not actually want, presumably... In a certain way he wants, I don't know, does he want a crisis?"
oCaSyJmUexq,8257,A.B. Stoddard,"To get away with as much as he can. It's to get away with things. And he's gotten away with January 6th, and the plotting of a coup. He's gotten away with being found potentially... first, he stole documents, classified documents from the White House, but potentially he obstructed justice and caused his lawyers to lie and everything. The more this builds, the more intense the support. And the establishment and the elites, who are not in the 2024 field but are connected to the donors in this deep sense of fear about Donald Trump being their nominee, are still powerless in the face of his strength. Okay, well, there's a lot there. So let's unpack that a little. I mean, A, do you take it that DeSantis is close to being the only alternative to Trump? That, I mean, it's sort of 90% that it's one of the two of them, 95%... I mean, you think it is? Do you think no one's going to come from 4% and have a dramatic run and upset both of the people ahead of them, ahead of that person? This is an amazing thing that you look at the same polls I do that Pence and Haley are always number three and four, which is stunning to me. I understand the appeal of Nikki Haley."
xRKsGM3dJry,8327,A.B. Stoddard,"But what struck me about the CNN Town Hall was that his lies, they were coming so fast and he wasn't the least bit sheepish about them. And it's a tool for dominance. We've watched him now, it's my eighth year of watching this up close, and it definitely has changed. He lies more and more loudly and more rapidly in a setting like that. And he is the president, and he creates his own reality. And if you want to try to drop in there and correct him, you're just like a gnat on the windshield. You're just going to get run over and 'see ya.' So it was both a great night for him and it was truly terrifying, I thought. Yeah, I mean, that's so well said. Because when you read up on authoritarians in the past and on con men, two categories that Trump probably fits in pretty well, they get better at it. I mean, I thought in 2015 I think Trump said these outrageous things and these lies, and you could tell he was a little uncertain like, ""Can I get away with this exactly?"" And I don't know if you could tell, maybe I'm reading stuff in retrospectively, but he seemed a little more tentative, let's say. And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all..."
pDi5-dtw3Xw,8402,A.B. Stoddard,"And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day. So he's been rewarded by the primary electorate and the fact that his rivals cannot bring themselves to criticize any of that. Do you think DeSantis... Two questions. He launches in 10 days or so, does he start criticizing Trump more directly either because he can't win or because he wouldn't actually be as good a president as he DeSantis would be? And also it seems like DeSantis's strategy is focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, if you win both of those, you're probably the nominee, if you win one of them, you have shot at being the nominee, and that's how an underdog typically gets to at least parody with a front-runner, you win Iowa, Obama won Iowa and so forth, McCain won New Hampshire in 2000. McCain fell short, Obama won the nomination, but in each case that's how they became the plausible alternative to the person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W."
KlfJKiTwTxo,9016,A.B. Stoddard,"All they'd have to do is say you have to pledge to support the nominee and they won't hold Trump to [inaudible] but of course they would hold Liz to it. But they're not going to hold Trump to it. Right, of course not. He's not going to pledge to support any nominee except for him. Will he debate, do you think? What do you think? I don't think he will. Interesting. Because it's just a set-up for failure. He could go in and start screaming at everybody and saying crazy things and dominate, and he likes that, I think he enjoys the actual fight, but I think he knows, he's telling people privately, I'm too far ahead, he knows that the most likely outcome is he loses his lead a little bit and so what's the point? And they can all stand the stage and say he's afraid and he'll be like, ""They're afraid."" Yeah, it draws him down to their level if you're the front-runner in your debate, whereas he's done a town hall, he's not scared of anything. This is where that CNN Town Hall let's just do a final before we get to President Biden, who's important. This is, of course, typical of the Biden years, you spend the first half hour of the conversation on Trump, Right."
uNLAn4uiNQL,8705,A.B. Stoddard,"And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you're a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new liberal friends are, ""well, he can't get away with this. This lie is even worse,"" but I think they underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it... The open mic night is a great line of Mike's, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn't that bad last time. Then you say, ""Well, the reason he wasn't that bad if he wasn't was because he had 19 different constraints, both individuals and institutional constraints that won't exist in a second term,"" but no one of course is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn't stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think? I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary?"
X350NDLtLpx,8824,A.B. Stoddard,"So that's what I was expecting. I was expecting a big Republican margin that was going to buffer them, and let the crazies rule. So it's a challenge for the Democrats to respond to that, and they need to get their head around the fact that McCarthy has landed in a good spot right now. At least tactically. No, that's such an important point. And we'll close with that. I do feel like the Democrats haven't done a very good job of taking all these mini-scandals and embarrassments, George Santos and stuff, they haven't really wrapped it around the Republican's neck. So it's sort of well, Santos is a bizarre story, and here's the latest detail of that. But no one thinks, I don't know, that somehow, shouldn't the speaker do something about that? Or shouldn't his colleagues do something? And that's been true of Gosar and others. And so the Democrats are not very good at sort of attaching the worst things any one Republican member does to the whole conference. And McCarthy has done a decent job of getting Marjorie Taylor Green and Gaetz and all to speak up less. I guess maybe the speaker vote thing, which was sort of an short-term embarrassment to McCarthy was kind of also a wake-up call for all the others that we can't go through, it would hurt them all if everything just broke."
Bl0xKfVwVRi,8265,A.B. Stoddard,"Oh, sorry, South Dakota, about the E. Jean Carroll verdict. And if you have, that was a civil defamation case, on a serious indictment or maybe for obstruction of justice, if you have people say, ""We just can't nominate someone like this, that's doing the work for Ron DeSantis."" So a few things have to align in order for him to avoid criticizing Trump. He will be asked by every reporter wherever he goes, maybe sometimes voters, but in the end is he going to have to criticize Trump on the debate stage because we don't think that Trump's going to show up? So it's very hard now for me to see how this plays out without just damage happening to Trump because of Trump. Maybe this accusation that Rudy Giuliani was trying to sell pardons at two million a pop and maybe Trump was involved in, we don't know, things could happen that weigh Trump down that would help Ron DeSantis, but I think he has to screw up the courage to say, ""I am running because we need a better nominee. I am better for these reasons."" And I think he has to find a way to say that with strength. Yeah, I think that's right. For all that the Republican establishment is discredited allegedly and mixed blessing, I do think having a lot of these senators and governors just weigh in the way you just said would have some effect on those swing maybe Trump voters."
oRfjKfkDmaY,6888,Tom Tugendhat,"I feel like this could be a pretty big moment 2022. Or is that fanciful? No, I think you're right. No, I think you're right. I think it is a big moment. Look, I mean think whatever element of support you think that we, you, anyone else should be giving to Ukraine, it's perfectly obvious that you can't ignore Putin anymore. You can't ignore Russia. You can't pretend that autocracies aren't really threatening violence against liberal democracies. You can't pretend that China's threats against Taiwan are just performative anymore. They look preparatory in the light of Ukraine. You can't... Do you know what I mean? There's a whole number of issues that even six to 12 months ago, you could have said, ""Well, a major state on state conflict is so unlikely. A real invasion? Sure. They may try to undermine, they may try to corrupt, they may try to infiltrate, but they wouldn't invade would they?"" And a lot of people were saying that on the 23rd of February. In fact, some Ukrainians I was talking to were saying that on the 23rd of February. I don't think anybody's saying that now about any country. The reality is that state on state warfare, I'm afraid, sadly is a reality again, and I think that's a big change because I think it's a huge wake up moment for even those who thought that we should be doing deals with dictators in various different ways are now realizing that actually, that may be harder than they thought."
ylGe_xOe_JB,7204,Tom Tugendhat,"And so I'm very sorry it has required the invasion, of the attack on Kyiv to do it, but I'm very glad that we've finally woken up. So I think that this is a huge change. Well, let's talk about that for a minute and get back to Ukraine itself and the situation on the ground, but that's important. I mean, how much of a mugging by reality has there been? Or are people understanding, though, coming grips with it? My father used the phrase, ""Neoconservatives and liberals who are mugged by reality."" And a friend of his said, ""Well, there's an awful lot of liberals around who,"" this was 30, 40 years ago, ""who sort of understand that they've been mugged by reality, but don't want to press charges."" Which I thought was a nice way of capturing a certain kind of, ""Well, yeah, Putin's worst than we thought. Who thought he would do this? I predicted he wouldn't, ugh. But on the other hand, we can't really go crazy and we have to work with him and energy and other things. And it's a big country, and China's more of a threat."" And so where do you think we are on the sort of Putin question generally, as you would see in terms of what you would take to be a sound understanding of it, of him and of it?"
uoQx1uW8JCI,6805,Tom Tugendhat,"So this was a pretty universal view. In fact, so much so that you may remember President Biden offered a helicopter to go and get President Zelensky out. And he very famously responded, ""I don't need a lift, I need ammunition."" And thank God he did because his courage solidified the defense of Kyiv. And in solidifying the defense of Kyiv, he solidified the defense of the whole country. And he's been quite literally, personally, quite literally on the front line of freedom ever since. And so it's been quite remarkable. So I don't think it was a foregone conclusion at all. There are various reasons I'm sure would come to them as to why the Russians failed, partly their own fault, partly the courage to the Ukrainians and partly, thank God, people like Ben Wallace who's our defense secretary who got weapons into Ukraine when a lot of people were either saying, ""There's no point they'll be defeated so quickly they won't count."" Or, ""It can all wait, don't get involved."" And that's just people in our own system, let alone in other countries. And so it's been really quite something. And I think being with them this year, being in Ukraine this year, being in Kyiv this year was really quite moving as well, because of course it's been a long time since your independence day was marked by anything other than fireworks and celebrations."
BhbFHyk12zK,6542,Tom Tugendhat,"If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty. I think we underestimate that at our peril. No, I think that's very well said, and I mean, the courage plus competence apparently, in leadership. Yeah, totally. And a high level of competence. That's awfully important to people. Like I mean, it happens, and then of course, when things swell, of course, that's how it was going to go, but it didn't have to go that way. No, and you're... Maybe we'll close on this. You were such a critic of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. I mean, think of what the world looks like if Ukraine falls. You know, Zelensky just doesn't make the right decisions, or the Russians make better decisions, and they take the airport near Kyiv, and then it goes, and the whole thing [inaudible] - Or we make the wrong decisions and we don't support it. Very much so, so I mean, what does a world in which we've pulled out of Afghanistan and watched the Taliban take that back over, and then six months later, Ukraine goes under, or part of it, a large part of it, let's say, to a brutal invasion from Putin."
TjKnKaTpyIn,6987,Tom Tugendhat,"But are you a little heartened? Are you worried, concerned? What heartens you? What concerns you, et cetera? Well, I mean on one level I'm heartened, there's been huge numbers of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves have expanded from, well, depending on how you count, some two, 300,000 people at arms to what's now, I mean, depending on who you ask, anywhere between 700,000 and a few million in various different ways. I mean, these numbers, for very obvious reasons of national security, the Ukrainians aren't advertising the figures, and of course it depends whether you count things like border forces and reserve battalions and how you count them and so on. But basically the Ukrainians have mobilized their entire nation very effectively. The weapon supplies are coming through from many allies, not all. There's a few notable exceptions that are pretty famous. And the Ukrainians are in a better position than they were when we spoke, whenever it was, eight, 10 weeks ago. The reality is they've just launched their counter offensive in Kherson, an area in the Southeast of the country. I tell you my thoughts and prayers are with their soldiers. I hope very much that they achieve the ends that they need. But the reality is this is a hard slog, and..."
3eHfL3O6HnW,7498,Tom Tugendhat,"We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know? But he still did it. He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it. I think we underestimate the importance of President Zelensky's courage to the shape of the world as it will be in 10 years time. If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty."
PBRBU_shVvQ,6772,Tom Tugendhat,"I tell you my thoughts and prayers are with their soldiers. I hope very much that they achieve the ends that they need. But the reality is this is a hard slog, and... Although I think there's no great doubt the Russians have lost. And what we're now seeing is the pain of defeat for the Russian Armed Forces inside Ukraine. Sadly, that pain is shared and too many Ukrainians are being killed in the process as well. I have no doubt that the end result is clear. The courage and commitment of the Ukrainian people means that Ukraine will not and cannot be a Russian satellite or a Russian colony again. And now what we need to do is to make sure that the trauma of occupation is ended as soon as possible. And this counter offensive, it seems kind of impressive, both in its conception and, well, certainly it's a couple of days in, its execution, but it's unlikely you think it will result in a route of the Russians where somehow the situation is solved in six weeks. I mean, I'm not close enough to the frontline and close enough to the military elements to comment on it, I'm afraid. And you'll forgive me as a former professional soldier, I know how easy it is to get false impressions from TV reports or from reported gossip."
iPDq2iIhJ_6,6587,Tom Tugendhat,"Well, yeah. And I went to Ukraine for their Independence Day, actually. And one of the reasons I went is because some people, I think you are one of those nations, seem to value your independence day very highly. You got your independence off some very, very fine people, but the Ukrainians got their independence off a totalitarian dictatorship and have quite rightly valued it very highly. This was their 31st anniversary, and it's an anniversary that's marked with quite a lot of darkness as well, of course, because it's the six month anniversary of the latest round of invasions. I say the latest because of course Russia has been intervening in Ukraine ever since their independence 31 years ago. And of course, most famously in 2014 actually invaded Crimea and the Donbas, and so has been there. But most famously, this year, on the 24th of February, so six months before the Independence Day, Russian troops tried to encircle and capture Kyiv, and thank God, failed, not just down to their own incompetence, although that was an important element, but down to the extraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people and some fantastic leadership by President Volodymyr Zelensky. So it was a hell of a thing to be there for their independence day this year, as you can imagine. And it was very moving to be with some very, very brave people."
uH_VvUgNOdA,7478,Tom Tugendhat,"It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia. And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people."
FBfF8uxTWE1,6998,Tom Tugendhat,"And he's managed to get German foreign policy changed pretty radically in recent months. His Zeitenwende , his sort of time of change as it were that he spoke about in February means that he's pledged 100 billion euro to German defense spending, which is, it's not nothing. That's a hell of an increase. And he's speaking about different ways of helping the Ukrainian people as well, so that's not nothing. Although, I did read recently that a Polish minister was referring to the end of Ostpolotik politic and the beginning of ""lost politik."" And there is a tension now between some of those countries that border Russia or near border Russia, like Poland. I would say it borders Belarus rather than Russia. But those bordering states, near bordering states, and those that are further away, and there's a certain resentment between them and the level of commitment that some are showing and others could. And they'll have to show commitment at home, right? It'll be cold in the winter and energy prices will go up a lot and they may be, I don't know, rationing and so forth with gas and they let themselves get dependent on Russia. Unfortunately, we didn't do much to help them the other way, I will say, to be fair to them. Everyone beats up Germany, but it wasn't as if we were saying..."
PGWcFzI7knp,7031,Jack Goldsmith,"Yes. So, I spend a lot of time trying not to be alarmed. So my general disposition is to not be alarmed and to wait until we have concrete evidence that we need to be alarmed. Because so many things in his first term that he pledged to do never came about. I suspect that's going to happen here as well. You already see, and I don't want to be naive, you already see some moderation in what they claim to want to be doing. So just with that background, for me, one of the most worrisome things is, and there's a contradiction in what the Trump people are saying, is whether they are going to fight the lawfare they perceived with lawfare of their own from the Justice Department. My own view is that the Trump people have credible reasons to be upset about some of the things that the Department and the Bureau did to them over many years. I wouldn't agree with all of their complaints, but you just need to read five or six Inspector General reports to see that the Bureau and the Department didn't always cover itself in glory. And there was another one that just came out yesterday from the Inspector General of the Justice Department, and we can talk, if you want, about which of the prosecutions and investigations were legitimate or not."
L6BvZlmf7v_,7561,Jack Goldsmith,"They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump. And let me just say, part of what Trump is about is to just blow up all these norms. He thinks or talks or acts as if he thinks that they're just illegitimate, that they're corrupt, that the Justice Department is under the control of the deep state or the Democrats or some combination of both. And there were some deep state shenanigans against him in his first term, and I get it, but this is all completely out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, it's started to become ordinary. There's so many things, nobody, just to change topics for a second, nobody in this election talked about tax disclosure, very few people. That was a big deal in 2016, 2020. Trump defied it twice, and now, nobody cares. And it had been in practice for, what, 40 years or something like that? Going back to Watergate, going back either to Ford or Carter, I can't remember. And same with conflict of interest rules, very little discussion of that. Now, it's just accepted, now, that they're not going to follow the statutory rules, almost very few of them, and none of the important ones apply to the president."
ZfTA0DdsBqA,7583,Jack Goldsmith,"And a very high percentage of pardons, when you think about it, including Clinton's example, which are pretty deplorable, the huge majority of them are cleaning the record as a favor of someone. Maybe you shouldn't do it. It's not quite equitable. But the two previous family pardons, Bill Clinton's brother, I think had served a year in jail in the '80s. Clinton pardoned him in 2000 to kind of clear the record, so to speak, and the same was true... There's another one, which I'm blanking on, but where it's a very similar situation. Yeah, I can't remember, but there's one other. It's a previous... It's an old, so to speak. Yes. This was the middle of a court case. He'd gone to trial, he'd chosen to go. It was kind of messed up the way the plea deal fell apart, but he'd chosen, in any case, to go to trial. There was a jury. It wasn't like this was some arbitrary star chamber thing. I don't think people thought the trial was particularly unfairly conducted or anything. He was, of course, ready to appeal. He had plenty of attorneys to do that. I feel like doing it in the middle like that is more egregious in a way than doing a favor for someone that you respect or to be fair to someone you think was a good civil servant, a good public servant who deserves to, in a sense, have a break retrospectively."
wnNae1-HSjL,7046,Jack Goldsmith,"So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years. So it's going to be very hard to say, okay, we now know what's going to happen because he could... And who knows which one of his new subordinates he's going to have fallings out with. He's already fired his White House council before and gotten a second one. He's lost one nominee. I mean, this idea that this is going to be a disciplined organization compared to the first one I think is yet to be proven. And I suppose just on the first three or four months, we'll also see these second and third tier appointments, which the overall character of which you mentioned OLC in particular, but will be pretty important. Does the FBI suddenly have 20 non-career people there working for Patel, or is it basically one director and some career- I'm pretty sure that... Maybe is an inspector general in the FBI or is it in the DOJ? But I'm pretty sure that the FBI director is the only political appointment in the bureau. Up until now, but this will be- Well, we'll see if they can use the civil service rules and the two- I'm going to say that's one instance of just..."
Fd0v6KMRyJH,7459,Jack Goldsmith,"It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime. It may be that previous Justice Departments have overreached in indicting people for things or investigating people for things, but there's at least been the claim that there's an actual statute somewhere in the, what's it called, the code of whatever it's called, the legal code. UC Code, yeah. Yeah. There's like Statue 1274, which someone violated. Well, we don't usually... Let me just back. Yes, first of all, I wasn't surprised, because he did that all throughout his first term. He did it all throughout the campaign. So the thing that surprised me last Sunday was the moderating part, not the part about people needing to go to jail. Yeah, we don't typically have presidents talking about who should go to jail. Biden actually did once in violating norms during his term and said some other things he shouldn't have said. But typically, presidents don't even talk about this stuff. And typically, law enforcement doesn't talk about people going to jail. They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump."
3Qelhoypo5i,6963,Jack Goldsmith,"They're going to be pinned down on their views, and it'll be interesting to see if... I actually expect this to happen. I expect Pam Bondi to say, as Trump just said, that she's going to be independent and that of course, the president has the constitutional authority to order her to do whatever he wants, as he reminded us, and he does. But she is going to be independent. They're going to have the White House context policy, which actually doesn't impact the president so it's a no-brainer for them. It's in her interest to say that. I hope she realizes that and I hope she does that. Even Patel, in talking with the Senators, he hasn't been emphasizing killing FISA. He's been emphasizing ending the fentanyl crisis, stopping crime, et cetera. That's smart. So we'll learn a lot in the confirmation hearings. We'll learn a lot in the first three months of governance. And I think in three or four months, we'll have a sense of how much the lawfare is going to get going, whether there can be special counsel appointed. So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years."
dJZRNTNV57o,6984,Jack Goldsmith,"But it's an interesting question whether it will even work. It's not easy to reform these organizations. The contrast with Rumsfeld's important. I mean, he knew what he was doing. He knew where the dead bodies were. He knew what the channels of communication were. He knew how to reach down and do things. And there's always this problem that populist governments that put in non- experts to lead agencies fail because they don't know how to manipulate the bureaucracy. They don't know how to reform it. We'll see. I mean, we'll see. Again, depending on how, if Patel is confirmed, how he goes about it, depending on how Gabbard, if she's confirmed, how she goes about it, there are definitely right and wrong ways to go about reform and if there are wrecking balls that didn't work, it's never worked out before, frankly, and it didn't work for Stansfield Turner. He tried it, took that approach and he ended up doing the opposite by the end of his term as CIA director under Carter and other intelligence community leaders have had this. I'm not saying that reform is not a good idea and that certainly looking at reform isn't. And it's just a question of how they go about it and whether they're going to... This is another important point, so much of effective government is not just about the exercise of hard executive power to coerce people into doing things."
0Pta5n7hPLU,6930,Jack Goldsmith,"The Federal Advisory Committee Act is designed to govern just this situation. It has rules about, again, depending on the role that Musk plays, it has rules about transparency, conflict of interest, organization. I'm confident they're going to try to structure this in a way that circumvents this statute. There's an old Scalia opinion in the OLC that says the statute's unconstitutional. Not clear who can sue, but there have been lawsuits before. But I predict that's going to be... I'm sure the Trump people are working hard to exploit the loopholes. And there are some loopholes, but there's law governing that and there will be constraints on how they do that. And on the other hand, you're right, there are ways that the president surely can ensure that Musk gets the information he wants and can come to the conclusions that he wants. And Musk won't have any authority to implement anything, but the president can or the president can try to. I wouldn't underestimate how hard it's going to be. There are lots of rules about changing the administrative state, and maybe if I could do... This is actually an important distinction. No, this is important, so please spend some time on this, yeah. So this is an important distinction that doesn't get talked about enough. So most people think about reforming the administrative state in the kind of Reagan sense of pulling back the regulations, deregulating through changing the nature of the regulations."
mFbpSLftyGm,7037,Jack Goldsmith,"I mean, Hunter Biden wasn't going to affect anyone else's life. Well, I mean, I don't follow these things. There's a claim that Hunter could potentially implicate his father. Well, fair enough. That's true. I don't follow these things, and in fact, though the pardon makes that... Because now I think he loses some of his immunity to testify. But anyway, I haven't studied those claims. I agree. Trump was incomparable in his abuse. Many dozens... And I think Hunter's actually listed all of these and studied them all. I have a chart on this, and I think something like, I can't remember the number, but the person I did it with, we concluded that about 70% of the pardons were for friends or friends of friends. Several of them, as you say, were for people who had been indicted and prosecuted by Mueller and who may have testified against Trump. So he was incomparable in his abuse. I mean, remember, Bill Clinton was investigated after his Marc Rich pardon by the Southern District of New York. Jim Comey actually investigated him, so there was some possible wrongdoing there, but nothing compares to what Trump did in number or abuse. Nothing compares to it. Well, let's look forward, since he's about to become president again in six weeks, and talk generally maybe."
hWDz5fM7NRP,7208,Jack Goldsmith,"So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter. And so, again, one can be optimistic or pessimistic about what they're going to do. And I suppose whether it's one as optimistic or pessimistic is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah, Trump was amazing on just this past Sunday to ""Meet the Press."" He had, I'd say, half the time, was being pretty careful to, ""I'm not going to order anyone to do anything. It's their call."" On other issues too, mass deportations, while the Dreamers. ""Well, we try to work that out with Democrats."" And then, the other half of the time, it was, ""Well, Liz Cheney deserves to be in jail."" Right. And that, I found a little astonishing from the president elect to say about a member or former members of Congress, all the members of that committee deserve to go to prison. And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime."
hJCIZ4QLqPF,17477,Anne Applebaum,"The fact that he's printed these lists of fraud that he supposedly found that are untrue, that he keeps mentioning things that he's cut, which turn out to be fake... No, there were not $50,000 of condoms going to Gaza. No, there was not money being paid to Chelsea Clinton. No, there was no money that was being paid to Politico , the website. So they keep claiming to be doing things. And so all of which leads me to conclude that as I suspected the Department of Government Efficiency is not really interested in efficiency. What it's interested in is what you have to call regime change. It's interested in changing the civil service, politicizing it, politicizing the state. It's what political scientists call ""state capture,"" and they are, and that's the program. And I wrote this in The Atlantic , but it's also... I wrote about it in Twilight of Democracy in 2020. I wrote about it in the context of Poland, like what was motivating it and what made people support it, but it's, again, not that original. It's been done a lot of times and places. The original piece is the way Musk is doing it. That's very radical and new. And I would say for me, I expected Trump acquiescent and Trump loyal people to be put in places like DOJ and the FBI and DOD and the Defense Department."
7GV3y_Dw2Wt,17230,Anne Applebaum,"You have to redo it so that it works for your circumstances. I have also been in, last September, I was in an underground control room where dozens of soldiers, mostly wearing t-shirts, were sitting in front of computers, and they essentially had the whole frontline. They could see the whole frontline, and they were coordinating drone operations across the front line from this place. That kind of stuff, that's how the war is really being fought. And obviously the Ukrainians need bullets and they need the long-range missiles. There's a lot of stuff they need US intelligence, but a lot of the war is they're better prepared to fight it than you think they are, just because the nature of the war has changed. The most important things to supply Ukraine with are going to be air defense so that they can continue pushing back against Russian air attacks. And by the way, a couple of days ago, the Russians launched one of the largest air attacks that they've launched in the entire war. It was something more than 260 different kinds of drones and missiles. And that's from somebody who- they'd just been negotiating with the Americans in Riyadh. So the Russians aren't showing any indication that they want to stop. But the Ukrainians are able to hit thousands of Russian targets every month."
bXjj5TEfl_0,17750,Anne Applebaum,"He will be pro- defense. He will pro-Ukrainian. He will want to work with France and Britain and Poland and others to create some kind of new defense alliance within the various alliances. And so, I am going to be positive today and I'm going to say it's a good thing. Yeah. I want to get to the alliances and the rest of Europe in a second. Just one more note on Germany itself. I guess I'm struck that-we're speaking Monday morning right after the Sunday elections-they fell a little, well yeah 20.7% of vote or something like that, the AFD, Alliance for Deutschland. Incidentally, Vance's intervention was more direct. He supported the AFD. Certainly, on Twitter and said nice things about them repeatedly before coming to even to Munich. And of course, Musk was just all in including putting a heavy thumb on the scale in terms of X. Algorithms. Yeah... what was Twitter. There's a very interesting study that showed the degree to which it's not just, oh, the algorithms naturally lead to a certain kind of extremism, which is probably true incidentally as well. But that they actually, if you had a neutral test, so to speak, they push towards the, I guess we're not quite supposed to call it a neo-Nazi party, but I call it an anti- anti-Nazi party."
9HLjxR1ZfCw,18150,Anne Applebaum,"They had many, many friends and colleagues across the military and across the US government. If General Milley to take an obvious example in 2020 had resigned, all the other chiefs would've resigned. A ton of three-star generals would've resigned. Maybe the Secretary of State would've felt he had to resign, Pompeo. I mean, the degree to which Trump has got people who have no authority or independent standing. I think your own work on autocracy has emphasized that point, and he's gone further in that direction, I guess, than even I expected. I think it's also really important to understand that this is not a conservative movement. It's not even... I wouldn't even say it's a right-wing movement. I mean, it's the wrong way to think about it. It's something... This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are not based in reality. They are skeptical of science. They're skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. And so there's a qualitative difference. You see, online, people saying, ""Oh, well, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement."" No, this is not."
t9-spxiXDoc,17270,Anne Applebaum,"Okay, great. Well, anyway, hopefully, that's... Well, I won't even go into whether that should be... Hopefully, Gulag is part of history and it's not as much part of history maybe as we hoped and thought when the book came out, but here we are. But thank you for everything you've been writing and doing. Thank you for joining me on Conversations . Thank you. Thank you all for joining us."
DjH8tdUMfei,17355,Anne Applebaum,"And that's from somebody who- they'd just been negotiating with the Americans in Riyadh. So the Russians aren't showing any indication that they want to stop. But the Ukrainians are able to hit thousands of Russian targets every month. I've seen the list of what they can hit. They are killing far more, something like seven to one. So they kill seven times more Russians than Ukrainians. They are in a position to continue fighting, I would guess, for at least six months and maybe a year without that much more help. So it's not as dire as you think. I mean, the thing that worries me the most about Ukraine is a psychological, what will it mean to Ukrainians if the US government turns on them? Will people become demoralized? That I just don't know. Wars have also psychological elements, and the Ukrainians, that's why they pushed back against the Russians in 2022. This is why Kiev wasn't taken because the Ukrainians said, ""No, we're brave and we're going to stop them,"" and they did. And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards."
HcxtWWeotDt,18272,Anne Applebaum,"I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress? And I'm the last person to put any hopes in them at this point, but half of them did vote for aide for Ukraine less than a year ago. Are they literally going to, just because Trump decides he's... Not decides. Trump has been a friend of Putin's and remains a friend of Putin's so to speak, or an ally Putin's almost. Are they simply going to give up on that? It wouldn't take that many Republicans to join the Democrats to conceivably stop Trump from doing a [aid] package, even? I guess I'm slightly more hopeful than some people that... I mean, generally presidents have a huge amount of power on foreign policy, very hard to override them when they're going at a certain direction. And sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time, it's very bad, I think. But I don't know. So for whatever it's worth my sense of if it could snowball in a very bad direction, or the opposite could happen. If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful."
SY_nW-ELHdc,17982,Anne Applebaum,"Buying certain kinds of American products or big investments, investing in American defense technology, by accepting the dominance of American tech companies. All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another. And really very suddenly all that looks different. And I can't tell you right now exactly what the implications will be or whether it can be reversed by further actions down the line. I mean, I suspect among other things that Putin doesn't really want to end the war. And so, I don't know exactly what the... I still have no idea what Trump is talking about when he says the war will end this week or it'll end by May. I'm not sure what he means. But all those things suddenly begin to look different. And the conversations happen in all kinds of contexts. So in boardrooms, in government offices, everyone who deals with the United States in any context is suddenly saying, ""Wait, are all the assumptions that I've based 30 years of decisions on or 80 years of decisions on, are all those assumptions wrong?"" And again, maybe this is going to be reversed and maybe it's not going to be as extreme as people think."
C9AqZQrWpHC,16803,Anne Applebaum,"People were doing different kinds of jobs three years ago, and yet they have put up this extraordinary defense. I mean, I think whatever happens next, the example Ukraine has set other societies for how you resist autocracy and how you stand up to violence and brutality. I mean, it's a great example for all of us. It's a beacon of hope. Well, thank you, Anne. That was really lovely, and I hope we don't succeed in betraying them, and I rather think we might not be... Trump may not be quite able to pull this off as much as he might like to. So thank you for those words about Ukraine. Thank you for the analysis, obviously of Europe and the US autocracy, democracy. Thanks really for everything you've been writing over the long time since we've known each other, and you've been writing on this for a long time back in the eighties and nineties, that Gulag , such a wonderful book, really authoritative book. When was that published? It was 2003. I was working on it in the nineties. Okay, great. Well, anyway, hopefully, that's... Well, I won't even go into whether that should be... Hopefully, Gulag is part of history and it's not as much part of history maybe as we hoped and thought when the book came out, but here we are."

And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
cWwnlQWAyEX,7050,Invisible Rulers,"I would argue that that same concern about what happens when China controls your feed, right? That was the topic around TikTok, is what happens when a CEO you don't trust controls your feed? What happens when Elon Musk controls your feed, right? Because Elon Musk owns Twitter. And right now you can... And I am not saying that Elon Musk is doing anything nefarious, but the point is... I'll say that. You can not say that. RENÉE DIRESTA: But the point is, Elon Musk, when he bought Twitter, significantly changed how content was weighted in the feed, right? ""Blue checks"" all of a sudden were for sale, and their content would be ranked higher, their replies would be ranked higher, and people could monetize. And what I was referencing earlier, influencers who wanted to make money wanted to be more sensational, and then the algorithm would curate that, would curate that content, because people would engage with it. And so you would see a very different style. Like your feed, when people say, ""My feed on X is totally different now,"" that's because the incentives are different and the way that it's ranked is different. And the person who controls that is X, which is now owned by one person. So what's the alternative? It's to move to platforms where you have better control over your own feed."

So, the one thing social media does offer is the opportunity for instantaneous counter speech. Whereas what happens with Coughlin is, they try to make him pre-clear his broadcast. So they've essentially appoint an official censor to go there and see if he's cleared to speak, which kind of has some parallels to content moderation. They have a person, essentially a fact-checker, come on right after him to say, ""Father Coughlin lied to you about the following things."" And then eventually, the Catholic Church kind of yanks him and is like, ""Okay, you're done."" And I tell the story in the book in kind of greater detail because it really is an incredible parallel to the modern moment. On social media, the theory is that counter- Just on the thirties for a second. Of course, the counter, that worked out okay in the US ultimately, sort of. Mostly- RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, I mean there was a war. Yeah. Well, no. And the reason there was war is because of Hitler mostly.

There's no evidence offered beyond the theory, but that's where we've kind of gotten to. Well, or some sort of fake evidence of some, as you say, misread spreadsheet.

So there is a decontextualized fact that serves as the evidence to backstop the conspiracy theory, basically. Yeah. No, that's very interesting. Conspiracy and trust, were you going to say any more on that? RENÉE DIRESTA: Oh, yeah. I was supposed to remind you. I'm dutifully doing my job here. I'm very... Yes. RENÉE DIRESTA: No, the trust point is exactly that, right? It is that we live in very different universes at this point, where if you... Because eroding confidence in institutions and repositioning yourself as the source of authority and trust is good business for somebody who's trying to sell Twitter or Substack subscriptions or whatever. That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else."
M9cU5JElCoh,7118,Invisible Rulers,"So suddenly you feel like, ""Well, there are thousands of people who agree with me."" Whereas if you walked around your neighborhood and one person did agree, but then two people didn't, and the one who didn't seemed like an intelligent person and had some experience, you might change your mind. I guess how powerful is that both in, I don't know, magnification and intensification of belief? RENÉE DIRESTA: Yeah, it's a great question. It's called ""majority illusion."" And so majority illusion is the people who are around you shape what you think the majority opinion is, right? You see these stories where Trump wins and people are like, ""Whoa, how could that possibly have happened? Nobody I know voted for him."" In the case of the vaccine thing though, it's a great example because the only people who were posting about vaccines at the time, this was in around 2013, 2014 timeframe. 2014, 2015 was when we were trying to get this bill passed. Only the anti- vaxxers were posting. And that's because most people go and they get their kid vaccinated and nothing happens and they don't post about it. This is the same phenomenon with the flat earthers. You can find flat earth content, but not round-earth content because nobody is creating the round- earth Facebook group."
NJrVwUJLr9D,6919,Invisible Rulers,"And instead, what happened, unfortunately, is that... Speaking of Wall Street sayings, there's that Charlie Munger one, ""Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcomes."" And that's where you see, again, the incentives of social media unfortunately start to turn to all of these influencers who maybe start out as just sort of plucky people wanting to tell their vision of the truth to the world, eventually begin to... A lot of them begin to monetize, to sell a particular vision of reality to an audience, they wind up in this audience capture kind of process, and they begin to really reinforce kind of selling a particular message to a particular niche. And through the sort of process of curation, where an algorithm filters you in particular directions, you do start to see this reinforcement. And so the way I describe it in the book is, instead of this hegemonic propaganda that sells a vision of America to the entirety of America, you wind up with these people who are sort of selling a vision of a particular identity to a particular niche. And so you have these fragments that fight with each other instead of a more unified form of propaganda. I don't know which is worse. I kind of go back and forth on that, but that's the..."
3V3UGMqaY0h,6819,Invisible Rulers,"I've got to stipulate for human beings. RENÉE DIRESTA: Yes. But in the old days, if you were a conspiracy theorist about X, you wouldn't necessarily have entree, so to speak, or be forced into knowledge, even, of a conspiracy theory Y, right? So the scientific kooks would be in a different, the vaccine people would be in a world perhaps from the, I don't know, QAnon types and from other kinds of conspiracies. So that has to be one case in which the new mode of just the fact of the algorithm, I guess you'd say, the new mode of transmission of these things, both rewards conspiracies, because they stay online longer, as you were saying, and they are more passionate and intense and they do what the algorithm wants to optimize for. But also then, more of them would get sucked in than would have been the case once before, maybe. So it does seem like it's a case where it's... RENÉE DIRESTA: Yeah. Yeah. RENÉE DIRESTA: And again, what this was good for was actually bringing people together. We talk a lot about loneliness epidemics and things like this. So the positive vision for what this was supposed to do was to help people find groups. I had a baby in 2013, and it started showing me mom groups."
kmeMGy-TGuA,6851,Invisible Rulers,"Things are always changing. There's new features, new platforms. The stuff I was talking about earlier with regard to Bluesky, these new protocol-based platforms are a whole different type of architecture that's really interesting. AI changes constantly. That, I think, some of the trust issues get really serious there. It's very hard to know what to trust. There was this Kanye West Super Bowl ad that led to this terrible site with a swastika T-shirt. And then there was this video made in response, a highly, highly plausible, incredibly realistic looking video of celebrities wearing shirts with the middle finger up, alluding to it. And they really looked like the celebrities that we all know. And it turned out to be a deep fake. And so the law hasn't quite caught up in some ways, in ways that people's images are misused. But I think, again, it comes down to trust and adaptation, as far as the social media ecosystem. And participation. I really think- But you think this is what we see- Of course, it could go further in terms of the technology and deep fakes. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, the technology is just going to keep changing. But what we see, you don't think we're having on the verge of another fundamental change like we had in the '90s and 2000s?"
2Ll9ZMDaVlK,6721,Invisible Rulers,"Or could we be having a different social media right now? RENÉE DIRESTA: We could and we can. So yes, to some extent they do. But it's not Mark Zuckerberg in a room cackling with his finger on the ""I'm going to make it negative"" button in the way that it's sometimes kind of cartoonishly described. It's more- Sometimes cartoons are somewhat accurate, though. Sorry... RENÉE DIRESTA: I think... well, I don't know. I imagine you remember... Remember the ISIS days on Twitter? I feel like we kind of forget 10 years ago, but in 2014 timeframe, ISIS got very big on Twitter, speaking of propaganda. It was one of the first terrorist organizations that realized that this gave it a way to recruit, it could reach disaffected people. And it was very, very, very effective at propagandizing. It had an iconography. It had the black flag. It was very... Transmitting this powerful sort of brand that they built. I don't mean the beheading videos, I mean the sort of the video game-like ads that they would put out. And Twitter really struggled with it, with what to do about it. And I didn't struggle with it. I was like, ""Why aren't they taking it down?"" I felt like it was morally clear. But they saw it as like, ""Well, it's a global platform."

That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else. It's very divided, and that's why that sense of how do we put reality back together? Well, people who believe Elon, when he says that there was, what was it, 50 million in condoms to Gaza or something, that's just wild theories come out of nowhere. And the fact check doesn't reach people. It takes it to another level, as you say, when he's standing in the Oval Office, and then when a whole bunch of government organizations, and he's got huge people in government who want to keep him happy, have a big incentive to these things. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's actually that- And so it's not just Elon, it's the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary of DH, whoever. RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, it's that they can act on them now. So 10:30 this morning was the RFK Jr. confirmation hearing. I assume he sailed through. I assume it went through on party line. Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised when we're done. I doubt it. But now we have a person who has been propagating the vaccines cause autism conspiracy theory leading Health and Human Services."
-5W8ssUhLkD,3011,Ryan Goodman,"It's not predicated on riots. It's predicated on violence or political protests. The part of the executive order that applies across the country that's anticipatory or preemptive also is only based on protests, if there is a threat of protests. So that's how extreme that is. Back to your particular question of what can the courts do about it, at some level I was a little surprised even that Judge Breyer at the District Court did try to stop on the administration from the federalization of the Guard because courts give so much deference to the executive branch. There's also some indication from the Court of Appeals panel, even though they find in favor of the Trump administration, that they say, ""We're also not going to accept the Trump administration's position,"" which is that this is all complete and deference political question doctrine, that the court shouldn't be involved. That they do some analysis of the facts, which I think is positive, but courts are weak in this particular space. To me, it's one of their spaces in which courts... one should not rely on the courts. I don't have faith that the Supreme Court is going to push back against the power of a president to say that there's a national emergency and need to bring out the National Guard to protect federal buildings, federal functions."
xGUbccai0CB,3012,Ryan Goodman,"Maybe I'm wrong though. I don't know. And how much of this is a choice and how much of this is just the courts can't stop a lot of stuff. Yeah. No. Yeah. So I do think... a number of thoughts on it. One, as you say, that is their theory of the case that he can do it whenever, and it really is. So one of the things I'm tracking are these extremist positions that the administration, the DOJ is taking before the courts. So on the federalization of the Guard, the DOJ before Judge Breyer in California in the district court level, in fact says, and I think it's multiple times, but it says in the oral argument, one of the hearings, ""The president can do this on the basis of no evidence."" No evidence that it's needed to have the Guard protect ICE agents or buildings, on the basis of no evidence. And Judge Breyer says, ""Really, you're making the argument they can do it on the basis of no evidence?"" And they're like, ""No, that's our argument, no evidence."" I mean, that's one part of the extremity of it. And then the second one, which you mentioned, Bill, which is that their briefs say that it's just if there's some inability to carry out law enforcement functions, and admittedly, the State of California has a little bit of the other extreme, so they're like, oh no, if it's completely impossible to carry out the functions."
8QWBcgnj2ws,2884,Ryan Goodman,"And it's just the intimidation and the intimidation is enough to chill other actors if they don't group together in solidarity. And Rebecca Hamilton wrote an amazing piece at Just Security a couple months back about how the universities need to act in solidarity, the law firms need to act in solidarity, drawing from experiences of other countries in which civil society has done so against anti-democratic forces in the government. So I think that's a huge part of what's happening and how law can vindicate certain rights, but it is also really only one piece of the democratic pushback because it doesn't fully, it's not fully effective given the intimidation, the chilling effects that can happen. So that's one piece of it. And then just to highlight, I think another aspect as to where we are right now in the country, the weaponization of the Justice Department, the weaponization of the White House, there's so many pieces of that to highlight, but the ways in which Donald J. Trump goes after enemies and perceived enemies by using the power of the government to me is illustrated in something that I haven't seen anybody else, references that might just be that I haven't read widely enough. Just something that recently happened and I was writing it up, I was just describing it for something and then in writing it up, I was like, oh, my God, look at what I'm actually writing."
6gb7myNAvkm,2893,Ryan Goodman,"We'll never take orders from the President."" She knew that that's what she needed to say, just to sail through the nomination hearing. And here we are so many months in and the executive orders themselves time and again, in the writing it actually says that he's ordering the Justice Department and the Attorney General to investigate the firms and all sorts of other things like that. And the Supreme Court has allowed for all of that. That's the tight unitary executive model. And that's the quote, ""new normal."" But hopefully through conversations like this one, people will not accept it and will in a certain sense, take a step back to see the bigger picture of where we're at, where you start to connect the different data points. Maybe we close with where do you think we're going? I mean, maybe, I don't know what the reasonable time horizon is. Six months, 18 months, three and a half years? But one can imagine I guess the Supreme Court having hedged quite a lot and bent over backwards, from your point of view and mine, I think doing certain things that would think, okay, there are some red lines and one could imagine maybe some even within the administration, one could imagine not continuing in this way we're going right now."
N9IrjpjhmYT,3154,Ryan Goodman,"So, I think Trump is supercharged after that opinion as he did with a performance with a press conference. So, that's where I think it's not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House. Yeah, it seems like they haven't given him that many victories on the big substance yet. Perhaps whether it's Humphrey's Executor will be radically limited, or struck down, and we'll see what happens on some of these other Alien Enemies Act, even some of them that presumably might go against Trump, presumably on the executive order on birthright citizenship. But certainly procedurally, I guess is the way I think of it. Maybe I'm simple minded, but they're giving him the benefit of the doubt an awful lot. And again, maybe in a very narrow sense, some of those decisions are their judgment calls, or whatever. It's a matter of court procedure. It's not a of high constitutional principle, but the effect of it is to let him go very far in practice down the path he's on without the courts being able, while curbing really the ability of the lower courts to do much to stop him. And in that context, that DVD decision at the beginning of last week, so that was the sixth three decision on Monday, I guess before the six-three decision on Friday that you mentioned the CASA decision."
eHzoRD_lh1z,2973,Ryan Goodman,"And then Secretary Rubio boasts that they've sent more flights out, and the government comes into court, and says, ""Well, Judge Murphy, your order was for the named defendants, which is DHS, and DOJ"", and it didn't name the military, and those are military flights. And so he clarifies his order. He doesn't do new orders like clarifying like ""No, no, no. It applies to the DOJ obviously facilitated the military flights"", for example, and DHS did. Like, how did those people get onto the flight? And so, the Supreme Court is giving a blessing to all of that. It's not even touching that. No explanation for it, et cetera. My hope is in a certain sense that the reason that the court did what it did is a very technical reason, and that it's one of Judge Murphy's orders was nationwide, and the other orders were not, they were specific to the people who were on the flight to South Sudan. And that's what the court was doing because they were about to issue the CASA decision on nationwide injunctions. But here we are a few days out from the CASA decision, if that's the explanation, where are we? They didn't do that. And then other immigration cases as well, which the court is not being great on immigration for decades now."
xEYrc8tmVXl,2857,Ryan Goodman,"Now, maybe Senator Tillis who's on the Judiciary Committee will behave differently. So there's me holding onto a little bit of that hope with respect to the Bove-like appointments or career appointments. And we've seen it once with Ed Martin going down in a ball of flames, and thanks then to Senator Tillis, but it's just so astonishing and I think it's astonishing in terms of a next chapter that we're also thinking about. I'm sure you're thinking about it, I'm thinking about it, which is Supreme Court vacancies. Well, say a word about that. That's a good thing to close on since it's a dramatic thing, and it could happen soon, right? I don't know. Yeah, I think it could happen this summer. I could imagine that Justice Thomas for example, or Alito, would think, ""Now is my moment to step down because the president is at his most powerful."" Certainly pre-midterms, that might go the other direction in terms of where the country's at with the Senate locked up for him in the way they are, with them approving people if they do approve people like Bove, without it creating a rupture. So I think it's such an important moment that's coming for the country because of how critically important that life tenure position is, so that the country also does understand how the current Supreme Court in its six-three makeup is behaving and the way in which it's greasing the slide away from a democracy that we can all recognize."
M8QhXqLctcn,2885,Ryan Goodman,"I think it's the San Francisco Chronicle that obtained the full letter in which she was asking the military to perform clear law enforcement functions of arrests. I mean, that is such a red line and so well established. I can't begin to describe how egregious that is that you'd use the military for those purposes that are in her letter. And she has a general counsel that you would think would have to sign off on those kinds of requests. But when I say red line, once again, the most out there aggressive reading of executive authority inside the Justice Department, inside the Office of Legal Counsel on this very question of use of the military domestically has always drawn the line that they cannot engage in those kinds of activities like arrests. This comes from Office of Legal Counsel opinions dating back 1960s. And then they start to get into these ones that are like landmark opinions by Judge, formerly, William Rehnquist when he was in the head of their OLC, Office of Legal Counsel. Over decades, they've drawn that line. So that's her just breaking right through it. And then, to me, the greatest worry is what we're seeing in the country. I mean, we are seeing things that I would never have imagined. You've spoken about it much more eloquently than I have, Bill, which is masked militarized forces on American streets snagging people and putting them in the back of vans."
1qvhl7P8GJ8,2935,Ryan Goodman,"Trump could be weaker, there could be more Republican defections. I guess there could be fewer Republican... It's hard to say, there could be fewer Republican defections, so yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Well, that would be something. Well, if that happens, we'll have an emergency conversation here and discuss, because that would be very interesting, the Supreme Court fight. But this has been terrific, Ryan. Thank you. Really, it's a very educational and important, I think, conversation, and thank you for taking the time to do it. Thank you so much. I look forward to the next one. Me too and thank you all for joining us on Conversations."
YPwm0GTRZr0,2953,Ryan Goodman,"Just something that recently happened and I was writing it up, I was just describing it for something and then in writing it up, I was like, oh, my God, look at what I'm actually writing. Can you believe this? Because we've normalized it and here's what it was. Elon Musk threatens that he will help people primary Republicans who vote for the massive spending bill. He threatens that and then he threatened it again. And he threatened not just that again, but then he most recently last like 48 hours, threatened that he would create a third party. What happens within 12 to 24 hours? Donald Trump on Truth Social says, oh, well, we're now going to use DOGE to look into all of the government contracts and support for Elon Musk's companies. And that's just, excuse me, that's just fucking crazy that the President of the United States is going to try to directly penalize somebody for political activity. Elon Musk is fully within his rights if that's what he'd like to do. And all he's saying is expressing political views and using his political muscle and the President of the United States, it doesn't even do it silently as Richard Nixon might've done, but he is publicly saying, we're going to retaliate against you in a way that's unethical, illegal, and the rest of it."
WoHA5jaVU-L,4037,Eric Edelman,"He is got a Ukrainian presence in Kursk which is under pressure, and the Russians are taking back territory, but more slowly than they are in Eastern Ukraine. So it's not a great... and the economy's in terrible shape. He is relying on North Korean soldiers because he doesn't want to have a full mobilization because he is afraid of what the political effects would be in St. Petersburg, in Moscow if he did that. So he's under pressure too. And so I can imagine him wanting to get some kind of respite, and I can imagine him thinking he can work it around so that he gets a ceasefire under maximally advantageous conditions to Russia. He can then rebuild, reconstitute, and then go after Ukraine again in a couple of years. Interesting. One word on Europe, since you served there in Prague and elsewhere, followed it very closely from when you were back at the State Department here at home and Defense. It seems like German government just fell, they'll have elections. The French government presidency is very weakened as they keep turning over Prime Ministers. Problems elsewhere. Also, problems in Central Europe as well and Eastern Europe, different kinds of governments, different flavors. Hungary, without going through everything, which we can't, what...I guess Trump will just... I don't know, what do you think there?"
Q32z29xAEZv,3900,Eric Edelman,"But maybe before we get to that, which we should in two minutes say a word about Turkey, which has been a big player on the Syrian front and in other areas, and weird kind of... if I'm a new president, I don't know... I guess Trump likes Erdogan, but it's part of NATO, but it's also a big problem for us with terror ties. What's the bottom line of where Turkey is and how we should think about it? Yeah, so Turkey is the big winner, certainly coming out of the Syria episode, the collapse of Assad. I mean, it's interesting. This is, I think, maybe Hegel's cunning of history at work here, because Erdogan, who liked the Saudis for a long time was pushing for an end to the Syrian regime, although he had a different outcome in mind, he preferred an outcome in which the Muslim Brotherhood would be the big winner. And the Saudis obviously had a different outcome in mind, but Erdogan also, like others, was making his peace with the fact that Assad had survived and was looking also to normalize relations with Assad. But he had certain asks, which included return of the almost four million Syrian refugees living in Turkey from the Civil War back to Syria. And this was important to Erdogan because all of Erdogan's foreign policy is rooted in his domestic political situation, and he just had suffered the biggest reverse this spring that he's ever suffered in municipal elections."
BpYCAfcsnQN,3988,Eric Edelman,"Erdogan prevailed on Trump to pull US forces back. Trump tried to get them all out, the so-called adults in the room, Jim Mattis and others, kept this small force there. Whether they'll be able to prevail on him a second time, up in the air, but Erdogan also had, like the Saudis, a family-to-family relationship with the Trump family. And the Trump organization, of course has business interests in Istanbul. Again, this was a son-in-law-to-son-in- law relationship. How much of that stays in place with Jared Kushner formally outside the administration? Little hard to tell, but as you say, yes, the relationship with Erdogan was a very cozy one, and that could have a role here. So keeping an eye on Trump's decision to seal down those troops in Syria is another little thing that people haven't focused on that could be quite a big deal early on. And he could be under some pressure from his own people who want to get US troops out of all these places since we shouldn't be involved in Middle East wars. Yikes. So after Trump gets this briefing on the Middle East, it'll occur to someone for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. He'll be impatient anyway, but it'll occur to someone that will, ""Hey, it's the largest land war in 80 years that's going out of Europe, and that you've pledged to end, Mr."
xnVIFml6r3R,4217,Eric Edelman,"Who knows what might happen? I think a lot of unexpected things can happen. The Russian army could crack under the strains it's under; the Ukrainian army could crack. They're in extremis right now. So, you could get a catastrophic collapse on the battlefield of some sort or other. I'm not predicting that; I'm just saying these are the kinds of things that could happen. You could get a collapse of the North Korean regime. The Assad regime, nobody thought it was going to collapse in two weeks. These regimes always look strong, but they're completely fragile and on the inside. Russia is more fragile than we think. Think back to the Prigozhin mutiny, I think it's arguable that had Prigozhin not lost his nerve, he might have actually taken Moscow. So, all of these things are out there. The Chinese still spend more on internal security than they do on external security, which is an indication of how concerned the leaders are about their own populace. It's the nature of all of these regimes. The Iranian regime, the collapse of Assad and the success of the Israeli retaliation rate in Iran have exposed, I think, the fragility of that regime, which is loathed by the majority of the population. So, the potential for upheaval, unanticipated shifts is always out there and tends to impose itself on every administration that comes in."
r-tYVzCdcQb,4155,Eric Edelman,"So if there's anything that Donald Trump understands, it's strength and weakness. So it depends on who's going to be briefing him, of course. But one would think that Mike Walz and Marco Rubio, who have traditionally been pretty firm supporters of Ukraine or were at the outset of the war, less so this past year when they were among those who voted against the April assistance package, but who certainly understand the dynamics here. There is a possibility that Trump might see it in his interest to strengthen Ukraine in order to get Putin to the table and get a negotiated settlement. But on the other hand, you can also see certain forces saying, ""Just cut off the Ukrainians,"" the Tucker Carlson.... The next tranche of aid expires fairly early in the Trump administration... Not expires, but gets exhausted. It's hard to imagine, Trump's the president who asked for more aid for Ukraine after everything we've been through with the Republicans on The Hill and with Trump and Vance and so forth. Maybe that's possible, but I suppose that... Anyway, that moment of truth will be a 2025 moment of truth. Yeah, and there are a couple of points here. So the Biden administration has been trying to get as much of the assistance that was approved last April out the door as it can, and the assistance comes in two flavors."
CVPuEwgGGNC,3912,Eric Edelman,"It's still not huge swaths of territory. So it's easy to over-exaggerate how badly it's going, and the cost to the Russians has been absolutely extraordinary. The British Chief of Defense, Tony Radakin, gave a speech at RUSI a few weeks ago, which he suggested that the losses may be as high as 700,000 killed and wounded, with the killed up around 150,000. This is just incredible losses that the Russians are taking. Not clear how long they can sustain that. The Russian economy is overheating. Putin had to answer a lot of questions about inflation from average Russian citizens. The Financial Times had a lovely story about the Russian economy a couple of weeks ago in which they talked about grocery stores putting butter under lock and key because it's so hard to get ahold of and the price is so high. And the events in Syria as well, and the weakening of Iran. Syria was a major Russian client, and to have Assad taken off the board and flee to Moscow is an indication of Putin's weakness. So if there's anything that Donald Trump understands, it's strength and weakness. So it depends on who's going to be briefing him, of course. But one would think that Mike Walz and Marco Rubio, who have traditionally been pretty firm supporters of Ukraine or were at the outset of the war, less so this past year when they were among those who voted against the April assistance package, but who certainly understand the dynamics here."
GO14wPg8TaB,3847,Eric Edelman,"The thing that I worry about is that I think he could be tempted into a negotiation. And if you look at the negotiation that he conducted with the North Koreans in his first term as president, he had one meeting with Kim Jong Un and then said the nuclear threat from North Korea has gone away. That was obviously nonsense, that nothing had actually really been accomplished, in fact, other than the United States making some preemptive concessions by canceling some US South Korean joint exercises that got the North Koreans out of joint a little bit. So he did not solve the problem. And I worry that if he gets into a negotiation, he will be so focused on cutting a deal, no matter what kind of deal it is, it'll be the greatest deal ever. Whether or not it actually solves the problem, that's the real danger and temptation. This is the first conversation I was thinking just I've had on foreign policy with you or lots of other people where we've gone 20 minutes for interesting discussion and haven't mentioned Ukraine or Putin. But maybe before we get to that, which we should in two minutes say a word about Turkey, which has been a big player on the Syrian front and in other areas, and weird kind of... if I'm a new president, I don't know..."
m1MiR1NPkON,4153,Eric Edelman,"And of course, he won't have most of anyone confirmed at the beginning, and he may not get some of these secretaries confirmed at all. And Hegseth, I suppose, or Gabbard. And then of course, second and third tier people, even in a normal administration, take a while to confirm. Maybe this Republican Senate will be very, very solicitous and get them through fast. But yeah, I think the degree of just the combination of chaos and to be fair to them, challenges they inherit or they confront and their own management style of course, and then things that could happen and adversaries may be looking at the situation and thinking this is a pretty good time to... But if you're Putin, don't you think, ""Look, I'm going to call Trump on January 22nd. He wants an early victory. I'm going to make it pretty attractive to him here, to have a negotiation with me at a summit, and we're really going to make this happen,"" and he'll find some fake concession he didn't make before, or something like that? I don't know, maybe not. Or maybe he'll do the opposite attitude. Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine. Ultimately, he'd like to march into Kiev and maybe he'll decide Trump is preoccupied and dealing with budget government shutdowns, and he can just stiff-arm Trump and end up winning everything at 18 months."
_ZZhZt0lUF_,3887,Eric Edelman,"I don't know, maybe not. Or maybe he'll do the opposite attitude. Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine. Ultimately, he'd like to march into Kiev and maybe he'll decide Trump is preoccupied and dealing with budget government shutdowns, and he can just stiff-arm Trump and end up winning everything at 18 months. I don't know. It seems to me very unpredictable, both in terms of what we do, but in terms of what others do as they face us. Putin said the other day that he is looking forward to speaking to Trump, that he has not spoken to him recently, that it's been quite a while since they last spoke. I expect that he will try and actually try and move in the direction you've suggested, that he will tell Trump, ""I am open to negotiation. I'm prepared to make some kind of deal,"" and count on Trump's lack of interest in details to work this in the most favorable way to Putin. Look, Putin is under some pressure as well. As I said, he's having a certain amount of battlefield success, but on the other hand, he's got Russian Generals being blown up in the streets of Moscow. He is got a Ukrainian presence in Kursk which is under pressure, and the Russians are taking back territory, but more slowly than they are in Eastern Ukraine."
a9qeABLO_TL,3814,Eric Edelman,"And apparently, the Turks gave Ahmed al-Sharaa, who goes by the nom de guerre, Mohamed Abu al-Jolani, family from the Golan Heights, and therefore al-Jolani, gave him the green light to go ahead with a limited military operation to take back the second-biggest city in Syria, which is Aleppo, and this resulted in catastrophic success. And they not only took Aleppo, it became clear that the regime was really hollowed out and fragile. They were able to negotiate surrenders and then in rapid succession, Aleppo, and then the other big cities, two of which had been the sites of enormous massacres by Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, Hama and Homs, these places 40 years ago were leveled and destroyed by Assad in an effort to wipe out the Muslim Brotherhood in those areas. Those fell and then ultimately Damascus fell and Assad fled to Moscow. Now, Turkey is clearly the big winner here. They'll have enormous influence with HTS, obviously. They're also going to play a very big role in the reconstruction of Syria because Turkish construction companies have been very active throughout the region. They're very good. And so they will almost certainly be involved in the reconstruction of Syria. So he will have outsized influence. He won't be dispositive. He won't be able to tell them exactly what to do, but he will be the most influential foreign player in Syria."
7GMWFluo2OM,15977,John Bolton,"Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist."
FBRVqt4iLvr,12777,John Bolton,"So for example, the Office of Legal Counsel, often called the President's lawyer's lawyer. They're like General Counsel of the Justice Department to the Attorney General. They've researched a lot of precedents over the years, and if Trump decides he wants to override them, they're going to have to roll over the Office of Legal Counsel. And that's perhaps one of the first places you could see a lot of resignations in justice of career lawyers, or hopefully a few political appointees just aren't going to do it. The Solicitor General's Office is similar in many respects. People refer to that as the Supreme Court's 10th Justice. Well, that's not how Donald Trump's going to see it. That's for sure. And so there could be arguments there, but I think the main place is where the rubber meets the road. So let's take a concrete example. When the President says to Pam Bondi, ""I want John Kerry prosecuted."" Let's pick Liz Cheney. Let's say, ""I want-"" John Bolton. We can do... It could be anyone. Yeah, it's a long list. Let's put it that way. ""I want Liz Cheney prosecuted for what she did on the January 6th committee or what she said about this, or because I don't like color of her eyes,"" or whatever the reason is. Pam Bondi isn't going to bring the prosecution."
XOzz6ix91VO,13020,John Bolton,"And from other departments and so forth. Nixon IRS-type things, obviously, but also the degree of internal crisis of governance we could have. Don't you think- That's exactly right. It'll make the Saturday Night Massacre look like a tea party because the number of enemies he wants to prosecute is so large that this is really going to overload the Justice Department system. In other departments, you could see similar things. For example, Trump decides to order the 82nd Airborne onto the streets of Portland Oregon because he doesn't like what's going on. Who knows what his reason is? But the Posse Comitatus law, which generally prohibits the use of the military and law enforcement, is a very strong and important tradition. What's Pete Hegseth going to do? He is just going to say, ""Yes, sir?"" Maybe so. So, he then turns to the pertinent military commander and says, ""Do this."" What's that military commander going to do if he's got a legal opinion from some career Department of Defense lawyer that says that violates Posse Comitatus, you know officers are not supposed to carry out illegal orders. That's why Lieutenant Calley got prosecuted for the My Lai Massacre. You don't carry out orders to do that sort of thing. Are they going to refuse to carry out an illegal order?"
QHUN194XwtD,13315,John Bolton,"When Mel Laird was Secretary of State for Richard Nixon, David Packard of Hewlett- Packard was the deputy, and everybody said, ran it in a very significant way. But nonetheless, Hegseth has got to convince Republicans, who have dealt with many of the people that you mentioned, that he can be up to the job. Whether he can do it or not is anybody's guess. And again, I'm just leaving the personal stuff out, which could be disqualifying on its own. Just as a professional matter, it's not on his resume now. People forget there will be these confirmation... It's all happened so fast. It's not Thanksgiving yet, and the old Congress is still not in session exactly, but in power and authority, until the new Congress convenes on January 3rd or 4th or whatever it is, right after the new year. And that's when the confirmation hearings begin. Right? Right. And I assume those will happen, and some of them will happen in those first two weeks before the inauguration. Sometimes a few of them happen the week or two after, but usually, they try to do it in January. Yeah, no, in past administrations, many people have been confirmed on the 20th of January, they hold the hearings, they had the FBI background checks. The President turns over the nominations, maybe before lunch, after the inauguration, the Senate votes 10 or 12 of them through."
Q9-O04FIhoB,12703,John Bolton,"What are these Trump picks going to say, ""Yes, sir, Mr. President, we're going to convene a grand jury and start subpoenaing people to indict John Kerry."" That'll be their test. And if they have any ethics, we'll find out soon enough. And I guess the scariest scenario is as I, who knows either there could be crises throughout that department, Justice is the most striking. But of course, it's true in other departments where people could be asked to pull funding from this project or give funding to a favor of Trump's and it's not in accord with the laws and the regulations. And then do the people who are resisting just get fired? Does Pam Bondi fired the criminal division who says no to fire the US attorney for whatever district it is, or they go to another district and find someone who is willing to indict Liz Cheney in that district? Or are they willing to indict the head of the NAACP somewhere in Texas? And I mean, I think people who haven't thought through the degree of actual, I mean, A, some bad things can happen in terms of actually prosecuting and persecuting and people and money going to where it shouldn't go. And from other departments and so forth. Nixon IRS-type things, obviously, but also the degree of internal crisis of governance we could have."
crM3f9sxTGB,13009,John Bolton,"That person, and really collectively, we've got to decide what the president's going to see. Well, with Tulsi Gabbard sitting there, who knows what she's going to say about the information, ""I don't believe that."" Or if Trump says, ""Don't put that out,"" or, ""Don't spread that around the intelligence community. Don't inform the Pentagon. Don't inform the State Department,"" it's a prescription that not only will serve Trump poorly, but it will hurt our entire intelligence gathering and transmission process. And then, that, in turn, impedes our decision-making in ways that we just can't calculate. She's not qualified for the job professionally. And I think that the strange statements she's made, which people like Mitt Romney have characterized as treasonous, really amounts to a kind of character defect too. You've worked closely with other nations in sharing intelligence and making foreign policy decisions, our allies in both Europe and Asia. What do they think when they see this? I think they're saying, ""My God, it's Trump all over again, only it's worse this time."" So the Director of National Intelligence, for most of his first term, was Dan Coats, former Republican Senator, former US Ambassador to Germany, somebody with a distinguished career, who understood politics, but also, understood intelligence. I think his foreign counterparts had confidence in him, as I think they had confidence in Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel, the two directors of the CIA."
U8_VJ-peqjG,13316,John Bolton,"So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly. And presumably the Gaetz example would embolden them a little bit in that? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I feel like that weakened Trump a little more than I realized. At the time, it was sort of that's smart of him to just pull it. You don't have the votes. You pull it. [inaudible] to the Hill on Wednesday, you pull him on Thursday, you don't have a week of drip, drip, drip, which is often what happens in these cases and all that. But I now think pulling it so quickly and without really even explaining anything and without defending him particularly or anything, or I don't know, maybe it looks a little bit like, ""Okay, if that can happen to Gaetz, it could happen to one or two others if you're sitting there on the Hill."" No, I think that's right. I mean, in part, this was Trump-induced because his people were saying, ""He's totally in charge. He's invincible. He's going to get whatever he wants. These 53 Republican Senators are just a bunch of lickspittles, and they'll acquiesce very quickly."" And then they didn't."
cwzeK645L_5,12600,John Bolton,"It's not inevitable that a defeat on a nominee hurts an incoming president. When George HW Bush nominated John Tower for defense Secretary and Tower went down, he nominated Cheney. Life moved on. For Trump, I think it's different because he's trying to portray the image of invincibility, that he won by a tremendous margin, which he didn't. He got a plurality of the votes and he won. This time, there's no dispute who won, but this is not a huge victory. This was not a landslide. And when the bubble of invincibility gets pierced, I think Trump could find himself moving very quickly from being a newly inaugurated president to the other reality, which is he's a lame duck the day he takes office. So I think good political advice would be don't fight fights you're bound to lose over somebody like Tulsi Gabbard. I mean, if you really want Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary, I don't think he'll have much opposition. You fight for that. You don't fight for the ones that are basically collateral. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly."
oP_CNz0EALm,13615,John Bolton,"I mean, he knows there's a lot of other stuff out there, but he doesn't really care about it. Department of Housing and Urban Development barely passes his radar screen education. These are just not things he cares about, but subordinates in the White House pursuing what they think his agenda is could cause a lot of turmoil in departments by the things they're doing. And that slows the work of everybody down. I mean, while I have you here ... I can't resist asking about Trump himself. You've spent more time with him than 99.99% of Americans and very intense times sometimes and very important issues in the Oval Office every day. A, I mean ... well, you wrote about him in the book, but the judgment, do you have a sense he's changed some? Anything you would say that those ... A lot of Americans saw him in the first term and decided they could live with that. Obviously, they voted for him, but it's four years later, I don't know. What's your sense? Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him."
a6ruGc6q8u5,12636,John Bolton,"Right. Yeah. Nixon didn't fire him. Trump might. Yeah. And then replace him with someone who you can get from god knows where. Right. It's not like he always replaces the secretary. Matt Gaetz is available for other assignments. Yeah. The Matt Whitaker type model where you take someone who's down eight layers or something at Justice, but as long as he's above a certain level, I guess the way the Vacancies Act works, you can make him acting secretary for some amount of time. But then again, the degree of chaos that breeds, of course, is who's in charge. And then people in the Senate start saying, ""Wait a second. You can't just have..."" I don't think people running these huge departments with no accountability to us. No. And that contributes indeed to the turmoil as Congress gets involved, which it inevitably will. And it could be Republicans getting involved when programs they happen to care about are being disrupted by this kind of turmoil inside the management of the executive branch. Trump doesn't really care so much about that because to him, really, it's like the West Wing is the executive branch. I mean, he knows there's a lot of other stuff out there, but he doesn't really care about it. Department of Housing and Urban Development barely passes his radar screen education."
UXcgYOXG7Jl,4822,Steve Vladeck,"So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments. The point is everything else. So the firing of probationary employees, many of whom are not actually probationary, right? Maybe many of whom were 15, 20-year veterans of their agencies who were just recently promoted. Right. Those are not the folks who are- Yeah, the way that works is you're ""probationary"" for a year when you're in a new position, I believe. But as you say, many of them were quite very experienced and in fact probably were among the better employees because they were put in these new jobs and more responsibility. Right. And this is the problem. I mean, so whatever you think of the law, and I think a lot of what Trump has done in this space is unlawful, right? But even if you aren't troubled by the legal constraints here, the folks who are being fired are the folks who are the real just force of these agencies, the productive force, the folks who have moved up in the agencies as they've gotten more and more sophisticated, more and more experienced."
IgMZ-qtQeMk,5184,Steve Vladeck,"And I think it's almost literally true that no one like that is there in the power agencies... is really ... That's been a wake- up call. And then the question becomes even if there is a reaction among the public, which I think there most likely will be, does it catch up to sort of the momentum of the internal destruction of norms and checks? And the answer sadly is going to be, it will never fully catch up. And we're going to no matter how things go from here, even on the optimistic account, we're going to look back at this period with a lot of regret and a lot of woe. But the critical point, and I think this is a point that is underscored by history, is the time to sort of lay down the marker and stand up is earlier rather than later, right? You fight the war, not when it's best for you to fight it. You fight the war when you can minimize the damage. And minimizing the damage isn't going to make everybody whole, but we should be all invested in minimizing the damage at this point as opposed to any scenario where Trump is given more of an opportunity to make it worse. No, that's so well said. It's a good note to end on."
IYo-5qnTuo2,4855,Steve Vladeck,"Bill, it has not been part of the unitary executive theory or arguments or push that the president can therefore fire the entire civil service. And so my own assumption is that this Supreme Court, and I mean the one we have right now, is not going to be especially in a hurry to stand up to Trump when it comes to firing people like Hampton Dellinger, the head of an agency, but actually is very much going to stand up for the civil service if and when we get a case to the court. The problem is that there's such this like, complicated labyrinthine administrative process for civil servants to challenge their firings that getting that case to the court could take some time. And I suppose as I understand it from Project 2025 and talking to John DiIulio and others about this who know a lot about the internal workings of the federal government, if something like Schedule F, which would vastly increase the number of political appointees, the Schedule C's I mentioned before, there's a schedule, there's also ABCD. This is F. This would be a new schedule, I think. Trump tried to do it at the very end of his first term, and it never went anywhere. But if there were 40,000 of them, instead of the four or 5,000, I think it is Schedule C's, that I think he has quite a lot of ability to just do on his own."
VAofc3juRq9,4790,Steve Vladeck,"Even this Senate, I think may not confirm him to that job. But Bill, historically, the limit on the government's ability to basically sort of so hyper politicize the enforcement process and not just the regulatory process has been the idea that the First Amendment protects against that kind of retaliation. The problem is that it is often, and thanks to the Supreme Court, especially, very difficult to establish that there is First Amendment retaliation because you have to show that there's some degree of selectivity. You have to show that the government's prosecuting you as opposed to someone with different views who committed the same crime. The good news here, and I think it is good news, is that President Trump is not, how do I say, strategic about what he says publicly. So for example, over the weekend when President Trump posted on social media about this Syrian national and former Columbia student who was arrested by immigration officers. That suggests a very, very specific level of targeting by the White House based on things that this particular person, Mahmoud Khalil has said. So Trump's, I guess it's a ""truth,"" is what he calls them. Trump's post is going to be an exhibit in the lawsuit saying, ""You can't do this because it violates the First Amendment."" That's going to be where the litigation happens."
75tn-NWKjRZ,4742,Steve Vladeck,"Yeah, I mean, the degree to which a lot of this can just slide. I'm struck by that. And I do feel like Trump blunders a lot, but they're also pretty clever. You mentioned their litigation strategy in terms of appeal to the Supreme Court, they seem to be laying the predicate for a lot of things kind of quietly. So I was very struck, Trump said, I think those attacks on the demonstrations, not demonstrations, but even the destruction of property at Tesla dealerships, which is presumably against the law and people could be arrested for destroying property. That's domestic terrorism. Now, I don't believe he actually signed an executive order saying that being anti-Musk, anti-Tesla is being part of like being part of a terrorist Hezbollah or something like that. But a friend of mine pointed this out to me, isn't he kind of laying the groundwork for expanding domestic terrorism? And there are... You know much more, Steve, than I do, but there are statutes where if you're part of an organization that has been labeled a terrorist organization, you don't have all kinds of rights or I mean, the government can do certain things against you that it can't do otherwise. I just feel like generally the kind of collapsing of all these limitations and the notion that no one has to make a factual showing also about anything."
hJJCDzbEh8T,4707,Steve Vladeck,"So just one note on the courts. I mean, it's interesting Bill, that we're 50 days into the administration and we have not seen a rash of judicial retirements. Usually, when you have a political turnover, a partisan turnover, a whole bunch of judges who were waiting for the next president from their side of the aisle to be elected come right to the front the line and say, ""I'm stepping down."" We haven't seen that, which I think is an interesting data point. So there are two ways that things go from here, right? One is better and one is worse. And the worst way is, as you say, that this just keeps escalating, that the rhetoric keeps dividing us, that Trump tries to do ever more and more controversial stuff, that the courts are not able to fully block it, that Congress completely rolls over, and that not 18 months from now, but six months from now, we're starting to see more violence on the streets. We're starting to see sort of controversial cases like the Khalil case that we saw over the weekend. And that's terrifying. And vigilantes acting at the President's encouragement or encouragement of someone from the US from the government, sort of protected by the expectation of the pardon power mean and merging in a way with some aspects of local law enforcement and even federal, isn't that?"
uyclR7LyuBe,5005,Steve Vladeck,"I don't know, presumably- Crimes. What? I mean, he's accused, right? He accused Representative Ocasio-Cortez of breaking the law, right? Yeah. He's accusing of breaking the law for their Congressional... for giving speeches. And so all this kind of craziness, the domestic terrorism on Tesla is kind of... One could see it being more extreme 18 months from now. A lot would depend on the courts and the Congress. I mean everything would depend I suppose, on the courts and Congress. Courts, of course, are a bit of a changing thing because Trump gets to make appointments, maybe not at the Supreme Court, depending on whether people retire but at the appellate and district court level. So I'm just curious, I mean, A, what do you think about the next, let's say this term of the court? I think that's an obvious moment to think about. And then more broadly the next year and a half in terms of sort of risks, what worries you the most? What kind of encourages you a bit, et cetera? So just one note on the courts. I mean, it's interesting Bill, that we're 50 days into the administration and we have not seen a rash of judicial retirements. Usually, when you have a political turnover, a partisan turnover, a whole bunch of judges who were waiting for the next president from their side of the aisle to be elected come right to the front the line and say, ""I'm stepping down."" We haven't seen that, which I think is an interesting data point."
VR5UWS9tFc-,5095,Steve Vladeck,"And at least since the 1880s, we've had a robust tradition of a civil service, of a statutorily and regulatory protected civil service where folks can earn protection from being fired, where we don't expect the janitor at the Department of Energy to be someone who's hired or fired because of their connections to the current president. Yeah. And the trade-off was, in a way they accepted perhaps lower salaries and less opportunities for big windfalls because they had the security of a government job. Now within that category, as someone who was chief of staff of a department, they were the Schedule C employees, the political appointees who were fireable, hireable at will basically and fireable at will. They were a rather small number- I mean, that's the key. ...were at least of this huge pyramid. And then there was this massive civil service space. So Trump is going way beyond, I mean of course every administration removed, if it comes in with succeeding the opposite party, pretty much all the Schedule C's leave and you put in your own Schedule C's. So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments."
dIhvdFaux86,4666,Steve Vladeck,"The other thing about the spending is that what we're talking about right now, Bill, is money that was appropriated for 2025. As you know, the Constitution requires appropriations to be annual. It's the only thing the Constitution requires Congress to do every year. Part of what's happening politically right now is the fact that Congress has to appropriate for 2026 and as opposed to everything Trump's been able to do in the first 50 days where he was acting against an existing body of appropriations. Now he needs new ones. We've reached the point where Trump has started to run out of the ability to do everything by himself and where now he actually needs some affirmative buy-in from Congress and I think that's part of what the showdown over the continuing resolution and potential government shutdown is really about, is is anyone in Congress going to take this first critical moment in which there's unquestionable leverage over the President to actually assert it? And going forward, let's just say at the end of the year, whether there's a CR or appropriations bills or whatever, it's the 30th. I suppose Congress could also go the other direction, the Republican Congress, rather than constraining the President and it could explicitly allow even more latitude in the kind of cases you mentioned."
FFpNjhWwwuJ,4696,Steve Vladeck,"When William Rehnquist was the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 1969, he wrote a memo disclaiming that power. When John Roberts was a lawyer in the White House counsel's office in 1985, he wrote a memo disclaiming that power. These are not the folks who you would expect to be coming out against this power in positions where they would be most sympathetic to the claim that the power existed and they're still resisting it. So, I don't- Can I just give you one...? It's my personal experience. Iran-Contra was a big scandal that people forget. This really almost did in the Reagan administration near the end. It was [inaudible] near the end, so it just ended up being a report and all that. Certainly people were fired and there were prosecutions and so forth. Literally, that was what this was about too, also of course though, right? Reagan was spending money that hadn't been appropriated for the Contras. And then lying about it, but details. Man, those were the days. All I'm saying is, no one thought in Reagan's White House counsel office to say what we did was fine and right and all these restraints are unconstitutional. It was all, ""we didn't do it. We didn't mean to do it. We didn't quite realize we were doing it."" That's what I mean when I say those were the days because the whole scandal was the effort to avoid the fact that what they did was illegal, as opposed to saying it wasn't illegal."
BdLTB_br1n_,6446,Aaron Friedberg,"If they do this or if they come to a moment when they're contemplating whether to do it, their decision is going to depend on an assessment of a whole array of factors of which the military ones are maybe not even the most important. They're going to be asking themselves in Beijing, how cohesive is the Democratic alliance? How strong is the US support for Taiwan? To what extent would US allies in the region come to our assistance? To what extent might our European allies do things, maybe not military things, but to support us and to oppose China if it tried to coerce or to conquer Taiwan. They're looking at all that. How effective could sanctions and embargoes be if they were imposed with force and speed as we did on Russia? All of that is going to be factored into the equation. And I guess my hunch is that their assessments of our political resolve and cohesion may ultimately be more important even than the military considerations, or once they reach a certain level of military capability, the judgment about whether to go or not to go is going to depend much more on these softer factors and their assessment of them than it is just on how many missiles and how many ships and so on."
v7EqKSHiyJ8,6249,Aaron Friedberg,"That's very interesting. Very, very helpful on that side of the equation, much clearer than most of the explanations I've seen. What about the flip side of the equation? Why not do more? Then there's reports now that our intelligence thinks they may be ready to do more. I take it we're trying to deter them from doing more, some people I know are surprised they haven't. They've done some sanctions busting, I suppose, and helping of Russia, but not everything. Do you agree? Not a lot of what they could have done. It's a wider relative restraint on the flip side of the equation. The things that they haven't done yet would be to overtly supply large quantities of arms and ammunition. And the two things that people are talking about as possible shifts in their policy, although there's no evidence of this that I'm aware of yet, would be providing Russia with artillery, ammunition and maybe weapons. Because they're using these at a tremendous rate and possibly also specifically military drones. Apparently, they've sold some civilian drones to the Russians, but they've been careful. And I believe the reason is that they don't want to run afoul of the United States and of our European allies. They don't want to find themselves the targets of, as I mentioned, secondary sanctions that we might conceivably impose."
XYgwBPfx4fE,6383,Aaron Friedberg,"And apparently some of this has to do with 2007 as the date at which they will achieve a certain degree of military modernization. And that's what started the discussion. Some military officers in the US saying we have to be prepared for war- 2027, I think you may have said 2007. I'm sorry, 2027. I'm always making these. Yeah, 2027. Yeah, that year seems to be floating around, right? Right. But now you've also got this bidding war where people are trying to say, ""No, it's not 27, it's 25."" And one high ranking US officials said, ""No, it could be this year."" So, there's a little bit of, I don't want to call it hysteria, but this concern is well-founded in my view in the larger sense. But there is a way in which I think our discussion of the Taiwan issue may have become too narrowly focused on some of these military questions. And whether or not Beijing decides to use force against Taiwan is not going to depend solely on their assessment of the ballots and military capabilities so that if tomorrow they feel like they've got just enough missiles to suppress Taiwan's defenses, then they're going to go to war. If they do this or if they come to a moment when they're contemplating whether to do it, their decision is going to depend on an assessment of a whole array of factors of which the military ones are maybe not even the most important."
Z6Ma8xnpUFP,6420,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't mean to be complacent about it, but we should look at the broader picture and the things we can do to deter them by threatening to use or increasing our capacity to use a variety of different instruments. Which in part brings us back to where we started because I had this conversation in Europe with someone who follows China closely. I said, ""What's the most important thing you think we could all do?"" He said, ""Stick with Ukraine, win the war in Ukraine, make Putin's gamble really, really, really not pay off as they see the analogy and the lesson."" So, I was going to ask more broadly as we conclude what to look for over the next months and year, maybe in terms of US actions and other actions around the world that Chinese actions that might tip us off about where things are going. But I suppose Ukraine really matters, right? I think it does, and they're watching it closely. If Western resolve crumbles or if the Western alliance begins to break apart, that's going to make Beijing more confident that it can deal with whatever the consequences of their acting against Taiwan might be. They may be hoping that in the next American presidential election, a candidate will be elected who will be much less supportive of Ukraine and perhaps they'll take some comfort from that."
g9mZuGbOe3p,6548,Aaron Friedberg,"Those people are out. He's put people in all these positions who are loyal to him, dependent on him, and in many cases, whose qualifications to hold the positions that they now hold seem to have more to do with their political loyalty than with their previous experience or their obvious expertise. So, he's put emphasis on control. The other thing, though, that's been going on is- And that 20th party Congress was just a few months ago. Right? Yeah, October 2022. So since as we talked of looking forward at it in our previous conversation and wondered if what you just described happened would happen, and it did happen. Yes, it did, and I think it was predictable. So, a third term as general secretary, he did not identify anyone as a possible successor, which, Chinese leaders have done in the past, which many people think means he intends to rule indefinitely. Because if you have a successor, they can become a kind of focal point for opposition to you if you're perceived to have screwed up, and he's not going to let that happen. So, I think the smart money would bet that we've got him for quite a while. Until his health fails, he's not going to... These guys don't generally retire peacefully, especially if you've thrown as many of your enemies in jail as he has."
BVjPyfBF8Tv,6211,Aaron Friedberg,"They may be hoping that in the next American presidential election, a candidate will be elected who will be much less supportive of Ukraine and perhaps they'll take some comfort from that. So yes, it's important. If we want to persuade them of our resolve and our capacity, our toughness, our willingness to take some pain ourselves, we have to stay the course with Ukraine even if it gets more costly and more dangerous. And I hope we will not only because of deterring China, but obviously because of concerns about what happens in Ukraine. So yeah, that's extremely important. By the way, I think the Chinese preference about Ukraine would be that it would settle into a frozen conflict where the war would not exactly end. There wouldn't be peace. Certainly, Putin wouldn't lose, but the two sides would be locked in an ongoing conflict that would be even more intense than what followed 2014, and we would therefore be even more preoccupied with what was happening in Europe and less able to deal with them and to focus on them. I think that's what they're hoping for. The fact that they're now talking about diplomacy and floating- there's not really a plan, but their ideas for resolving the dispute peacefully, there's nothing to the substance, but the fact that they're moving that piece on the board now I think suggests that they may be willing to get somewhat more involved in trying to move in that direction."
LfU_LrHHtTN,6859,Aaron Friedberg,"So, I think the smart money would bet that we've got him for quite a while. Until his health fails, he's not going to... These guys don't generally retire peacefully, especially if you've thrown as many of your enemies in jail as he has. He's got to stay on the tiger. And I think he intends to, partly because he sees himself as the crucial figure. The environment that Beijing, that Xi Jinping himself faces, has in many respects become more challenging over the last couple of years. And I guess we'll talk about the external part, but internally, there's COVID, COVID lockdowns, increasing dissatisfaction with those lockdowns, a sudden reversal of policy, abandonment of ""Zero COVID,"" letting the disease just sort of rip through the country. We don't know for sure, but it's probably been over a million people who have died of COVID just in the last month or so. So, they made a decision that their attempts to stamp it out were not going to succeed indefinitely, and they were willing to pay the human cost and the cost of some further temporary economic disruption to get through that and to get on with business. But even more important, I think, are the deeper sort of underlying challenges that China faces in trying to continue down the path of economic growth."
Q-dos4YCwtR,6191,Aaron Friedberg,"I mean, did this thing follow just as an unmoored balloon would've moved or didn't it? So, I think we know, or will know the answers to those questions, but I assume in dealing with the CCP, the current regime, assume malign intent and you're usually right. Anyway, so they were pursuing a somewhat kinder, gentler foreign policy for a few months after, well, I guess after the party congress really, right? Yes. And maybe a little before that. And so where do we stand now on that and implications for the future on Taiwan, especially where, I don't know, people who seem to know something are being pretty forward-leaning and saying there really could be a war. I mean, people who are not in the alarmist camp, I would say, and are more professional military and intelligence types. So, I don't know, what's your sense of that? Look, I think overall the direction of their policy, their assumptions about the way the world is evolving, are unchanged. They believe they're headed towards a much more difficult environment. They believe the possibility of conflict is rising. They of course don't hold themselves responsible for that. They see us as being aggressive and provocative and see themselves as having to act defensively in the face of that. None of that has changed."
gF-4l-YXsp7,6198,Aaron Friedberg,"What's happened in China, it's happening over the last 10 years, it's happened more visibly maybe over the last couple of years, is that there is a greater and greater concentration of power in the hands of the party over all other actors in Chinese society, including the state. The party dominates the state, but also all elements of society, including business. And Xi Jinping has been quite explicit about this, that it's necessary to tighten the party's grip on society and on the economy in order to preserve stability and to prevent hostile forces from destabilizing and weakening China, and he's acted on that and continues to act on it, and it's manifest in a variety of ways, one of which is the fact that he is clearly now the maximum leader. Any notion that there was anything resembling a collective leadership among equals is gone. I think it's been gone, really, since he came in. But at the 20th party Congress, he effectively removed from all the high- ranking positions, not that there were any enemies of his, but people who even had alternative sources of power themselves or came from other parts of the system that weren't his gang. Those people are out. He's put people in all these positions who are loyal to him, dependent on him, and in many cases, whose qualifications to hold the positions that they now hold seem to have more to do with their political loyalty than with their previous experience or their obvious expertise."
jUIT5lhu6Aw,6968,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't think anybody in his right mind in the Chinese system is going to do that, certainly under Xi Jinping. So no, I think they had an interest in this trip. They would've been happy to have Blinken coming to Beijing. The visuals of that are favorable from their point of view. So, I don't think they deliberately sabotaged it. But they're committed enough to that intelligence gathering that they weren't willing either to, maybe they canceled it, so to speak, or to pull back the weeks before a summit. That wouldn't have been a crazy thing to do. I don't know, maybe it just has a certain autopilot character to it. They certainly weren't willing to apologize or to say it was a mistake, which they could have. I mean, we did after the U-2, right? I think, didn't we? I think. Eventually, afterwards. Maybe it took a while, right? Eisenhower was caught in a lie because he originally thought the plane had been destroyed and there was no evidence. So, he got up and said it was a weather plane, not knowing the Soviets actually had the pieces of it and knew that it was a spy plane. So yeah, at times they have done things that are provocative on the eve of or during visits by foreign dignitaries."
xY_Tkp0pOMI,2373,Jason Furman,"The three and three-quarters years, that's the part that gets me the most alarmed, honestly. Maybe Musk will stop doing his damage to civil servants and to the infrastructure of government and maybe Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be thwarted in destroying our public health system at all. Those guys might leave, but Trump's not going anywhere for quite a long time. I suppose he might learn a lesson from his exercising all this arbitrary power, but as you say, this is not... I mean, if you want to do the end on the positive note, yes, I don't think anyone has done more to help demonstrate the benefits of freer trade than what Donald Trump has done in the last week. It's much more effective than a thousand points I could make on the benefits of trade. And so maybe people will come through this a little bit more accepting of a certain amount of normalcy, a certain amount of small C conservatism, only wanting to make smaller changes. And a certain appreciation that the system as we had it before was not perfect, but it delivered an awful lot for an awful lot of people. And it might be easier to make it dramatically worse than to make it dramatically better. Yeah, that is a good note to end on and I think an intellectually correct note in my opinion, but it'll be interesting to see whether it has political salience with this administration."
FQWEZN-YMEx,2341,Jason Furman,"That gets you enough votes both to bring legislation to the floor of the Senate regardless of what the majority leader thinks and lets you pass it with a veto-proof majority. Then you're sitting there with all sorts of things going wrong in the economy. And what does Speaker Johnson, or again, the possibility of a discharge position, from Republicans joining Democrats... How do they say it? Do I think this is the likely scenario? No, but if the president completely sticks to his guns and the uncertainty is at the bad end of the spectrum in terms of its consequences, we may see things in our politics that we haven't seen very much before. Everyone in the House is running for reelection in less than two years time. I can't imagine they think this is going to help them. And politics is dynamic, as is economics actually. And if Trump's numbers get knocked down a little bit because the stock market continues to drop some and the economy turns south in certain ways and it's connected to his stubbornness on tariffs and Republican members start to think, ""Oof, I don't want to..."" Before this, I think the degree of stickiness to Trump, of loyalty, to say the least, to Trump on other issues, could start to be corroded a little."
-gGucJBa-K7,2430,Jason Furman,"This really puts the Fed in a bind. It gives them a worse set of choices than they had before. They can accept higher inflation in order to combat unemployment, or they can accept higher unemployment in order to combat inflation. Most likely they're actually going to do a combination of somewhat higher inflation and somewhat higher unemployment. And all of this is a bigger problem now because we went into this with an inflation rate of about 2.8%. And so inflation was already... hadn't come all the way back down to the landing we had wanted. That means the fear that this gets built into expectations built into the economy going forward is much more real than it might otherwise have been. And how quickly, just assume, again, oh, this policy sticks now for a couple of months at least, how quickly do we see the effects, do you think, on inflation and on unemployment or the inflationary side effects and the recessionary side effects, so to speak? Once again, unfortunately don't have enough historical experience to trace out what an economist would call the impulse response function- how the economy responds at every moment in time. My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are."
Hu1vHiFJmJb,2341,Jason Furman,"And then, in terms of the real economy, inflation is part of the real economy, but all in on GDP and stuff, do you think, I mean, could we be in a recession in six months? Is it that too fast? We could, again, anything is really possible here. I think you're going to see weaker growth already in the second quarter numbers that, and you're already seeing some layoffs here and there, some pauses in investment projects. All of that has a ripple through the economy. A big question mark in all of this, as it always is in the US economy, is what happens to our consumers. Our consumers are what kept us out of recession when the Fed raised rates so much in 2022 and 2023. They just kept spending like crazy even though they were super pessimistic when they answered surveys. Right now, they're also quite pessimistic. Interestingly, unlike a couple of years ago, they're pessimistic, not just about the present, but also about the future. And does that lead the American consumer to cut back on their spending? That's a big question mark. And with 70% of the economy, it'll be important to see what happens there. I want to get to the uncertainty factor, which is somewhat different from the more direct effects, I suppose."
MMdxYYfW1Nt,2552,Jason Furman,"And so they would try to figure out how to rule in a way that lets the president decide all executive branch things except monetary policy. That being said, the Supreme Court's a wild card. Donald Trump is a wild card. And I think this episode we've just gone through is a good reminder to care and pay more attention to some of the tail risks. It's not just Trump derangement syndrome to think he might do some of the things that he said he would do. I suppose the Fed would get into the crosshairs-and Trump's crosshairs-in a big way, if the economy slows. And he's always been a low-interest rate guy and he wants the Fed to cut, and he did in the first term, and he'll urge them to do it again. And Powell will say, ""I'm sorry, inflation is now at 3.7% or something, I can't cut."" And that would be the scenario, right? I suppose. Exactly. I think the most likely scenario where he goes after the Fed and- Exactly. We're heading into something where he wants them to do something they're not doing, and he doesn't really care as much about market constraints anymore, and there's been some permissiveness from the courts. So all of those are what could come together. And again, this is just something that is well within the realm of possibility."
62NVXzrU4to,2430,Jason Furman,"My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are. And in terms of inflation, some prices are going up in April, which means when you get the CPI print in May, that'll show you the April numbers. I think you'll see some sort of pop there. And by the way, just as an aside, it does puzzle me that people in the Trump administration, their economic officials are saying it's not going to show up in prices because we're going to know the answer to this question. This is not like an academic study a decade from now is going to try to tease out the effects of this. It'll be clear and they will either be right or they'll be wrong. And I think they're pretty likely to be wrong. And how soon, I guess, will we really see, will there be just a consent? Well, if they're wrong, how soon will we know that in a sense, more certainly that we do just from the theories and the models and I guess the opposite also."
pv03pebwgu5,2413,Jason Furman,"And the main thing driving that borrowing is our budget deficit. So if you wanted to worry about the overall trade deficit, you actually want to look to the underlying macroeconomic drivers. But that, of course is the opposite of what they're doing. Yikes. Okay. So talk me through now what you think the consequences of new current policy would be in terms of inflation, that's gotten a lot of attention, but also jobs and GDP and exports, imports. Ultimately interest rates, we can get to that. And then maybe after that we'll go to, ""Well, what if he does tool it back to something that some of his friends and supporters are urging."" How big an effect do we still face? But what about current policy? Let's just stipulate current policy for the next three months, where's the economy then? So most of the forecasters have increased their forecast for inflation by about a percentage point and a half. So that would take the inflation rate to maybe three and a half percent, possibly four. And most forecasters have lowered their growth rate forecasts by say a point and a half, thinking that we would have a growth rate of maybe half a point this year, eke something forward that's positive. There's a huge amount of uncertainty around both of those, because you can estimate if the cost of an import goes up 20%, how much less of it do you buy."
5yAEkCRmAmc,2415,Jason Furman,"Yeah. This clearly was an answer they came up with and then they came up with a formula to justify that answer. And in fact, a lot of the different senior officials have said they had nothing to do with the formula. So right now no one's really taking credit for the formula. So I don't think this was a math error that drove a policy change. It was a conceptual error. And the conceptual error is that every time the United States has a trade deficit with a country that is evidence that the other country is doing something wrong and hurting us and taking advantage of us. And that is the core idea here and the core thing the president is trying to solve, I don't think he'll solve it, by the way. And just to give an example of this, take Madagascar, we run a trade deficit with Madagascar right now. They sell us vanilla beans. They don't buy very much from us, mostly because they're really poor. We're not going to make America great again by selling more to Madagascar. We've now put a huge tariff on Madagascar. What will that mean? Well, probably won't mean that they buy more of our stuff and make America rich. It means we're going to buy less vanilla beans and have less of that in our country."
boCjTME6tTR,2941,Jason Furman,"And in a funny way, it's hard for him to do that, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, I was picturing what would've been going on in a normal White House over the weekend after the ""Liberation Day"" announcement. And when you saw what happened in markets on Thursday and Friday, what we would've done in the Obama administration, not what would've done, what we did do during the financial crisis-I'm pretty sure it's what the Bush administration did during the financial crisis-is the whole economic team is there in the White House, they're meeting together, chaired by the NEC director. The president would probably come in for some of those meetings, but he wouldn't be there obviously for all of it. And the goal of that entire weekend's of work would be to have an announcement to reassure markets, create a predictable path forward, and the time you would have for that announcement is before the Asian markets opened. You are always aiming to just create certainty and predictability before the first market in Asia opens, I think around 8:00 PM on Sunday Eastern time. And it doesn't seem like that's what happened over the weekend after ""Liberation Day"" in this administration, although obviously I'm not privy to everything they do. Well, the one thing we did see was almost everyone on some different Sunday TV show, I guess, secretary of the treasury, secretary of commerce, the..."
hufdgmLzbJp,2514,Jason Furman,"And he's threatened a 50% tariff on China against its retaliation. So the announcements are all about more tariffs. And by the way, there's other ones he's talked about, like if you buy oil from Russia we'll put a tariff on you, or buy oil from Venezuela. So everything he's talked about is higher tariffs. That being said, maybe he'll do lower tariffs. And that's the whole point is who knows. And do you think this is a big shock, that is to say there are other parts of economic policy, obviously monetary, fiscal, et cetera, tax policy, but does this dwarf whatever's likely to happen in those areas for the next few months or year? Or some of what will happen in those areas is reactive to this obviously, as we've been discussing with the Fed. But you think this is the big news, so to speak, of 2025. There is one piece of news that could be bigger. I still think it's an outside chance, but I've raised the odds that I attach to it, and that would be ending the independence of the Federal Reserve. What would that require? It would require not just replacing the chair, the chair is only one vote out of 12 on the FOMC, a very influential vote. But if you put a crazy person in his chair, they're not going to get 11 other votes for their vision."
LXZ6CFfnq-y,6796,Aaron Friedberg,"And of course, that's always an issue for Taiwan. But then there were all kinds of the usual sorts of domestic issues about employment and domestic policy and so on. And on that score, I guess the DPP took a lot of criticism and the newly elected or incoming president of the DPP got something like 40% of the total vote, whereas the outgoing president, President Tsai had gotten 50% when she ran. So there's a degree of dissatisfaction with what the DPP is doing. People have said that if the two opposing parties had managed to get their act together, and they tried to form a unity ticket, but it fell apart. My understanding is in part because they couldn't decide who was going to be at the top of the ticket. But maybe if they had done that, they would've won. Anyway, they didn't. And yes, with all of those issues, and I should say also with a very concerted and ongoing effort on the part of the PRC to interfere in their election with disinformation, misinformation, propaganda, even with all of that, there was, as far as I'm aware, no challenge, no serious question raised about the validity of the election and about its outcome. So again, there's some sort of civic lessons to learn there because the degree of involvement and engagement on the part of their citizens, but also undoubtedly there are some lessons to be learned about how exactly to handle CCP disinformation efforts."
UCsttmejHgx,6906,Aaron Friedberg,"People made this comparison, I think we did when we talked last year, to the North Korean attack on South Korea in June 1950, and the decision that the Truman administration made to ratchet up defense spending and to solidify NATO and so on. Different, undeniably, and maybe less intense. It was pretty intense, but maybe it was different than the Russian attack on Ukraine, but there was a model there for rallying the American people, and it seems to have passed, unfortunately. Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly, obviously, for things that could... but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents. But the Trump thing is... I mean [inaudible], ""Oh, you don't like Trump, so you're just saying this."" But of course it really isn't just analytically so different that he's going to, presumably, going to be the nominee again. I was thinking about it. Take the Trump, take the Truman example, just a very simple way. Roosevelt in '44, and Truman in '48 all ran against Republicans who defeated the isolationist wing of their party and therefore were more or less..."
DjcTryRLwd1,6739,Aaron Friedberg,"And they both got crushed in general elections, which restored the strength, that you might say, of the more or less bipartisan consensus, which was able to live through Watergate, therefore, and other things. I mean, it's as if we do have Robert Taft as the nominee. From my point of view, it's as if we have Robert Taft as the nominee in '52 or really maybe Joe McCarthy as the nominee in '52, if you want to think about it that way. Which incidentally, he wasn't never thought of at the time, I think, as a real presidential possibility. He had a lot of fervent supporters. But of course, it's a different world we live in, and Trump has been president, so he is a real possibility, obviously. I guess how much does that change the dynamics of everything, where Henry Wallace could not just a third- or fourth-party candidate, but a possible competitor to Truman in the Democratic Party in '48 would've been another analogy, perhaps? I do feel that people underestimate a little bit, we went through all those fights here in the forties and fifties and afterwards. But this is so unusual in a way, but also challenging, therefore, to deal with this, which does mean, just to get back to your basic point, and maybe you could talk a little more about this, we'll probably have to put off all the big talk, the interesting talk about the longer term challenge of China."
eT2nq5QaRZR,6616,Aaron Friedberg,"But what happened in the Taiwanese election? What does it matter? And more broadly, how does China see things in their neighborhood and around the world, in your opinion, compared to maybe a year ago? A year ago, I think we had this conversation in March, you really stressed the degree to which China would like to have a frozen conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that would weaken us, make Russia maybe even more dependent on them going forward. But now other things have happened too. So give us the Taiwan issue and the Chinese point of view in general. Okay, so starting with the Taiwan election last Saturday, as you mentioned, Taiwan had a presidential election. There were three parties, the DPP, which is the incumbent, the KMT or Kuomintang, which is their main opposition, and then a third, a new political party. So it was a three-way race. A couple of things to note about it, just struck in reading the accounts of the election. First of all, something like 70 plus percent of eligible voters voted in their election. You may have seen videos of the process by which the ballots were being counted. No one raised any questions about the validity of the outcome, even though obviously the parties that lost hoped that they would win."
nR3SUoIPXoS,6691,Aaron Friedberg,"And one of the lines of criticism of what the administrations have been doing in Ukraine is that it's arguably taken resources and focus away from Taiwan, which some in the Republican Party in particular say should be our principal concern. So, they're dealing with these three crises or confrontations, and they're also under increasing domestic political pressure. So, I don't envy them. Yeah. And the possibility of Trump, we'll certainly get to this a little later, being elected in 2024 also complicates their life because it means foreign actors have different incentives, Putin to wait things out for this year, allies to be nervous and so forth. But let's get back to that. There's so much to cover. I don't quite know where to begin. But let's begin with Taiwan, which is the least kinetic, I would hope. We say this, and of course we release this conversation tomorrow and God knows what could have happened, but let's hope not. But they just had an election last weekend. The situation there is less dramatic, obviously, than Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas or the Houthis. But what happened in the Taiwanese election? What does it matter? And more broadly, how does China see things in their neighborhood and around the world, in your opinion, compared to maybe a year ago? A year ago, I think we had this conversation in March, you really stressed the degree to which China would like to have a frozen conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that would weaken us, make Russia maybe even more dependent on them going forward."
Do00m4jTYNQ,6834,Aaron Friedberg,"So it's a defeat for the mainland that the DPP won as the least pro-succumbing-to-the-mainland party and quite resistant to it actually. That's kind of their brand. But on the other hand, a defeat that they're going to try to deal with. Not one that's going to make them think, ""Oh gee, I guess we have to give up on those prospects of unification with Taiwan."" Yeah. And people have pointed out that there's now divided government, so I believe the KMT has a majority in the legislative branch. So, there are going to be some constraints on what this new president can do, and undoubtedly the PRC is going to try to work on those and slow down Taiwan's efforts to strengthen itself, in particular. The problem, I think, for China in the long run has been evident for a while, and this is just a reminder. And that is they really have lost any possibility of achieving, as they would put it, reunification in an uncoerced or peaceful way. For a long time, they did entertain the hope that they could do that. They thought maybe the KMT was the vehicle. But Taiwan has changed in the last 20 and 30 years, and more and more Taiwanese people think of themselves as Taiwanese first and not Chinese first."
XDidddDtK9R,6911,Aaron Friedberg,"We're all just sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they're dealing with now. Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you're saying is I just worry also though about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months. I mean, that is to say, what does the world look like in October of 2024? Are we confident Ukraine hangs on and is able to at least stabilize the situation, which itself isn't great in a way, a frozen war without USA? Are we confident there will be USA? Are we confident about what happens in the Middle East? What about the Taiwan situation? So, the degree of just a very short-term instability in the middle of an election year with Trump as the probable nominee and everyone and him saying certain things, weighing in on everything presumably, which then affects the instability. I mean, I think people, we haven't really gone through that either, honestly. And so, in a way, not really, I would say even in 2016 where people didn't think Trump was going to win or 2020. And again, that was all before February 2022 and before October 7, 2023. So yeah, we'll have a lot more to talk about even this year."
8vXx-8RUYcE,6795,Aaron Friedberg,"Maybe that doesn't make a huge difference, but it's part of an ongoing effort that the PRC is making to limit Taiwan's diplomatic space. I mentioned the economic pressure, and they're continuing to put military pressure on Taiwan, both in the longer term, the ongoing military buildup, which is very serious. And every day that goes by, China's capabilities against Taiwan are growing, but also displays of force. People, I think, are waiting to see whether the mainland will respond to the outcome of the election with anything that resembles what they did when former Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan, I guess, in August, 2022. And they may yet do things like that. During the course of the election campaign, I think even while the election was underway, apparently they floated some of these surveillance balloons across Taiwan. There've been suggestions that they will take some further steps like penetrating Taiwan's airspace and overlying the island, this kind of thing. So people are waiting, I think, to see what the PRC will do. I guess my own view is the likelihood in the near term that the mainland is going to start a war with Taiwan is very, very small. And I think that's probably going to be true for at least in the short to medium term. I just don't see this happening immediately."
0Bi0cZaIW4-,6806,Aaron Friedberg,"We went through some of this January 6th. But who knows what happens if he gets in. And that really is going to force everybody to recalibrate their thinking about the United States and about the role that we play. Of course, it's exaggerated, and it's led to some mistaken decisions to have this view as the United States as the indispensable power and so on. On the other hand, we are the poll in the tent that's holding up anything resembling a stable international order, at least among... in the democratic parts of the world, democratic with a small D. And if that's gone, I think we're going to see a lot of chaos. I think we're going to see a lot more conflict even than we've seen. Our allies are going to have to recalibrate and do various things, including potentially acquiring nuclear weapons of their own on the one hand. And on the other, what is that going to do to our opponents? And there's not a simple answer to that. I think there's reason to believe that Putin has been playing for this longer term with the hope that if Trump comes back, the pressure is going to be off him and support for Ukraine is going to be reduced if not eliminated, because I think our European friends would at least try to fill in if we were doing less."
p6f2zFwoyEN,7052,Aaron Friedberg,"He might. But would he be as interested in supporting Taiwan as the current Democratic administration has been? I mean, there's some reason to have doubt about that. If you think about how Trump appears to make these calculations, what's Taiwan done for us? They've stolen our technology, and we should be making these semiconductors. So, the other thing I think from a Chinese perspective is the prospect that deepening divisions within the United States and between the United States and its allies are very much in their interest. I think they are for reasons that maybe we'll talk about next time around, they have significant problems of their own, but they also have still faith in their long-term prospects. And they're convinced that our internal problems and divisions are greater than theirs and are going to prevent us from responding as effectively as we might to what they're intending to do and what they have been doing. So would they rather see Trump elected in 2024 or not? I don't know. In one sense, maybe it doesn't matter to them. We're all just sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they're dealing with now. Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you're saying is I just worry also though about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months."
HNL9k2ohtQ_,6395,Bill Galston,"But I think you would agree with this. You and Elaine, I think put out ""The Politics of Evasion"" in 1989, and you had a big impact, and the whole Clinton New Democratic effort there, which succeeded in '92. But the biggest impact was the fact that Democrats thought they had a very good chance in 1988. Everyone sort of has forgotten this in history because we now think of, from a policy point of view, the Reagan-Bush years, 12 years. Makes perfect sense. They wanted to go to war, why not? But Bush was an underdog, or thought to be at least, in '88. Dukakis was thought to be a reasonable candidate, actually, a moderate governor. And I think the shock of losing that election, don't you think, really helped? This is a line I have taken in public and in private many times, that I was... For my sins, I was Walter Mondale's issues director for two and a half years during his presidential campaign. And I don't think there was anybody in America who was surprised by the outcome of that race. But I'll tell a self-centered story about 1988. Good. It was June of 1988. If memory serves, Dukakis was up on George H.W. Bush by about 17 points in June. Then out of the blue, and I'd been talking about my skepticism privately with Democrats, so out of the blue I get a call from the late sainted David Broder."
__XdlYAPD7P,6943,Bill Galston,"So it's very specific. Let me just ratify your general point, and that is that Kansas is a red state, but it is a red state, I believe, with a democratic governor and it's a red state that indicated very, very forcefully at the ballot box that it was prepared to lean red but not to plunge into a vat of red dye. It said this far but no farther. And if you look at a state like Kansas, the sorts of people that it sends to the Senate, or at least used to send to the Senate, the Doles and the Kassebaums of this world, I think that ethos in Kansas is still there. And so we're going to have to differentiate a little bit more among quote, unquote ""red"" states. Kansas is not Alabama. And this is a [inaudible] of mine which I'll indulge for 30 seconds. I think you agree with it, though, that people who were... The last 10, 20 years, you would've been right about a lot of elections by saying demography is destiny, as you said, geography is destiny, It's the red districts, blue districts, and it's gotten more polarized. And so people like me who said, well, I don't know, that candidate's terrible, didn't matter. That candidate's good. If you were running for the Senate in South Carolina and you were a fine Democrat or Kentucky, didn't make any difference at all."
a10FqsbBZkg,6394,Bill Galston,"Yeah. Well, he can- Which he touts as a pro-life law, which is fine by me, but it's a funny way. He can get away with that, right? He has the best of both- See, in the current context, I think that he can stand on that and defend it and not be hurt too bad. But I'd be very interested to dive deeper into the utterances on the subject of people like Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania or the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, which is a state with more of a libertarian public culture than just about any place else, except maybe Alaska. There are states where gubernatorial contests could very well revolve around this issue, and conceivably in very close races could be determined by it. One more thing on just the states. It was a recent poll, you saw it as well, from Michigan, a reputable pollster, which showed just an unbelievable gender gap. I believe that the Republican was ahead of governor Whitmer by one point among men and losing by 25 points among women. It's almost hard to believe that that could be quite correct, but it is what it is, a real poll, and it ends up with Whitmer winning by 12 or 13, or something like that. And abortion, when asked, then is a big concern to a lot, especially of the Whitmer voters."
InmpAOqryDW,6282,Bill Galston,"You say it's not Mississippi or Alabama. Is it inconceivable these states? People sort of think Ohio... Someone was saying to me just the other day, advanced, at the end of the day it's Ohio, he's going to win. He's like, maybe. On the other hand they do have actual Democratic Senator who actually won a race in 2018. Now it's easier as an incumbent to win. Sherrod Brown is a different candidate than Tim Ryan. There are a million things one could say, but I do feel like the demography has been overdone at this point a little bit. And issues like abortion, a little bit underappreciated. I don't know, do you think that's right? Oh look, Bill- There's a point at which speculation runs out. As a Democrat, I wish Tim Ryan well. He's running a very smart race, and if he can't win a statewide scene, then I think that will tell us one thing about Ohio. But if he can win, that will say something very different and will put wind in the sails of Democrats who've been arguing for a long time that writing off the white working class is not a path to victory. But speaking of demography, you've given me a chance to sail against the wind one more time. Good, good. The conventional wisdom about the..."
Yqr98ER9T6q,6568,Bill Galston,"Everyone can imagine circumstances that might come up, that might affect, if not oneself of course, but one's family members, or it has affected close family members or friends, and if you're a young person, it's more your own decisions, and if you're a mother or grandmother, as you say, or father or grandfather. But I also think people underestimated the importance of the fact that it was a five to four decision. Again, not that most voters are analyzing Supreme Court decisions super closely or whatever, but this was clear... A five four decision. Most of these big decisions are... Roe v. Wade was seven two. A little broader spectrum, you might say, of justices, and it was entirely a court... Well, there of the five were put on the court by Donald Trump in the last four years, so it was sort of not like the court has been moving in this direction for quite a while, and there were some appointees of Obama and some of Bush, who were kind of on board, and this is... You can dislike the decision, or you can say, as people do to other decisions, ""This was an overreach,"" but it would sort of have a certain kind of grudging legitimacy, you might say. Whereas here, it just... If you were already inclined to distrust the court, distrust the way some of these judges got on, distrust then, as you say, the attempt to impose this as an overturn of a 49-year-old precedent by a five four decision with three judges who were appointed in the last four years, I think that just compound..."
70HmoCaqtIT,6297,Bill Galston,"I don't think anybody thought it would be like that. I certainly didn't. I thought there was a chance. Subsequently, some special elections that were thought to be leaning Republican have gone the Democrats' way, including a special election for a Congressional seat in New York, where the Democrat prevailed by two points in a district that was thought to be leaning pretty strongly Republican, and where there was an entirely credible Republican candidate, Marc Molinaro I think his name was. In addition, there's all sorts of evidence from party registration figures since the Dobbs decision overturning Roe was handed down, that women are disproportionately registering, more Democrats than Republicans. The recorded level of Democratic enthusiasm for participating in the midterms is moving up closer to the Republican level of enthusiasm, eroding their advantage. I could go on. I just read one analysis suggesting that the Dobbs decision may be responsible for all or most of the three percentage point increase in the so-called generic ballot for the House of Representatives. There's just a mountain of evidence all pointing in the same direction. In addition, it has done two things for Democratic candidates. A, it has infused them with what Keynes famously called animal spirits, right? It gave them energy, or to vary the metaphor yet again, it put wind in their sails, and in addition, it gave a focus for campaigns that previously lacked a focus."
jDrwVxXOnoE,6253,Bill Galston,"It has mattered. I think it's a big question for this off year election, actually, how much it is, how much it becomes state and district specific. On that note, how much is this part... Does Dobbs and the Republican reaction to it or some Republicans, including Republican legislative attempts, fit into a broader democratic narrative of Republican extremism? I mean, I think that's important in politics. You've made this point many times, that each of these issues is important, but then if they create an overall image, you focused on the Democrats in this point of touch extremism, even if each issue is sort of explainable away, well they didn't actually say, ""Defund the police."" Actually this bill, Biden voted for 100,000 cops and whatever. If it fits into some kind of narrative, it has this sort of extra impact. Do you think that's the case here, or have the Democrats done a good job of making it the case, or just maybe they didn't have to do anything, it just is the case? I think I can say without fear of contradiction that it's not helping the Republican cause, that the party's reaction to the events of January 6th, I think has gone against the interpretation of events that the majority of Americans endorse. And it is adding to a general impression of a party that is willing to go a step or two too far."
i0L_ev5mbmW,6505,Bill Galston,"But I'll tell a self-centered story about 1988. Good. It was June of 1988. If memory serves, Dukakis was up on George H.W. Bush by about 17 points in June. Then out of the blue, and I'd been talking about my skepticism privately with Democrats, so out of the blue I get a call from the late sainted David Broder. He let off, as with his usual Midwestern bluntness, ""Hey, Galston, I hear you're the only Democrat in town who doesn't think this is in the bag for Dukakis."" And I said, ""You heard, right?"" He said, ""Would you tell me why on the record?"" And I did. And I was not a bit surprised when H.W. won the election going away, but for the Democratic party, as a whole, it was a third shock. This sort of plays into my law of threes, that for parties who are entrenched in a bad position, it usually takes three national election losses to convince them that something has gone seriously wrong. That was true for the Democrats. It was true for the Labor Party in the UK. They needed to lose three consecutive elections. Then it was true from the Tories who needed to lose three consecutive elections. So I do think... and back up. This is what the lawyers call an argument against interest."
OvEZL4D9TYr,6913,Bill Galston,"And how much of an effect do you think the extremism of some Republican candidates in primaries, and some of them won their primaries, out of some of the law, the application of some of the laws that triggered in after the decision... Has that played a role also, in making pro-life just seem generically more extreme than perhaps it might otherwise have been? That's hard to judge, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised, and it is frequently the case that parties or factions are judged by the loudest and most extreme expressions of their views. This would not be the first time that's happened by a long shot. It's happened to Democrats over and over again, particularly in recent years, on issues having to do with criminal justice, immigration, schools, et cetera. And now the Republican party is learning what it feels like to be on the wrong side of that dynamic, which they are in this case. Yeah, you're right. I mean, if you're already sort of on the wrong side of public opinion, and then you've got a few people, or more than a few sometimes, on your side taking the extreme version of the wrong side, it does more damage, right? To the party as a whole. And it's also triggered discussion of a parade of horribles."
9npSMQaE6xO,6737,Bill Galston,"It's almost hard to believe that that could be quite correct, but it is what it is, a real poll, and it ends up with Whitmer winning by 12 or 13, or something like that. And abortion, when asked, then is a big concern to a lot, especially of the Whitmer voters. And I'd be curious about thoughts on this while we're... And in the breakouts, I was talking with Ron Brownstein about this, who looked down at the cross tabs and so forth. It was penetrating, it was helping Whitmer a lot among working class white women, not just among college educated. I wonder if you think there's some potential for Democrats to ameliorate the damage that's been done to them among white working class in general, but especially women, perhaps if those women may not be so much on board. The Republican in Michigan has a pretty, I think, no exceptions stance on abortion. There are some women who are willing to accept a no exceptions stance, but not very many. That's hard turf to defend. Look, I think experience has taught both of us that a single state poll is not something you can put in the bank, but if it's confirmed by others, it will be more than suggestive. And I do think... Let me step back."
NnCnapZYkjo,4570,Ray Takeyh,"And speaking of leadership, what about the supreme leader who's, what is he? 86 years old, and- 86 years old, yeah. Assuming he physically survives because there are reports that his life could be targeted, was considered a target, assuming he survives. And there is actually a problem with killing a national leader. It is a legally dubious proposition. This is not Nasrallah. He's a leader of a recognized sovereign government. It's generally not a good idea to commission the assassination of national leaders. That has to be said as a preamble to this conversation. If he survives, he will not be supreme. He may be a leader, but he will not be supreme because his cascade of miscalculations have led Iran into this position. By the way, he will have critics on the left, more importantly, on the right. On the right, there will be those who will say to him, and they did say, in the aftermath of October 7th, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rules of the game are different now. Israel will approach the Middle East differently than it has in the past. And you saw their intervention in the Gaza Strip. Subsequently, obviously Hezbollah. There were voices within the Revolutionary Guards, we know that by their publications that were saying, ""If the Israelis have changed the rules of the game, then we should change the rules of our game."
4PiTUjOBNas,4324,Ray Takeyh,"So, that was one of the options that Israelis have considered. But I'm not sure if they're considering it today, because essentially, they're petitioning the United States to use this aircraft and munitions, which they don't have access to. And just on the military side, generally, I guess before we get to the politics-politics, it does feel like there's some pretty broad, and much broader maybe than people expected, devastation of the Iranian security forces, both externally oriented ones- and maybe internally oriented ones? I think The New York Times estimated that about 11 Iranian generals have already been killed. All the relevant commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, of the regular military, and the entire Quds Force. The building has essentially collapsed. So, how many people have died of that? Who knows. The top leadership has been so decapitated, but although it is capable of regenerating. They have appointed a number of substitutes, number of replacements. One of them was already killed. I think they're increasingly making announcement of two substitutes for every job, in case one guy is killed. So, this has been quite devastating to that military leadership. Again, it's a multi-layered force, so it is capable of regenerating leadership, whether it's going to be of the same caliber, or less so, that depends to be seen in practice."
oiSkfVJnr4G,4737,Ray Takeyh,"So he's in a position where he's a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in history of Britain. But he became a prime minister, came Suez, and he's discredited. Ali Khamenei, if he had died at age 83, he would be remembered as one of the Middle East's greatest revolutionaries. He helped defeat America and Iraq. He helped surround Israel with rings of fire. He brought the nuclear program to a point where it was elaborate and on the cusp of detonation. He had consolidated the regime and more importantly, consolidated its revolutionary values. Today, that obituary cannot be redeemed. Today, there's a big footnote in there saying, ""But..."" So his authority is going to diminish, and the regime will have to, assuming it survives, recalibrate the elite structure. In Western lexicon, the civil-military relations, the civil-military balance of power is likely to have tilted toward the military and whatever's left of it. Interesting. I mean, it is kind of amazing. I want to ask you in a minute whether that would make it more radical or less, but I also want to say, I mean, I guess it's easy to say these things after the fact."
QD8GNxGL2yW,4670,Ray Takeyh,"I mean- The events of past week could not have happened if the events in Lebanon had not happened. Yeah. Say a word about that. That's the word I think. Well, it's- It's one of the deterrents was this ring of circle around Israel, right? That could cause so much damage. The idea that Hezbollah missile force could destroy Haifa. The idea that given the geographic proximity, Hezbollah's vast arsenal of projectiles didn't have to travel far. And essentially it had the entire Israeli society as a hostage. Once that front was disabled, and it was disabled with imagination and alacrity, once something happened that nobody thought would happen, Nasrallah was buried in his bunker. Because previously the argument was however bad Nasrallah is, and you're hearing this argument about Khamenei, however bad Nasrallah is, he kept Hezbollah intact and he can be counted on to be pragmatic because he has learned lessons of 2006 about messing with Israel, and even when he was having rings of fire during the Hamas crisis, he wasn't fully intervening. And that dispersed Hezbollah into various militias will be more of a security problem for Israel than a cohesive Hezbollah by a leader that has experience dealing with the state of Israel. Once the Israelis- This is an argument made by some in Israel and some in the West, right?"
5tnqZK7QL7M,4315,Ray Takeyh,"Still it's pretty... Better to go out of office with... if he's demolished thoroughly or at least in a major way, the Iranian nuclear program. Maybe lead to even the fall of the government there, the regime, then to go on right after October 7th. So you got to say... I mean, I'm not saying that's whatever his motive, I think he's always cared about Iran a huge amount. Yes, that's right. That's right. It just, as a kind of novelistic thing almost it's kind of amazing. Amazing. Yes, he stands as one of the most consequential Israeli leaders, but I'm not sure if that helps him politically three months down line. No. That's another... Because the nature of Israeli politics, such divisions in that, and Bibi is a divisive person within the Israeli body politic. Very much. What do you think? So it sounds like you think some chance of the regime fracturing. I mean, there's some who are very worried about that in the sense of it could end up worse for us, worse for our allies in the region. There's some who say, look, whatever might be chaotic, it might be unpleasant, the new leaders might be military junta or something, but very hard to see how it's more dangerous, and at least you buying... Will take them a while to get things back together anyway."
6n78dcShuyX,4315,Ray Takeyh,"And by the time, if they got there, the Iranians could easily have said, ""The Zionists have infiltrated it so we've got to do more investigation."" If they had taken this deal three weeks ago, we wouldn't be in this position. It's amazing how much I always like to talk about the contingency of history and dislike people who think everything is deterministic, give deterministic accounts. But I've got to say the Middle East, which generally seems to foil that notion of determinism, I mean, the last two years is really unbelievable. If it were a novel, you wouldn't believe it. October 7th, the greatest failure in Israeli intelligence, certainly since '73, basically. Netanyahu utterly discredited, really. I mean, how could this happen on his watch? The stain that he could ever overcome in his career, the whole society, I mean horrified and not- The ongoing hostage crisis. Then the hostage crisis. Two years before that, you had the demonstrations against Netanyahu, clearly representing a majority of the country, or at least very much a large part of the country. And then the war in Gaza, which is very difficult for Israel and a lot of domestic criticism. Are we really doing too much? Are we really accomplishing what we need? Can you really get Hamas out? That one, that one looks more like a classic Middle Eastern, endless kind of slogging along, sort of mowing the grass every now and then but not really solving the problem."
qp6-DI8Os97,4392,Ray Takeyh,"They would be more of a participant in trying to dictate oil prices, like the Shah did. It would be a nationalistic... It would be animated by Persian nationalism. Interesting. Now, the Shah, people always talk about his imperial grandeur. He actually didn't care much about the Arab East, about Syria. He mucked around a little bit in Lebanese politics, but he couldn't understand it, nobody can understand it. He obviously had a very good relationship with Israel, with America. By the way, it wasn't just America. By the end of his rule, he had a good relationship with all the leading powers. China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and all the leading regional powers, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. It was in Egypt in exile that he died. He was very cagey in the international scene, not so much in the domestic scene. So I think his successors will approach politics in that manner, international politics, and of course the successors of the Islamic Republic will be very much preoccupied with the mission of national reconstitution after damage that this revolution has done however many years is still in existence. The revolution has been profoundly damaging to the country. It's been damaging, not in terms of international program sanctions and military intervention. The country has water shortage problems."
VksQNzNpJm7,4241,Ray Takeyh,"And that's a real experience. And so, the society as large, which I think also show classes at this point, I can say, with some confidence, are opposed to the Islamic Republic. That doesn't mean they're energized to come to the streets. In a referendum, the Islamic Republic will lose. Now, that's different than being overthrown. So, all the social classes that are essentially aggrieved at the leadership, those grievances are not deepened. And even before this attack, the Iranian economy was a mess. And you have seen all corruption, and inflation, and currency devaluation. They couldn't keep the lights on and heat in the schools and offices. They had to close offices and schools in order to provide enough heating and enough electricity for people's homes. So, it's like America during the pandemic. Schools were on two days here, off one week, two days here. And they would have a list of provinces where schools are open, list of provinces where schools are closed. And so, they were operating on a pandemic mode, but without the connectivity at home that the American people had. Not everybody, by and large. So, this is a huge problem for the regime. And don't you think, I mean, just feels from the outside that you've been told over and over this is our great enemy."
z0efU9xIra3,4430,Ray Takeyh,"Well, those voices are going to come back in the deliberations of the state and say, ""If we had the bomb, we wouldn't be getting bombed."" And the dangerous aspect of this is that the Iranian nuclear program, whatever is left of it, is likely to be a clandestine one now. The Islamic Republic will probably no longer try to reconstitute a large civilian nuclear program, big plants in Natanz and so forth. It will try to have a surreptitious one with a purpose of detonation with alacrity. That's the argument that they got to be making. Now, that argument has to be made in the context where their intelligence services are penetrated, their scientific establishment is beset, their Atomic Energy Organization building is destroyed, and there's a possibility of intervention given that air defenses have not been constituted. But that's the argument that he will hear from the right. From the left, his misjudgments would be viewed as different. And from the population, his misjudgments would be different. They would be criticizing him for his ruinous policies that has essentially destroyed this country. So he's in a position where he's a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in history of Britain."
3reWJ-O7pM4,5033,Ray Takeyh,"It could go very dangerously. He could finally concede that we're going to build a nuclear weapon, we're going to do whatever we have to do. And also we are going to see, once the population takes account of this, right now the people are leaving their homes from the cities, they're leaving their home from Tehran, once they come back and recalibrate their lives and take accountancy of all this, how they will react to the next regime outrage. And there's always another regime outrage. So that the notion of how this will sort out for the Iranian politics is a post-crisis situation, is a post-crisis development, that's when you see it. But we're still very much in middle of a crisis, or at the beginning of a crisis or a beginning of the beginning of crisis, I don't know where we are. But that's kind of what you look for to see what kind of a regime can actually limp out of this, if any. And there's another online possibility of a simple military coup by the Revolutionary Guards against the civilian leadership. I don't see that happening because they're very much intertwined. They require religious sanction for their violence. That's just the way... They're revolutionaries. The Soviets kept talking about Lenin and all that, Karl Marx and Engel and all that nonsense because they may not have understood it, but they needed those foundational text to justify their misrule."
HLbRAST5lx5,17768,Anne Applebaum,"They manipulate elections, they manipulate the media, and he is essentially the oligarch. Ivanishvili is essentially pro-Russian. And so via him, the Russians have sought to control what goes on in Georgia. And Georgia, for example, has been a state through which a lot of this sanctions-breaking trade has flowed. It's one of the states. And actually the Georgia model, I think is what Putin had hoped to achieve in Ukraine, was to have essentially a pro-Russian oligarch in charge of the country. That's what Yanukovych was. If you can remember back in 2014, he was the president at the time of the Maidan Revolution. And that was their idea, that they would control it via these proxy figures. And they have successfully done that in Georgia, even though some enormous majority of Georgians want the Russians out and they don't want Russian influence in their country. But, through again, manipulation control and the use of money in politics, they've managed to buy a lot of people off. But, you're right. There are now front lines everywhere, inside Georgia, inside Ukraine, but also inside most European countries. Again, the AFD, this is the German far right party, is clearly a pro-Russian party. It's funded in different ways by the Russians and helped in different ways by the Russians. And so, that's another front in this conflict inside German politics."
Zaomm3sLBzQ,17375,Anne Applebaum,"That's what they want, and that's what they're hoping he will do. And again, I don't want to be conspiratorial about how much power they have. They don't run US elections, but they will try to influence the outcome however they can, because they think he will weaken the country ultimately. And, by the way, from what we know, the Chinese are only just beginning to experiment in this world. From what we know the Chinese agree. So, he's the candidate of the authoritarian world, not because he'll make America stronger, but ultimately because they think he'll make America weaker. No. That's so important. And again, even if Russia and China aren't very effective in their interventions and their meddling, and people don't like to think about this in America, but it turns out there's a lot of domestic support for that. Even- Huge. It's not just- Oh, no. No. No. And that's actually how they operate. They operate in conjunction with domestic actors, some of whom use very similar authoritarian language, who also talk about the weakness and decline and degeneracy of democracy. And the cleanliness and stability of dictatorship. You can hear that in the American political debate. And that's not necessarily Russian influence, that's Americans talking like Russians. I think some of it is also influencing them, even the Christian nationalism stuff and all that."
lHvGAtOkDe3,19163,Anne Applebaum,"But Ukraine has recovered from the very low point of three or so months ago when they didn't have the prospects of war aid and they were really beginning to lose ground. So I would say on the ground, that's where we are. I suppose for all these reasons, including the new uses of technology or the new technologies, it's a little unpredictable actually, if things might break in one direction or another, but I guess, am I right that the safer prediction or assumption is not huge changes in the balance of power or balance of forces on the ground over the next several months? So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian."
yowzw3bW8RY,18308,Anne Applebaum,"The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian. The people living on it are put in concentration camps. I mean, there's a horrific story that came out in the FT, in the Financial Times in the last few days, describing how the Russian plan to kidnap Ukrainian children, bring them to Russia, Russify them and put them up for adoption, was actually created before the war. And the FT actually found advertisements, I mean essentially offering Ukrainian children up for adoption inside Russia. So they will lose their children, they will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life. They'll probably lose their businesses because Russia nationalizes whatever businesses it finds in occupied territory. So for them, an occupation is the imposition of a totalitarian regime, and they can't live there, it will be the end. So they will keep fighting. And for Russia, it remains a war of choice. I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have."
xu1TkQRBJCS,17623,Anne Applebaum,"But, there's no one who does it with so extremist- Also, there's nobody as incoherent as Trump. A number of my colleagues have been focused on a speech he gave a few days ago in which he talked about sharks. Are you familiar with the shark speech? He made a speech in which there was a whole long section about sharks and electricity in the water. And something about MIT and would you rather die from electrocution, or from a... It was complete gibberish. On and on. And on and on. I can't think of anybody in the western world, in the democratic world who talks in that completely incoherent ranting and rambling way. And that's not even the dangerous stuff that he does. But, I think it helps him in a weird way. It's like he's and interesting and amusing- He can seem to be goofy and maybe too goofy to be president, one might say. But, others will say, ""Well, but he thought... he still knows what he's doing. He's a business guy."" But, it makes him seem less dangerous, less threatening. I don't actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all this stuff. I'm not saying he's doing this purposely and it's a brilliant four-dimensional chess thing, but it sort of conceals the true, as you say, the really sustained and pretty systematic threat to the rule of law, the institutions, the norms that he's perfectly happy to carry out and pretty conscious that he's carrying out."
-3RKR162X62,17505,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, and of course the big wild card here is Trump. We don't really know what he would do if he won. He's given lots of pretty negative hints, and the Russians may be waiting for him to win or hoping he'll win. And presumably they're going to try and help him win in various ways in order to... And maybe they think then they can get some kind of better deal. I don't know, but that's what I assume. No, that's a huge one, we'll come back to that in a minute. But so when you dig into any of these issues, whether it's Russia, Ukraine, Europe, which we'll get to in a second too, or autocracy around the world, Trump is kind of a central figure. But bracketing that for Trump for a second, am I right to think that all and all the sort of, let's call it diplomatic/political situation in Europe, and I guess now here in a way, after the package has gone through, isn't as bad as one might have feared a year ago in terms of for Ukraine, that we could all complain about different things European countries aren't doing and hesitations and stuff. But at the end of the day, most of the countries are more solid maybe than we might've thought they would be two years ago."

Right? He's pretty conscious. And a really telling thing was said to me recently by a Russian journalist I know who's now in exile, who said to me that in the Kremlin ... And this will take a minute to explain, okay? In the Kremlin, they talk about Trump as the American Gorbachev, by which they don't mean leader of the free democracy and blah. Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore."
uEE9vO9KSj7,17648,Anne Applebaum,"Secondly, he's guessing that there's a slightly different voting process. Votes are counted differently in national elections, which doesn't favor her as much. And thirdly, even if he's wrong and she wins and her party is the largest party, which again wouldn't be a majority, they'd still need to be in a coalition and so on, he's the president for the next three years. And in France, the president controls foreign and defense policy and is perfectly capable of making the prime minister's life miserable. I mean, he can make it very difficult for her to do anything, even if she wins. It was a gamble, but it was a more controlled gamble than it looks. I think psychologically, the effects, don't you think of a Le Pen party governing even only in domestic policy and not all of domestic policy in France would be a pretty... It's France, that would be a pretty big deal. I mean, it would... It would be a big deal. So that people understand. I mean, her party, it was originally her father's party and it does kind of ideologically descend from Vichy, and it was historically an anti-liberal, essentially an anti-democratic party. So there is a normal center in France, or usually there is, it's kind of in bad shape right now. But the far right was against the Republic."
KLf8JnGrB86,18115,Anne Applebaum,"And the cleanliness and stability of dictatorship. You can hear that in the American political debate. And that's not necessarily Russian influence, that's Americans talking like Russians. I think some of it is also influencing them, even the Christian nationalism stuff and all that. I wonder if Putin... He didn't need us to teach him about that given Russian history and European history and history in general. But, the degree to which you can appropriate these religious traditions and symbols and hijack it, or distort it as a supporting populist authoritarian nationalism. I don't know. No. No. This was a kind of co-invention. The American far-right and Putin together invented this idea of some kind of pure white Christian state. In the case of Russia, to be clear, it's absurd. It's not a white, Christian country, it's actually a multinational state. It's some very large percentage, maybe as high as 10 or 12%, Muslim. It's very high divorce rate. Nobody goes to church. Nobody's read the Bible. It's very much not a Christian state. And yet Putin uses this language, both somewhat for internal reasons, but also for external reasons to appeal to the American far right, to appeal to some dictatorships in Africa and elsewhere, also who use this kind of language of traditionalism or traditional culture as a way of dividing the public and fending off people who want to talk about transparency in the rule of law."
8q1tllVEmhH,18921,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have. And so there could come a point when he doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, there's another additional piece of this, which is this war is over when the Russians leave, and it doesn't matter why they leave, they can leave because they lost a battle. They can leave because they are tired. They can leave for economic reasons. And one of the things that's actually happening as we're speaking is that the G7 is meeting, and at the G7, there are going to be a number of things announced. Some have already been leaked, that will increase pressure on Russia. So there will be money that was Russian assets that were frozen at the beginning of the war. The interest from those assets is going to be used essentially to give $50 billion to Ukraine. Also, there's new sanctions on not just Russian companies, but companies that are enabling Russian companies to get around sanctions, especially concerning the rebuilding of their military industrial complex."
KQJjgQjjgBO,12404,John Bolton,"Secretary of Defense and we respect, I think, have intervened at times in the Dick Cheney and Bob Gates and military promotions a bit to change the panel some to reward some new thinking or whatever, but it feels like Hegseth and his team want to go way beyond that. On the other end, there's also been a lot of disarray. So just give me your sense of DOD. Well, I think there is a lot of concern on the military side and the civilian side. I think that's right. I think Hegseth's performance has been so far below expectations that despite some initial moves like removing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and like taking pictures off the walls and things like that of former secretaries of defense, which is just silly and I think regarded as silly, there hasn't been as much disruption as there might've been. Now, there are things that are coming that are not good. I don't think the military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, which coincidentally is the anniversary of the formation of the Army is a good idea. It didn't happen in the first term, although Trump talked about it a lot, and I think that was a good thing for the country. It will not be a good thing to have this parade."
WT5vWhe-XEr,12252,John Bolton,"That's right, because of the Ukraine stuff, he was involved in trying to hold up that money. And then Miller, two extremely powerful White House aides, don't you think? And really very much in sync with each other, very much in a pretty radical view, I think we can say of executive power and what they want to do to the government and very much also not friendly to people with backgrounds that aren't... Have any Romney connection or God forbid, McCain connection or as you say, and also any kind of, I want to raise a few questions about whether we should go ahead with this. Is that your sense, that both Vought and Miller are not... But they're both able people, right? Yeah, they are. And Russ in particular, he spent four years thinking about what he wanted to do and is one of the... As did Steve Miller. And I think they are the shock and awe. People look at DOGE as the shock and awe, but they really are the shock and awe. And in the case of what OMB has done, while I disagree with a lot of it, the combination of DOGE and OMB, there are some places that only shock and awe might work. Some aspects of the government... Look, Ronald Reagan wanted to abolish the Department of Education and as we know, he didn't make it, notwithstanding great people that he had at the education department, including people like Bill Bennett and you."
KST_0xe4Vas,13323,John Bolton,"Well, I think we will have crises because I think some of them are just incapable of showing good sense. Again, this fellow who's the acting US attorney in the district has been sending letters to medical journals, questioning what they're writing about the various diseases. The argument being this could be fraud or corruption of some kind. This isn't going to go very far. Trump's executive orders against the law firms where they have been challenged, where law firms haven't given in, have uniformly been struck down. And I think we'll see whether a number of the other executive orders he's trying to float don't find the same fate. Again, it looks like Trump is succeeding in a wide variety of areas. The litigation is slow to catch up because that's the way the courts operate, but I think it's justice itself that's going to find it harder and harder to do the kinds of things Trump pushed his lawyers in private practice to do. And you think the administration ultimately more or less yields to these court decisions? Well, if they don't, then we will have a constitutional crisis. There's no doubt about it. I think the courts have been pretty restrained, frankly, in the way they've approached this. There are plenty of places where you could see contempt citations being administered, but the courts are building a record because they know every time they do it, it will be appealed."
GhOGV7z8m8d,11682,John Bolton,"You said in the conversation, I'll put it this way. In November, you thought that they'd be surprised when the attorneys in the Justice Department said, ""Well, we can't really do that. It's not going to work very well. We can't argue this case."" It feels to me like the Attorney General so far and a couple of her top deputies have been sort of running... Not being deterred by advice they might be getting from very senior people in the Justice Department. And Hegseth has got it and fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other general officers. And just curious what you think about those two departments. Well, I think in Justice, your description is accurate. And I think a number of very senior lawyers, particularly in the Civil Division, which I used to head, have resigned rather than carry out some of the Attorney General's ideas. I think there's going to be mass resignations in the Civil Rights Division given what we're hearing there. So they have been able to get their way in the first three and a half months pretty much. There has not been as much pushback as I expected. But I would say this: There hadn't been that much litigation in the Supreme Court and if John Sauer, the Solicitor General, wants to come out of this administration with his legal reputation intact, he's not going to run roughshod through the Solicitor General's Office."
wx8hS3Bk5wo,12367,John Bolton,"So Vought and Miller are very powerful. Is your general sense, again, as you've talked to a lot of people who are in there and very close to it, people on the Hill, I want to get back to that in a minute. A sense that they are powerful also in terms of compared to the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, traditionally very powerful figures in a cabinet. Is that your sense this time around? I think that we'll have to see now as Elon Musk's influence fades, and I don't think he's going to be doing a day or two a week at the White House. I think when somebody goes, they go, they may come back once a month or something, and I think that means the DOGE operation, to the extent it still exists hidden somewhere in the executive office of the president will also see its influence diminish. But that may be an opening for Russ Vought, that he will take over that job. But overall, I think more and more decisions will be made in the White House and fewer decisions in the cabinet in the second Trump term than in recent presidencies. I think that's the clear message going ahead. Because I think people will be afraid to do something that might front run Trump and make a decision that he doesn't want to make."
FMt3iqiiMgy,11914,John Bolton,"The president's going to make the final decision on matters that presidents make decisions on, Trump makes more decisions on more trivial things than any other president I've worked for, but that's what he likes to do, go look at the drapes at the Kennedy Center again, because he's chairman of the board. So, the decisions are his, but you hope in a well- functioning government for well-informed decisions, having the facts available on which to base decisions that are inherently judgments, where you're rarely going to have facts all lined up one way or the other, where competing options should be considered. Looking at which may be better, what tweak can you make that will make a presidential idea better? But I don't think Trump wants that, I think he wants pretty much what he said to me, and Mike Pompeo, about two months into my holding the national Security advisor job. We were in Brussels at the NATO summit, trying to persuade Trump not to withdraw from NATO in the spring of 2018, and getting a little frustrated, Trump turned to Pompeo and said, ""I knew I should have made Keith Kellogg national security advisor, he only gives me his opinion when I ask for it."" So, I think Mike Waltz may have made my mistake, and done what a national security advisor does, give advice that Trump didn't want to hear."
7eYrXoBBIB0,12266,John Bolton,"You think the judges are signaling almost, or certainly are behaving in ways that show a certain suspicion about the argument some of the government attorneys are making in a way that wouldn't have been the case in the past? And some of the factual determinations that they're purporting to make. They're stretching arguments beyond credibility, and I do think they're playing fast and loose. Trump himself has said recently, of course, he's going to obey Supreme Court orders. He's trying to cover himself. But he's also clearly had an influence. People are afraid to look reasonable as the United States. Remember, this is not Donald Trump's law firm. It's the United States who their client is. They're afraid to behave the way they normally would. I think we're coming... I hope we're coming to the limit of how far you can play fast and loose with the courts. Yeah, I was going to ask about that. Do you think the Trump administration will learn that lesson and sort of recalibrate a bit or will they try to plunge ahead and we'll get various showdowns and mini crises and not so mini crises? Well, I think we will have crises because I think some of them are just incapable of showing good sense. Again, this fellow who's the acting US attorney in the district has been sending letters to medical journals, questioning what they're writing about the various diseases."
MN5sckgYEDL,13918,John Bolton,"I just hope it's not as bad as it looks right now, and I hope we are able to repair it when Trump is gone. But this is purely gratuitous. It is a completely self-inflicted wound. That's really eloquent and powerful and a little chilling, honestly. I mean, I hope we can repair it also, but it's also how much damage he's done at 100 and whatever we're now at, 10 days or something, less than that, I guess. With 1,300 days or something left, I mean, one assumes that this was the shock and awe period and there's some version almost to the mean or some checking or some rethinking or some mugged-by-reality moments here where he comes back but can also spiral a little out of control, right? And that's what I guess alarms me the most. You just don't know how much strain... We're putting a lot of strain on allies and structures and arrangements that one hopes can... They've been around a long time, they can hold up some, but can they hold up throughout? That's the question, I suppose. Well, it is, and we're not acting alone here. If you're in Beijing looking at this, you're sitting around saying, ""How are we going to take advantage of what Trump is doing on Taiwan, on the South China Sea, on a range of other issues?"" And other rogue states like North Korea are thinking the same, which is why how Trump handles the Iranian nuclear weapons program could be so important."
HbPPLQwXOXg,12966,John Bolton,"I think if Steve Feinberg could clean up defense department procurement, you could speed up the delivery of weapons systems. You could save billions of dollars, all of which you could then plow back into the defense budget and there's an enormous amount of work to do. John Lehman who was Reagan's secretary of the Navy, said some years ago, ""The way to solve the procurement problem at DOD is take all the armed procurement regulations, take all the board of contract appeals decisions, take all the court cases, put them in a big pile in the Pentagon parking lot and burn them."" And I think that's basically about right. So if Feinberg can do that, if he can help make the personnel selection process more efficient in the military, if the service secretaries really do their jobs in an efficient way, if they bring some of what they've learned in business to help make the services more effective, that could all be good and let Hegseth do pushups in the morning with the troops and testify on Congress and things like that. There's a lot to do over there and there may yet be a chance it can happen. Where I think the biggest failing is occurring, and it just happened this week, is in the White House where the defense budget, it looked to be over a trillion dollars request for the next fiscal year, but as Roger Wicker from Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee pointed out it included 150 billion that he had added to Biden's budget just in the past few months."
l7J6j2pgUJj,12199,John Bolton,"I give him credit, he took responsibility for it, which is a rare thing in a Trump administration, where it's always somebody else's fault. And from the best we can see, Waltz was harassed by people who charitably could be called crazy for not being sufficiently loyal to Trump. He found four or five of his senior directors on the NSC fired for not being loyal, people he had personally hired, and Alex Wong came under attack in the same way, and ultimately Waltz himself did. This goes to this question of what exactly is the kind of opinion you should have around a president, certainly in the national security space? I am not arguing that a presidency has to have all opinions, all philosophies, all ideologies represented, I'm not arguing that Elizabeth Warren should have a major place in national security affairs. But I'm saying within the Republican universe-at least, we used to have a universe-there are divergent views, people understand that, they also understand the president makes the final decision, and that unless it's something you can't stomach, in which case you resign, you carry out the president's decision. He got elected, as Jim Baker always used to say, ""He's the guy who got elected, and that's it."" But it doesn't mean you have uniformity of opinion. Even if you want to do X, for example, make Greenland more secure from the perspective of US national security, there are lots of ways to do that."
