fU7wicpHdEo,2756,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And that population continues to go through the education every single year without having any access to a path to permanent legal status. So they're here, and some administrations are, so to speak, nicer to them than Trump threatens to be. I suppose the question is, will Trump find that ultimately in his political interest to kind of go after people who are graduating from high school and applying to college or working in an undocumented way in building trades or hospitality or something like that, or leave that alone and focus more of the ones who have caused more of a ruckus, more politically been the object of a ruckus maybe politically, the last year or two or three, who are the more recent undocumented arrivals? Yes. So ironically, it's actually going to be very hard for them to focus on the more recent arrivals, because the overwhelming majority of the more recent arrivals are already in the process of being ordered potentially deported. There are 3.7 million cases currently pending in immigration court. These are people who already have been arrested, have already been placed into a deportation process, and that is the vast majority of recent arrivals."
ziIbob_y6Sh,2703,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Actually, yes, a lot of people who get arrested by ICE or border patrol and put into removal proceedings, then eventually just get released. If they have no criminal record, they get released, go back to living their lives and attend court for however long that process is. When the court proceeding is over, if they lose, then they get deported. And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head. Based on the Trump administration, if they just get more aggressive on raids or whatever we're supposed to call them, and the targeted actions and if they have the good enough information to know where to target actions and stuff, which maybe they do, I don't know, I mean, what would the plausible number of people... What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people?"
Rfh2zucR_LG,2674,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status. That's something a lot of people had not heard much about and suddenly became a thing, TPS. Trump could make it harder for some of those people to stay in the country and not extend their status or curtail their status, perhaps. How does that work? Explain maybe for a second. There are quite a few people on temporary protected status in the country. That's right. And I think this is a good point to emphasize that the biggest immediate changes Trump can make on day one or within the first few months is to legal immigration and people who have some form of temporary legal status in the United States. So, for people who have temporary legal status, we estimate there's around 2 million people who currently are in the United States with some form of temporary executive-led legal status. Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole."
OTU2Ixw7gBO,2792,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole. All of those are statuses that can be revoked by the incoming administration. There are different processes that they have to go go through. Parole could theoretically be revoked en masse on day one. DACA, because it's tied up in litigation right now, we cannot rapidly get rid of. There's a whole bunch of legal procedures they'd have to go through, but nevertheless, we expect him to try. And with TPS, the law does provide some minimum time periods before it can be terminated, and it's unclear if he would terminate it for everybody. The single biggest population of people with temporary protective status right now is Venezuelans about 600,000 Venezuelans. Just be clear, these are people for whom there would be a danger of being sent back to their country and that's why they have this temporary status, right? Yeah. So temporary protected status is for people... It's a status that the Department of Homeland Security can grant to any country or even subset of a country where sending those people back would be a problem because of armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other serious issue that would make it dangerous to send them back."
irOl3U6AhWN,2724,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people? Hundreds of thousands of people? Tens of thousands for sure, because even the Biden administration has deported tens of thousands of people with criminal records. The previous administration deported every single year. Now, of course, when we say criminal records, I want to emphasize the number one most common offense is traffic offenses of a prior record. The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry. And these are people then who could be rapidly deported. So if you have an immigration offense on your record, that means you've been deported at least once and you can be deported very quickly. But part of the reason that that is true is because ICE's primary way of finding people is through fingerprint checks run by local law enforcement. ICE generally, and this is the history of immigration enforcement, has not in the last few decades, really since Congress 40 years ago told the agency to focus on people with criminal records, has used law enforcement connections as their main way of identifying new targets."
UAp-COuneHe,6810,Larry Summers,"I mean one way to think about it, maybe we had the oil shock in '73 basically, and then Nixon at the same time, considerable political instability leading to the resignation of actually Agnew, separate reasons in a way. Agnew then of course Nixon in '74, but that was about a year. I think what everyone thinks of their administrations-Ford and Carter tried to restore a certain kind of normalcy, you might say, to our politics and did to a reasonable degree. Obviously the economics of the rest of the seventies remained choppy to say the least. And it ultimately took whatever it took with Volcker and all this. But one thing that's really striking, leave aside post 2028 and how much of the damage remains, and I think that's a real concern. But also Donald Trump or Donald Trump only if he's in good health, if not JD Vance, will be president for the next three and three-quarter years. So it's not as if... you don't have that sort of... I mean that was a one-year shock in a certain way in '73, '74 here. Here, it's not only self-administered, which is worse presumably, but also that's where I guess I get also so worried."
KK-IQQ8Vh2b,6880,Larry Summers,"And they have the virtue that they are collective, they have the virtue that participation in them is largely anonymous. People all sell and nobody quite knows who it is exactly who is selling. And they have the virtue that they're always open, and so they're sending signals in very rapid response to events. And all of that makes them a powerful force. But I think they're more effective with respect to some issues than with respect to other issues, and I don't think they are sufficient. Something I have learned over time from my own participation in public debates and watching others is that interventions are most effective when they're unexpected. So the impact of Nancy Pelosi shouting from the rooftops or The New Republic and Nation magazines being deeply concerned about civil liberties is much less than voices like yours or voices of Republican senators or business leaders or the kinds of people who President Trump has traditionally been very respectful of. Yeah, it may be that we'll look back on Liberation Day as a tipping point in this direction, in a good way, and that people stop being able to tell themselves it'll be like the first term, he'll be constrained by reasonably responsible advisors and national security policy and to some degree an economic policy."
Znzv45PfcIr,8365,Larry Summers,"That's a really a long time. A hundred days is one-fifteenth, I haven't done the math precisely of an administration's longevity. And if we're at this level of instability and uncertainty at one- fifteenth, could get better, but it could also just at least stay as bad or could get worse. If JD Vance were ever to ascend to the presidency. It is hard to imagine him saying that our long national nightmare is over as he ascended, and that is a very substantial difference. Richard Nixon, for all his many faults, knew the difference between right and wrong well enough to do his best to obscure all the wrong that he was doing. Donald Trump glories in the wrong that he's doing and wants it to be as public as possible so as to deter, intimidate, and cast a shadow over potential opposition. That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that."
CdcAJHdIEqJ,7490,Larry Summers,"The proposals that he announced on ""Liberation Day"" took 3% to 28%. So it was a tenfold increase. It was 20 times larger almost than what he had done during his first term. There are differences in view about how to interpret precisely where we are or where things might go, but I know of no thoughtful observer who thinks the number's likely to fall below, well, something in the 12 to 15 range. So we are looking at an increment to tariffs five to 10 times conservatively as that which he applied during his first term. So it's a mistake to think of this as a respite from anything other than insanity. From the perspective of what people expected even on election day, on knowing that Donald Trump had been elected, what today is regarded as an optimistic scenario is a high tariff scenario. So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place. Second thing I would say is... There's a saying that it takes 30 years to grow a forest and 30 minutes to burn it down."
ej-bQ8f80YM,6883,Larry Summers,"You and I, Bill, are used to the idea that going to visit certain countries, prudent people carry burner phones so that their phone will not be downloaded with its content. It is now very common practice for visitors from our Five Eyes allies, not NATO, our closest intelligence sharing allies. People in authority from those countries now don't feel comfortable bringing their regular cell phone to the United States. That is a quite stunning level of deterrence that we are introducing. And so I don't think that gets put back in the bottle. We are seeing precedence set in terms of the wielding of the presidential authority in arbitrary ways that will be followed by future presidents. There's a term in physics that I was involved in importing into economics that I think very much applies here. The term is hysteresis, a physical system which is a ball and a bowl has only one equilibrium. Wherever it starts, the ball rolls to the bottom of the bowl. A ball on a football field has lots of equilibrium. Wherever the ball gets kicked, it stops and it rests. And systems are sometimes subject to a kind of cyclicality. Joe McCarthy came, the system processed through Joe McCarthy, and yes, it contributed to some dynamics in the 1960s, but you would probably have said that by 1970, whatever America's problems were, they were kind of not very different because we had the very bad Joe McCarthy episode."
zPfFK1ohaoe,21357,Anne Applebaum,"The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia? And we have analyzed this many times back and forth, and we've heard all the possible explanations, and none of them has ever really made any sense. I mean, none of it really adds up. As for Europeans, the first part of your question... So yes, Europe now-actually this has been true for a while, this has been true for more than a year-Europe in total gives more money to Ukraine than the United States does. And that's both money..."
hyQm6oJB6MJ,20299,Anne Applebaum,"That's what I see. Yeah, that's very helpful and comprehensive. I mean, one question, well two questions I guess, one is just how much do you think, and there's one more Ukraine-specific and the war-specific, the drying up of USAID, it doesn't seem to have quite as bad an effect of some of us feared. I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians."
bhQsIfvkU4m,20402,Anne Applebaum,"There was something he said a couple of days ago about how Ukraine is a small country, it shouldn't have gone to war with a big country. I mean, first of all, who invaded who? But there's this constant refusal to recognize this achievement, the holding the line. It is a smaller country, it is fighting a bigger country. And it had a lot of disadvantages. I mean, it still was a partially Soviet army. It has fewer people, all those things. And yet it's true, the collapse that people kept predicting never happened. Yeah. Say a word about, I mean, let's get to maybe to Europe more broadly. And obviously Europe has many different countries, as you know very, very well. Better than I, and different governments, and so we can break it up a bit if we want, but I just was struck... Again, I think people hear, it all happened so fast. That Friday Summit in Alaska, Monday meeting with Zelensky, Europeans get together with Zelensky over the weekend, and suddenly the most important European leaders are showing up here. I mean, it's pretty amazing, actually. I don't recall even quite seeing anything like that in my years of being in and watching and being around government."
BmNRhONTika,19502,Anne Applebaum,"And when he refused to give back the classified documents, which he was storing in Mar-a-Lago in his hotel, eventually somebody went in and said, ""We own these documents."" None of that happened with Bolton. We don't know why he was being investigated. And we do know that the head of the FBI tweeted about this investigation. So the politicization of these. This is a textbook case of how democracies go wrong and how countries become authoritarian or how people lose their rights is when you politicize agencies that are supposed to be neutral when there is no rule of law. And instead, there's rule by law. Rule by law means that the law is what the President decides it is. So instead of having courts that make decisions based on the constitution, instead of having an FBI that investigates people based on whether they think they broke the law, instead you have this personalized and politicized organs of the state. And that is completely un-American, it's completely undemocratic. And again, I imagine in this case, I'm sure there are precedents in American history, for example, in the South, in the 1920s or in the late 19th century. I'm sure we could find at the state level this kind of politicization, Huey Long's Louisiana, for example."
rah-gGL2jFA,24847,Anne Applebaum,"I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for."
U42BOJTEvS3,6758,Tim Snyder,"It's all the succession of strong men. He doesn't pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He's kind of a link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it's ultimately about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in Ukraine, there's so much bloodshed, is clarifying. It's because that is in fact what people like. It's not just that they're tolerating it, it's what they like. Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not literally necessarily '20s, '30s European fascism, but that's something... I don't know. I had the more conventional, I was an anti-communist. And then the Cold War ended and then we had various... I was on the interventionist side, liberal interventionists, conservative interventionists side, depending on the Balkans and Middle East. But I don't know, I somehow put that out my mind. You didn't because you studied, I think, that part of the world. So that's infinitely more than I had. But I think it's a real... that's not a happy revelation, but it's one that one should've of course known all along, I guess."
QFnuFtafNt0,6235,Tim Snyder,"I mean, for people who want to be fooled, there's still stories out there about the Russian language or NATO or whatever, but what they tell us every day is they're trying to destroy Ukrainian state and society. That's their war aim. And so long as they haven't done that, they're going to try, they're going to keep trying to do that on the Ukrainian side, yeah, they can sustain this for a long time, provided that they don't engage in ill thought through offensive operations or lose too many people. The main constraint that they have is that there are only so many Ukrainians and it's reasonable of them to be taking that constraint into account. Russia has more people, but also Russia, the Russian leadership doesn't care at all about losing its own people, whereas Ukrainian leadership to its great credit, does care. They have to balance preserving territory, winning the war and not losing too many people on the battlefield. But I think they've been very clever about things that look asymmetric like these sea drones. They've been very clever about how they fought the war so far. And again, so I think so long as we subjectively act as though they can win the war, I think they can eventually win the war."
TeUW0DWq0fi,6112,Tim Snyder,"The basic principle of international order is that countries shouldn't be invading other countries and changing territory. They have held off, in large measure, a genocide. Wherever the Russians occupy, they have been killing people, kidnapping people, raping people. Holding off a genocide is not something just that Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It's also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. There won't be a war in Europe so long as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army, because there's no way the Russian army can fight another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course, it can. And in my view anyway, they've made a war with China much less likely because they're showing how offensive operations are complicated and unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist Party that doesn't want to be embarrassed is going to pay attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who are willing to take risks for democracy, which is a pretty important example, I think, for us and for everybody. They're doing all those things for us. I think that's where the conversation should start."
UNwE8cZ6snd,6535,Tim Snyder,"That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that's very explicitly in their mind, that if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia? Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this- No, no. ...forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own... We have bubbles within a bubble, but there's one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often... I just put it very bluntly. We often just don't recognize that there's a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes."
cDYzqjIjszq,6442,Tim Snyder,"And that basically got laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay and they were going to fight. I didn't think they would do as well as they ended up doing. So here I'm going to join in your expectation. I want to start there somewhere else, which is why, I'm just going to pose it a different way, which is why didn't we take Ukraine seriously or to put it in the sharpest possible term, why was our expectation the same as Russia's expectation? Because both inside the Kremlin and inside the Beltway and inside the Beltway among both Republicans and Democrats, the expectation was Ukraine is going to fold in a few days. And why did we have that expectation? And I think that expectation arises from the deep fundamentals, the imponderabilia, the things that come before we even start talking about history or strategy or politics. I think that comes from a kind of very deep Russian subjective victory, which is Americans and most people in the West until 2022, somewhere deep down thought Russia's a real place and Ukraine is not a real place. And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud."
hEN3so3OxYg,10775,Mark Esper,"It does seem to me, and obviously I've never been a fan of his, but early on, he must have had a sense maybe more in 2017, 2019, more in 2019, as you've said, though, than 2020, that he doesn't know everything. He does need some professionals around him. He would sometimes at least often take their advice or look the other way as you didn't quite do things that he had off the cuff wanted you to do or whatever and so forth. But it does feel like since 2020, that process, let's say, of liberating himself from these different constraints and guardrails I would call them has accelerated. If anything, it hasn't gone back. He didn't rethink everything after January 6, 2021 and say, ""You know what? I should have listened to Mike Pence. I should have listened to Mark Esper. I should have listened to Bill Barr. I shouldn't have gone down any of these paths."" Well, look, every president learns on a job. There's no training to be president, although, some have less of a learning curve than others. George, again, H.W. Bush, who knew D.C., he knew the instruments of government is an example of somebody who had less of a learning curve."
F3AZu3IqoPm,10759,Mark Esper,"The other thing is, you know better than I mean, going from 1% to 2% doesn't sound like that much in a funny way, but for them psychologically, that's a huge jump. Absolutely. That 1% has been kind of a pacifist Japan post-World War II thing- That's right. ...for 80 years. Yeah, it's more than just a number, it is a psychological threshold. It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades. It's really about China and it's about China, Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese naval vessels in Japanese waters, in Japanese exclusive economic zones, sailing around the Senkakus, which I think the Japanese recognizes. And by the way, it's not just them who are saying fund Ukraine, it's Taiwan too is saying, because they recognize the common principle at stake here. And the common principle is this, if a big authoritarian neighbor invades a smaller democracy for the sole purpose of seizing that territory and incorporating it into their own domain, we need to fight for those principles or else the global order that we've known that's produced peace and prosperity for the last 75 plus years is going to wither away."
n0pzlQY1wWm,11343,Mark Esper,"And we all know now that there was that, I guess a meeting in late December with I think maybe it was Mike Flynn and others who said, ""Yeah, maybe we should send the military in to seize ballot boxes or to conduct another election."" I can't recall the details, but it was quite alarming that the military would be put in that context. I was concerned going into the fall that the military would be used at the time of the election when the results were revealed to put down protests to do other things and so that became more of my concern, immediate concern at that point in time. And of course, I don't think anybody envisioned that the weeks and months after November 2020 would happen the way they did. In my lifetime, if you had told me five, 10, 15, 20 years ago that there would be an insurrection on Capitol Hill and people would storm the Capitol and try and seize ballot boxes and threaten to hang Mike Pence, the vice president, it would be like a bad Hollywood movie. But it was real, and it should be a wake-up call for all of us."
zAmka3p744b,10743,Mark Esper,"What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think. Right? I mean, I feel it's pretty big I think. Don't you think February 24, 2022 will be like a real, genuine moment in world history? Yeah. Look, I think it crystallized again this notion of a new era of great power competition with Russia and China being the adversaries. And keep in mind, it was just a few weeks before the invasion that Putin and Xi Jinping, the president of China, stood side by side of all places in Beijing at the Olympics, and they issued their 5,000 word statement about their strategic partnership and alliance, and would just be a few weeks later when Russia would invade Ukraine with armored columns and mechanized troops. And it was almost like the Nazi invasion of Poland in 39. I mean, it was just kind of a blitz into Kiev. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability."
8VKkqLencZS,11506,Mark Esper,"And so the question will be is who does he bring in? And if that's the type of people they are, what is going to bind them? At least in the military, you have a professional military class who understands what its ethics are, what the norms are, the proper behavior between civilians and the military, and I think they will hold the line. But the civilian Secretary of Defense has a lot of power. I've tried to emphasize this multiple times. There's only two people in the United States of America that can deploy United States forces, the President and the Secretary of Defense, not the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not the Vice President, it's only the President and the Secretary of Defense. So it's an immensely powerful position, and there's other things that come with that responsibility too. So these decisions on personnel will be very, very important. And that should concern us, again. Yeah. And I think you were alarmed, as I was, when you were relieved and the kinds of people that President Trump wanted to bring in there, and some of who he did bring in, maybe there was enough pushback that he couldn't quite do what he wanted to do."
J61Yx_zfSAN,6988,Aaron Friedberg,"And they'll also be, assuming that there is another faction, they would be struggling for Trump's ear. And again, my guess would be in the end, that side of the spectrum, people with those kinds of views, traditional Democratic allies, I don't know that all of those people share Trump's personal affinity for some of the dictators that he's engaged with. But overall, these are people who are much less interested in talking about human rights or judging the quality of another regime based on its ideology and style of governance. That seems to be much more in harmony with Trump's own views. But again, we don't know. But to get back to your question, what that means is the range of uncertainty, the range of possible policies under a Trump administration is just extremely wide. And just the last point, it's not just a function of, and this would be more normal if you had schools of thought that are going to fight and maybe they're going to compromise and one's going to win on this and one's going to win on the other. Sitting on top of this, you have the maximum leader who's mercurial, capable of changing his mind, going from one thing to another."
2cW7GfP6R7o,7044,Aaron Friedberg,"I mean, there may be some things he could give them that we're not giving them, but that just would be inconsistent with everything else that he said, and saying to Ukraine, ""If you don't come to terms, we're going to cut you off."" Well, that's quite plausible, it seems to me, unfortunately. And that I think would be the most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens. That last sentence is so important. I want to get to it in a second, but I just did a podcast with my colleague, Tim Miller, who made a very good point I hadn't quite focused on, which is we take so much for granted that Trump behaves the way he behaves. I mean, how astonishing is it that he's with the head of a government that's fighting, of a nation that's fighting for its life against the brutal aggressor? We've been with it for, on its side, as almost the whole world has been really, the whole civilized world. And there's not a sentence that I could see, I skimmed the transcript also, of sympathy for Ukraine, of solidarity, of, ""Look, we so admire what you and your citizens have been doing."" You could then say, if you wished, ""We may have to, I'm not sure we can get the maximum war aims that you hope for."" And sometimes he has to make compromises you don't want to make."
425U85hfj-e,6717,Aaron Friedberg,"And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything. So that would be the first set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one domain has an effect on others. I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely. What are our friends and allies in Asia going to make of this outcome? And they've been very blunt now, Japanese leaders in particular, but Taiwanese too, saying, ""We have a stake in the outcome of this war between Ukraine and Russia because what happens there today could happen in Asia tomorrow."" So what would be the responses to that?"
j4JkeiqoKRT,6679,Aaron Friedberg,"Again, I haven't read the full transcript, but the bit that I saw that referred to the war and the consequences talked about all the buildings that had been knocked down. And he says something like, ""If they hadn't done this, these buildings would still be standing, then they'd be there for 2,000 years,"" or something like that. So yeah, I didn't see anything there. Praising Ukraine for its resolve, praising Ukrainian democracy for rallying its people to defend their own government and their own territory, sympathy for the losses. He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject. And that is revealing because I think that is the way he looks at it. And if that becomes the first kind of big fork in the road he faces as president, which I guess it might, support for Ukraine, you just said a word about the ramifications elsewhere. So say something about that. It's not as if these things, they do have an effect, even if he thinks he's going to be status quo and with respect to China for six months or something like that."
dxTbI10q71H,8355,Aaron Friedberg,"So the consequences in Europe and Putin emboldened, presumably, by his success, he would be able to say, ""I, just like past great Russian leaders,"" maybe he wouldn't invoke Stalin, but that's clearly who he would have in mind, ""took a punch, but we Russians don't give up, and we mobilized our industry and mobilized our people, and we won this great victory."" Does anyone think that he then is going to be content and isn't going to cast his eye to the Baltics or even cast his eye further to the west? That seems to me highly unlikely. He's expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything."
7gvVOUnNDnw,9768,Robert Kagan,"And when he comes out on the birther conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. So he summoned them to him immediately, and then he displayed all the characteristics that such demagogues have always displayed, including his crudeness and... He is a violator of all the norms, and it is precisely because of his violation of all the norms that he has this following because they see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America, that he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large. Yeah, that's good. I mean, the use of extra-legal forces and threats and even some terror, that's not... I mean, these are not the historians I've read much of, but I think labor historians would say that that's happened quite a lot on the management side in the late 19th century, and it wasn't a trivial part of the attempt to keep unions and working men under control. And then as God knows, there's a lot of ethnic violence and so forth."
yZJfNmPFs2v,8991,Robert Kagan,"I mean, you mentioned people not being punished. That's a part of American history obviously, and the kind of collusion you might say of the vigilantes and the law enforcement and official forces. Absolutely. I'm very struck with people have not made enough. I think Amanda Carpenter, who used to be with us at The Bulwark and is now at Protect Democracy, has made this point. Trump says in every speech that he's against qualified immunity for police officers, which I think a lot of people think actually is too much immunity, honestly, in terms of holding them accountable, but whatever. And he's for absolute immunity as he is for himself as president, for police officers, basically. They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments. They're in sheriff's offices and all kinds of things. And then you combine that with the pardon power, that's pretty far down the road, isn't it, away from liberalism?"
IrB1-N3u6T3,9058,Robert Kagan,"And there has been... That kind of rebellion has just...The idea that a significant portion of the country would fundamentally be opposed even to the general direction that the country was moving in, and I just think that we just have lost sight of how prevalent that is. Again, a lot depends on the leader, and this is where Donald Trump I think is important. There were certainly other anti-liberal candidates available. I mean, I think that we could name any number of, before Trump, any number of people who were on the anti- liberal side, but Trump is the one who has been able to capture this force because I think of his own peculiar personality. But the notion... This guy introduced himself... People, again, I think forget, he introduced himself to the American public as a presidential candidate in 2011 as a white supremacist. His first and really only issue in 2011 was the birther conspiracy. And when he comes out on the birther conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. So he summoned them to him immediately, and then he displayed all the characteristics that such demagogues have always displayed, including his crudeness and..."
Wi973ipfLj5,9915,Robert Kagan,"What he offers to them is revenge. What he offers to them is sympathy and support for what is effectively white anxiety. And whenever you say, ""It's the working class that supports Trump."" It's the white working class that supports Trump. The non-white working class does not support Trump, overwhelmingly in the other direction. And so I just think intellectuals in America are heavily influenced by economic and ultimately Marxist interpretations of how society works. And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that. And one of the things, that's why, in a way, that's what I'm trying to do in this book, is to say, ""Wait a second, we know what this movement is. We've seen this movement again and again and again throughout history."" And that's the part of it that I think people have lost sight of. We're so presentist in our approach to things."
f7wrD_pX-bt,9011,Robert Kagan,"No, I get that. And I've never claimed that I'm 100% certain that Trump is going to introduce a dictatorship, but I think any honest person would say the risk is high. Even if there's a 20% chance that Trump will do all the things he says he's going to do, isn't that too much of a risk to take? And then they have to convince themselves or convince us, or whoever's listening that somehow Biden is a bigger threat to the republic than Trump. I don't believe any normal person, any reasonable person could come to that conclusion. And so you have to ask, how sincere is that belief and how much is it that they're just cool with Trump? I just think we have to face that possibility. I mean, the in-between stage, and I guess students of the psychology of authoritarianism and stuff and authoritarian movements have really studied this a lot, is a kind of wishful thinking where you don't quite have to... I mean, you're saying they have to face it. They don't quite have to face it because people can deceive themselves about a lot of things, and so they should. But yeah, they can tell themselves guardrails will hold a little more than you..."
BYKe0-e8-5C,10390,James Carville,"And I personally liked Shapiro a lot, would call him a friend of mine, but it would've been a San Francisco-Philadelphia ticket. If you know, that is always kind of bothered me that we are a little too coastal. And it's fresh water, they decided on fresh water and not salt water. And it is basically that simple I think. But my number one pick would've been Beshear, but so be it. Yeah, I feel like that gets you a lot of the... but, whatever. It gets you a [inaudible]. But Walz, I'm so on this train and blowing the whistle and we'll rolling. This is the choice and let's roll. Final question. Speaking of VP candidates, I have a hunch that Vance could hurt actually the Trump ticket a little more than people think. Normally, VPs don't matter much as we've been... I think that's the conventional wisdom, except maybe for '92 I think where you guys were helped by the Gore pick. And '80, which I do think Bush helped Reagan as a kind of taking the edge off the charge of extremism. But do you agree that Vance is weird enough to use Walz's term that it not only doesn't help Trump but could actually hurt him?"
Llczfnv8s2q,9969,James Carville,"Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list. People that listen to this, make a list of all of this, ""First time this happened in the 2024 election."" First time somebody dropped out, first time they had a debate in June. So something tells me we're going to see a lot more first here. We're not done with first. We should have a running list of, ""First time..."" Blank. And it was the first... Very obvious, first time a woman's been ahead of a ticket or first time... I hate the term, woman of color, but that's okay. You're non... I don't have an objection to it. I just think it's such progressive arrogance to assume that everybody who is not white is the same. Right. That's why it drives me crazy. But anyway, whatever, first non-Caucasian to ever be at the top of the ticket, first to never get a single primary vote. That's one of my favorite arguments that I got. I get this a lot. I like to do kind of right-wing media, unlike most people because it keeps me..."

But do you agree that Vance is weird enough to use Walz's term that it not only doesn't help Trump but could actually hurt him? Well, I do because I don't think we're through finding out things about JD Vance. Okay. As I say, I think there are more shoes in that closet. And like today he gave a book blurb to Jack Posobiec. Oh, that guy. Yeah. I mean, all right, this is some [inaudible] stuff, dude. Let me tell you. And I know people ask me to do a book blurb and I'm very generous about book blurbs. No, this is like, you do the basic stuff. So somebody say, ""Hey, James. I'm professor of political science at UCSD, and can you do a book blurb?"" And I'll look up the guy and okay, he looks all right. Sure. It's a thrilling book. You should read it. It's full of insight and everybody's done that shit. Okay? We all know that, but man, this is a bridge too far. And I just think you're going to keep finding..."
Yb9jkMYlduW,9919,James Carville,"But the people were walking out and his reaction is, ""I got to keep them. I'll just get crazier."" And so he's like Brian Kemp. Okay, who's you know, Brian Kemp is Karl Rove's kind of wet dream of what a modern Republican should be. And he's just like savaging the guy. You could see he's trying to do anything he can to keep the crowd and keep them on their feet and keep them motivated. And like I say, he's an old comedian. Punchlines just don't work like they used to and he's just struggling. And do you think it'd be hard for him to regain his balance? I mean, it's hard to know, right? All I can say is we need to do everything we can to keep him off his balance, not predict if he can get his balance back. And I think the debates are golden opportunities because he doesn't want to do it. He does not want do it. He's got too much at risk. It's a multiracial female that he's got to go against and Vance is going to have to debate Walz and Walz is going to... Pretty confident in Walz's position. And if I was Walz, I'd say, ""Actually use a sofa to watch television on."" But anyway."
mBQjFGlQ-NB,10245,James Carville,"Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out. I was thinking about this the other day, and this is not a criticism, I think it's the first ticket in modern times since the modern primary system came into being where both candidates on one ticket, in this case on the Democratic ticket, and neither of them has ever gotten a vote in a Democratic primary for president, that is every race we've all been involved in or watched... In the early days, they only had a few primaries, Humphrey and all that. But still every nominee in both parties had gotten some primary votes, certainly from '72 on. '76 on, let's just say. And mostly had won the primaries. And then the VP nominees had often run and gotten at least some primary votes, especially if they were the losing candidate. Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list. People that listen to this, make a list of all of this, ""First time this happened in the 2024 election."" First time somebody dropped out, first time they had a debate in June."
4rXGg9OIz-J,12514,James Carville,"The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away."
GTTmKfP1cw5,10767,James Carville,"I mean, he acknowledged it and then he pivoted very quickly. And I'm not using that as an example. And Reagan, of course, everyone cites, is too much. He's too high a standard, I suppose, on a political scale, but it feels like they could be more decisive, whichever course he chooses to take. Or even if he chooses to change course. Yeah, I remember '83, the [inaudible] you know? I actually think he was too willing to move on. I think some people really screwed that up. I agree totally. Yeah. But he got beyond it. That's undeniable. But there was some... look, there's no more massive act of negligence on a part of any nation since World War II than there was about Israeli government on October 7th. That's just staggeringly... and so much of that was a result of hubris, of thinking we had everything under control, it was all done. And boy, when you look back at how arrogant they were, you could see how something like this would happen. And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have?"
4m2nHMabhKU,11140,James Carville,"Now the problem Biden has is he's not very, and he never has been, very good on the attack. It is not just that he's old, he is just never been a particularly effective attack politician and how much of this he can pull off, I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting. What about this, we're talking Wednesday morning, the 29th. The trial is about to go to the jury in New York. Do you think that has any potential for affecting anything? Could the campaign use it effectively over a month if he's convicted? All this coverage in all these panels and he did this. This was a good day for that. I saw the expression on his face and I saw this and we got a panel here and there've been so many lawyer panels that I don't even know what to even think anymore. But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal."
eWJUA058lEd,10861,James Carville,"I think everyone thinks he's going to pick a woman or a minority, but I don't know that he... I think he has a sort of view which is pretty cynical, and we may not like it, but that two older white rich guys, that's kind of attractive to Republicans, and it's not that unattractive to a certain type of swing voter who thinks, well, those guys know what they're doing. They're business guys, they're et cetera. Tough guys. He seems pretty intent that he's going to do it his way. He's telling you, ""We're not going to have any of this General Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn. We're not going through that anymore."" He's really laying the groundwork to say, ""I ran on this. I told you I was going to do this. Now I'm going to do it."" And I could see somebody saying, ""Well, if you pick another white male, you're going to get a lot of flack."" And he said, ""That's exactly the kind of flack I want."" That may be just what he wants to do. And I'm not doing it like you tell me to do it. I'm doing it my own way. And by the way, he'll have a point if he wins."
kk6JdhZ2OcT,10432,James Carville,"He's 42. I think you have an opportunity there, but you got to take opportunities at every point. And I think there's only so much Biden can do. I think if you've talked to them, they'd say, ""James, that's a great idea,"" but we've got to get him out there to say that and that that's not the easiest thing in the world to do. And I can understand that. But let's see if we have this debate on the.. June the 27th. Yeah. I am struck how much people just assume it's going to happen because Trump said he would do it. I assume Trump won't do it if he thinks it not in his interest. He said he was going to testify to trial. [Inaudible] he thought that. And you know what? When he didn't testify, it didn't cost him anything. There was very little... even, ""well sir, you said..."" so he'll say... he's already said, ""CNN can't host, they're not fair."" He's just going to brush it off and say, ""It can't be fair. I told Biden to take a drug test. He wouldn't take a drug test."" My answer would be, ""Will you give us the records that Keith Schiller stole from Dr."
Vnk4P7mzi_4,3652,Eric Edelman,"Oh. You're right, good point. Yeah, I missed that. I didn't think of that. So he went to three countries. Frankly, for a lot of Americans, and I'll put myself in that category, they slightly blur together since they're all next to each other and they're all similar backgrounds, you might say, but still very different actually in terms of their foreign policies and what happened in each of those countries. And I guess the order was Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE- United Arab Emirates. But since the headline of the trip became the plane, maybe we should begin with the famous, or infamous, Qatari 747. What do you make of that? Just, I don't know, meaningful? Colorful? Meaningful? Indicative of anything? Well, it's a perfect surrogate for discussion of the trip, in the sense that the trip was not about, as presidential trips typically are, geopolitics, but really more about geoeconomics. But in this particular case, it's geoeconomics with Trumpian characteristics. And I think Susan Glasser of The New Yorker captured it very well in her Letter from Washington this week, in which she said that the trip demonstrated that Trump really has no particular foreign policy doctrine."
KF3pgDLdCiF,3527,Eric Edelman,"What do you make of that and what was that about? So it was actually... The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria. We had put in place an enormous number of sanctions on individuals and entities in Syria as a result of the very destructive 15 year long Syrian Civil War, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, created a massive outflow of refugees from Syria and internally displaced people in Syria. And this was done, the president said quite openly, essentially at the behest of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and President Erdoğan of Turkey, both of whom have an understandable desire to see Syria stabilized after 15 years of violence that have wracked the country and disrupted the region. That's all understandable. And there is an argument that sanctions on Syria should be lifted, or at least some sanctions should be lifted."
W84jX3-L8s0,3784,Eric Edelman,"If he'd gone to Europe, certainly if he'd gone to Canada or Mexico, which are the traditional opening trips for an American president, there certainly would've been protests. We've seen major protests break out at hockey games in Canada since the advent of the Trump administration. But he knew that going to the Middle East, where he had gone on his first trip in his first term, he would be greeted with sword dances and with, as you say, camels and Arabian stallions and red Cybertrucks and fighter escort for Air Force One and all of the trappings of power that he enjoys and the kind of adulation he requires psychologically, I think, in order to operate at a high functional level. So it was, from that point of view, a great place to start his foreign travels as president. Technically, actually.... Technically though, I think we have to note his first trip was actually to the funeral of Pope Francis. Oh. You're right, good point. Yeah, I missed that. I didn't think of that. So he went to three countries. Frankly, for a lot of Americans, and I'll put myself in that category, they slightly blur together since they're all next to each other and they're all similar backgrounds, you might say, but still very different actually in terms of their foreign policies and what happened in each of those countries."
qpNUq0_kzE6,3687,Eric Edelman,"So one of the things that's very hard to parse when you look at the fact sheets is how much of this is going to be actually accomplished in Trump's term? How much of this is new? How much of it actually began before he arrived on the scene? He seems to be aware of this slightly because he's also told the press that some of this is going to come to fruition after he's left office and other people are going to take credit for it. He said, ""But you guys have to remember, I'm the one who did it. It was me personally."" So it's very hard to really get after these numbers. To give you one, for instance. In the Saudi portion of the trip, the fact sheet talks about $142 billion in arms deals with Saudi Arabia. Now, when he went on his first trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, they announced a 110-billion- dollar arms package, not all of which came to fruition. There have been questions that have already been raised about, well, exactly 142 billion's a lot of money for even the Saudis. Saudi defense budget is roughly 70 billion a year. So $142 billion is two year's worth of their defense budget."
LogpOzA70GY,3679,Eric Edelman,"He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document. It's sort of, that's also, I suppose, the kind of transactionalism Trump likes, right? Pretty vague about exactly what's promised to whom, a lot of ability to rethink things later on. Maybe he will use the plane as a private citizen after he becomes president. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it. The whole thing has that ring to it. I was amused also, I'll just say, by the fact that it seems to be something they've been trying to dump for four years. No one wanted to buy it. It's both expensive and extremely, I guess, expensive to operate. God know what the expense will be for us to transform it into an actual functioning Air Force One with all the security and other considerations that that involves. But anyway, I think you're right. Yeah, that is the shakedown side."
4GaiQk4-PDe,7650,AB Stoddard,"He may have immunity, but what about all the other people who don't? He wants to do this because he wants to be there for as long as he wants to be there. And if it's not him directly, it's his, I don't know who, his relatives or people who are totally loyal to him. I think painting that picture is a little hard because it's America. We're not used to that. And people don't focus that much on some of these more abstract, if you want to put it this way, issues. But I think the third term, is a way to get people to focus on it, right? Exactly. It's one of those things that people dismiss as unimportant, but actually could become the face of his authoritarian effort. It's critical because... I'm with Liz Cheney. He never intends to leave. He intends to die there. That's my belief. You'll have other guests on this show that disagree, and you don't have to agree with me. That's my a hundred percent opinion. I don't waver on that. There is a discussion as he tipped his hat to about JD Vance running and he would be his vice president."
UnB0LcO7PT_,7378,AB Stoddard,"Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Sorry. He wasn't, no, no, but I'm saying you're Former. Yeah, But that makes it even more astonishing. What does he owe Trump? I mean, he literally lost the job he cared the most about on The Hill. And that's what's kind of astonishing. I guess we'll close with this, just maybe do you think, I don't know, by September 30th, with all the drama with the budgets and Ukraine and NATO, there'll be a NATO summit. God knows what Trump will do there. Maybe we will begin to see-God knows you and I have spent eight years being disappointed to say the least by Republicans-but maybe at some point they snap a little bit, or as you said, maybe not even quite the ones who face primaries don't, but then there are others and maybe some candidates emerge somewhere who aren't simply, but maybe not, incidentally, the greed with which the whole party... to me it's just now whole generations of politicians who've made their way by being slavish imitators of Trump and lackies to Trump is, I guess we can't discount that. I think that you're right. If Republican candidates emerge who are critical, Democrats really have to amplify them and embrace them."
li198f6SxYR,7206,AB Stoddard,"So it's such a multi-pronged assault. And again, some of it you can't... Rule of law stuff, you can see why Trump wants to do that. This I am slightly mystified by in the sense that why isn't in his political interest to spend more money on fighting cancer? I mean, that's sort of a classic. If you look at the other demagogues and authoritarians, they actually often do spend a fair... they try to be the person who's vaguely in favor of kind of solving these kinds of problems. They're not ideological problems and they can throw money at it. What do they care? So anyway, but it is striking that he' so... Elon in this respect may be doing damage politically to Trump and as well as to the country, who knows. But what about the Democrats? They're the opposition party. They should be blowing, calling, sounding these alarms and rallying the opposition. They're in the minority and you've studied Congress and covered Congress a lot, and you know how weak or weak that makes you, even if you're a very large minority, which they are relatively speaking in Congress, but I don't know. What's your judgment of the Democrats?"
Ij1riAkm-T5,7358,AB Stoddard,"I mean, it was all seriously substantive and directed at what's going on. It got more than 400 million likes on TikTok, which means people from around the world were watching it. It was dominant on YouTube all day. Republicans are worried about it because they said, ""What is he doing just making a speech? Well, what's that, nobody cares."" People will care and that kind of thing will travel because Democrats are just looking, the voters are looking for some kind of response, some kind of a fight. So what I'm saying is I see a pickup between January 20 and April two. It's not good enough, but I see something is building in terms of people being willing to get out there. And of course they need resources, they need coordination. They need to stop fighting, they need to stop blaming, and I think they need to actually attack Trump's assault on five different subjects a day. I mean, they can't hide from any issue. And yeah, you can't jump at the news and that's what he wants you to do. And he throws out distracting things like Greenland and so you shouldn't follow that like a dog to the bone."
9sqw6pYexd0,7160,AB Stoddard,"Is he going to get rolled by Trump? But yes, Trump is going to just get on state ballots. His loyal minions will put him there, and he is just going to full steam ahead, run again. So I think it is, it's the headline of his authoritarian movement. He plans to never leave, and I think it's really essential that that gets into the media discussion. Eventually voters will pick up on it, but it's not, oh, isn't that funny? He's just doing that so he has more influence now because he doesn't want to be called a lame duck. No, it's real. And Democrats should treat it like a real plan because just days ago, he didn't even wait until 100 days or a year, just days ago. He said, oh yeah, we talk about it all the time. People want me to do it. There's lots of different ways. He's open about it. So it has to be a headline, in my opinion. He's not disavowing it. Yeah, that's really great. I mean, I think you're absolutely right. Yeah, I was just struck as a former chief of staff to a vice president, he didn't even have the courtesy or the instinct, I would say, to say, ""Well, of course my vice president is well equipped to succeed me."" And that would be the normal answer, right?"
g6gB7kUJ4sm,4154,David Axelrod,"This is the choice."" And now, we got quite a bit of coverage of him over the Easter weekend, he always seems, Bill, able to celebrate these holidays by just... He celebrates the sacred by engaging in the profane. Right. It's really, really weird. But he just erupts over Christmas, over Easter. I don't know whether it's because he's confined. I posited on Hacks On Tap that he's jealous that Christ gets all this attention. I don't know. I don't know what it is. But his outbursts over the weekend just remind people that the guy is nuts, and living with him is like a... I saw some guy in a focus group say, he was a guy who voted for Trump before, but said he couldn't again, and he said, ""Trump as president is like having a neighbor who runs a jackhammer 24 hours a day,"" he says, ""Just exhausting."" And so, I think there's some element of that that will erode some of these gauzy memories. But I think the Biden campaign has to remind people, and you and I, we may have a difference of opinion on this particular piece of policy, but the one signature achievement of the Trump administration was a $1.7 trillion tax cut that primarily favored corporations and wealthy people."
2g6mZx9Newt,4136,David Axelrod,"Yeah, that's what I said at the beginning. That's a Republican message. It's a little unfair. I mean, the world could be chaotic. It's not Joe Biden's fault that Putin invaded Ukraine and this horrible war that's going on. No, this is a way of saying... The Republican message is he's too old and feeble. Now, I mentioned the other day that they're more than willing to give him credit, Trump is, for masterminding a vast conspiracy involving the Justice Department and prosecutors across the country to persecute Trump. So he can mastermind this whole elaborate conspiracy, but he can't tie his own shoes. It's like, choose a horse and ride it, brother. Conspiracy theories do not have to be consistent. This is something we know from history, right? The Jews in charge of everything and they're weak. I mean, it's- Yes. Yeah. No, you're right. Two things, maybe, and then I'll let you go. Let me do R.F.K second because that's obviously out there. But when I was vice president cross chief of staff, and I'd been through this really before. I remember worrying a lot about some trip the next week somewhere. God knows what we were doing."
llCyjBG_kdt,4371,David Axelrod,"I take him at his word on that. But this is just a horrific situation. So that's a long way of saying one hopes this is at a different place come November, and that people rec- It's World's Central Kitchen. I got that wrong. One hopes that by November, there will be a different situation, that the war will be over, that some rebuilding will be done, that there'll be some discussion of what comes next that includes Palestinians in that discussion. But this is a real thing, and Biden's not getting the credit for what he has done. He's getting the blame for more than he should, but it is the lot of being President of the United States at a time of war. Yeah, this is the incumbent... Sarah finds it, [inaudible] finds this a lot in the focus groups. The world seems chaotic, and Biden doesn't seem to be on top of this now. Yeah, that's what I said at the beginning. That's a Republican message. It's a little unfair. I mean, the world could be chaotic. It's not Joe Biden's fault that Putin invaded Ukraine and this horrible war that's going on. No, this is a way of saying..."
cYgRMFn4EuQ,4176,David Axelrod,"He's a feral genius- Yeah. ...that is very, very clear. And even the stuff that we're all... I'm appalled that he put a target on the judge's daughter's back over the weekend and published her photograph, because there are crazy people out there. I'm worried about another Paul Pelosi situation- Yeah. ...where someone is motivated by all of this. That said, what he's doing is he is doing what he always does. He knows that he is at risk of being convicted in this trial in New York, and he's branding it. He's branding the whole event as a partisan, as he would call it, witch hunt and so on, and he's just going to do that relentlessly, just as he did by the way he branded the 2020 election in advance. Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months. This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these... These are strategies. This isn't just expressions of outrage on his part, they're strategies, and we need to call them out for what they are."
Llp1WZQuiVg,4120,David Axelrod,"It's probably one of the decent things he did as president and say, ""Look, Trump's not really against vaccines. Only Kennedy is."" Now obviously that would be a somewhat dirty, not really dirty trick, but- No, it's not. It's true. It's true. I mean if 3% of Trump supporters say, ""Oh my God, I didn't realize he was such a vaccine guy. I am for Kennedy,"" why isn't that a good idea? The danger of course if you do that, you have to be really careful with that because you could also normalize him for people who are on the fence and say, ""Well."" That's right. You also could... to a general group sort of find those points of similarity rather than differences between Kennedy and Trump and drive people who are anti Trump away from him. I think there are a lot of strategies that can be employed, but I think they need a special strategy. I think they know this to deal with Kennedy because he's not an idle threat here. He's not a threat to be president, but he's a threat to tip this race one way or another. Very much so, I just think you have a case where two-thirds of the country has said they don't want either Biden or Trump."
O7JScyuLyBh,3559,Doug Sosnik,"I mean, whatever. And the fact that they didn't do that, I feel is now maybe he just didn't want to do it and he's busy. I mean, there are a million things, right? But maybe I'm wrong that it's always such an easy interview, but I feel like, geez, can you really go through- have a strategy for nine months where you're not... They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report. And that was not great. And then he chose not to do the Super Bowl interview. And again, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, obviously in the big picture, no one's going to remember Super Bowl interview in 2024, but I don't know if that's sustainable for eight, nine months. Trump isn't exactly Mr. Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get... He's good at giving the impression that he's doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at least, and therefore people kind of feel like he's on top of things. Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press compared to Biden."
P6vhwvNd8Dp,3555,Doug Sosnik,"Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get... He's good at giving the impression that he's doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at least, and therefore people kind of feel like he's on top of things. Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press compared to Biden. So let me just say this quickly on the interview. These interviews have become staples of Super Bowl Sunday. They have changed over time and have become less soft interviews and harder interviews and more aggressive interviews. So that's changed. They had over 10 million people watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that's a lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people didn't want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the interview. And so I do think the Biden guys might say on his Thursday night appearance last week that if he took out a couple of bad snippets confusing the president of Mexico and Egypt, he took out a couple of those bites and it was largely a positive interview, but they only cherry-pick the worst parts."
cI7m0ORFEm_,3487,Doug Sosnik,"Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it. He's not going to be exciting. He doesn't need to be exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something happened for a moment, the big point about '68, though, and what happened after was, they changed the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he'd broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would've won. But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans."
OMeRx6v1T1M,3551,Doug Sosnik,"I'm struck how much the retrospective, maybe slightly inaccurate, but whatever, view of things were much better when Trump or somewhat better when Trump was there. It helps him so much, right? I mean, if someone like me, here's what he says about NATO, and I think, A, that's incredibly irresponsible and dangerous and B, it actually suggests what a second Trump term would be like and it would be much more dangerous than a first Trump term. But I have the impression, voters they hear this stuff, it's all kind of noise. Trump's just being Trump. He says these things, but the thing they have to compare that's fairly concrete is the Trump first term, or I suppose more accurately the memory of the Trump first term and the perception of the current Biden term. And I feel like that gives Trump a cushion that a normal challenger who said these kinds of things doesn't have. I mean, he's weirdly advantaged by being both the challenger, the outsider, the change candidate, and hey, he was president. I mean, there's not that much to worry about. Things were okay when Trump was president. Well, you're right. I think that most people have sort of priced into the stock Trump saying crazy things, but above and beyond the economic narrative that Trump will be able to put out about when he was president compared to now on prices and inflation and the rest, he's also going to be able to say regardless of whether or not he deserves any credit for or not, when he was president though, didn't have a war in Europe, didn't have a war in the Mideast, and aren't getting closer to war every day in Asia."
-0jEvb44euM,3540,Doug Sosnik,"But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC. So if something were to happen at a Republican convention, I don't know what they would do except I do know that the MAGA forces are going to decide what happens. I think it's quite different on the Democratic side. As a party coalescing behind Biden, the organizing principle about being for Biden is to stop Trump, and as I think I've mentioned before to you, he's the first person elected president since 1988, when George H. W. Bush got elected for essentially a Reagan third term, which I'm sure you remember quite well... Biden is the first guy since Bush to get elected without a political base. And so his base of support, if there is one, is an anti-Trump support."
SIQjpwl63MO,8755,A.B. Stoddard,"And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you're a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new liberal friends are, ""well, he can't get away with this. This lie is even worse,"" but I think they underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it... The open mic night is a great line of Mike's, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn't that bad last time. Then you say, ""Well, the reason he wasn't that bad if he wasn't was because he had 19 different constraints, both individuals and institutional constraints that won't exist in a second term,"" but no one of course is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn't stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think?"
b35d0r6z1Mo,8836,A.B. Stoddard,"And it's a tool for dominance. We've watched him now, it's my eighth year of watching this up close, and it definitely has changed. He lies more and more loudly and more rapidly in a setting like that. And he is the president, and he creates his own reality. And if you want to try to drop in there and correct him, you're just like a gnat on the windshield. You're just going to get run over and 'see ya.' So it was both a great night for him and it was truly terrifying, I thought. Yeah, I mean, that's so well said. Because when you read up on authoritarians in the past and on con men, two categories that Trump probably fits in pretty well, they get better at it. I mean, I thought in 2015 I think Trump said these outrageous things and these lies, and you could tell he was a little uncertain like, ""Can I get away with this exactly?"" And I don't know if you could tell, maybe I'm reading stuff in retrospectively, but he seemed a little more tentative, let's say. And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right?"
2ogvT8ILKL3,8726,A.B. Stoddard,"Or if it doesn't happen, he'll attack the Republicans for selling out on the Hill, which the base will like, and there'll be no consequences. I don't know. Maybe we're being too... I'm glad you weren't so you weren't watching CNN , Bill. But when he said, ""I think this time we have to do a default."" She played him tape of him in office at the resolute desk saying, ""We cannot toy with this concept, and it's far too dangerous, and it's not even remotely on the table."" Or something like that. And she said, ""Why'd you say that then?"" And he said, ""Because I was president then."" Yeah. That's amazing, isn't it? Like he was enjoying the fact that, if he could tank the economy and on Biden's watch, that it's no sweat off his. So it was one of the low moments of the night, and there were many. Yeah, but that's such a revealing one. I'm glad, I don't know if I'm glad, we call it closer to that. But it's appropriate to... Because it is so, I mean it's utterly shameless. You shouldn't be able to say that. Which is literally saying, of course if I'm president, I can't tank the economy."
MvQHqP0t2Gk,9006,A.B. Stoddard,"I mean, imagine that's not hard to do. ""Hey, with Trump, you only get four years."" I mean, they won't say anything about this guy. And so he had a great town hall for him, I think, at CNN, and he's just steamrolling his way. Many things intervene, of course, Bill, but right now his firm grip on the party is as powerful if not more powerful than ever because, what's the goal? To get away with as much as he can. It's to get away with things. And he's gotten away with January 6th, and the plotting of a coup. He's gotten away with being found potentially... first, he stole documents, classified documents from the White House, but potentially he obstructed justice and caused his lawyers to lie and everything. The more this builds, the more intense the support. And the establishment and the elites, who are not in the 2024 field but are connected to the donors in this deep sense of fear about Donald Trump being their nominee, are still powerless in the face of his strength. Okay, well, there's a lot there. So let's unpack that a little. I mean, A, do you take it that DeSantis is close to being the only alternative to Trump?"
ntNbT9cNsvO,8746,A.B. Stoddard,"I mean, once you got him into the diner or into the town hall, even if he was grumpy on the way out to the car, he really liked talking with people. So if you combine that with the fact that he hasn't figured out his way to defeat Trump. When you run, this is the most surreal presidential primary where you have everyone saying, ""Oh, he is the best president we've ever had. But I don't know, I guess I'm in this primary in case he has a heart attack or gets indicted."" I mean, the indictments, first of all, I don't think he'll be prosecuted before election day. And I don't think there's a jury that would convict him in this country. Because I think there always will be an outlier among the jurors. And then I just think Ron DeSantis, we've seen him in a jam after the Stormy Daniels.... I mean, he tries to ""on the one hand, and on the other hand"" it, but they're terrified of infuriating the base. And so it's just this idea that he's both nervous in the lane and then he sort of has no destination. He doesn't have that plan like Chris Christie's articulated, which is, you have to literally take this guy on."
yQKnwqQL2uC,6688,Tom Tugendhat,"I mean, the most recent example is Ashraf Ghani, the one-time president of Afghanistan, who basically fled before a Taliban army that, much weaker than the Russian army that faced Zelensky, and Zelensky didn't run. You know, Zelensky would very reasonably have been terrified that his family were going to be killed, and he himself would have been killed, you know? We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know? But he still did it. He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it."
unXbr-YcRTJ,6936,Tom Tugendhat,"And so I'm very sorry it has required the invasion, of the attack on Kyiv to do it, but I'm very glad that we've finally woken up. So I think that this is a huge change. Well, let's talk about that for a minute and get back to Ukraine itself and the situation on the ground, but that's important. I mean, how much of a mugging by reality has there been? Or are people understanding, though, coming grips with it? My father used the phrase, ""Neoconservatives and liberals who are mugged by reality."" And a friend of his said, ""Well, there's an awful lot of liberals around who,"" this was 30, 40 years ago, ""who sort of understand that they've been mugged by reality, but don't want to press charges."" Which I thought was a nice way of capturing a certain kind of, ""Well, yeah, Putin's worst than we thought. Who thought he would do this? I predicted he wouldn't, ugh. But on the other hand, we can't really go crazy and we have to work with him and energy and other things. And it's a big country, and China's more of a threat."" And so where do you think we are on the sort of Putin question generally, as you would see in terms of what you would take to be a sound understanding of it, of him and of it?"
lMErQwTUXV4,6703,Tom Tugendhat,"In fact, some Ukrainians I was talking to were saying that on the 23rd of February. I don't think anybody's saying that now about any country. The reality is that state on state warfare, I'm afraid, sadly is a reality again, and I think that's a big change because I think it's a huge wake up moment for even those who thought that we should be doing deals with dictators in various different ways are now realizing that actually, that may be harder than they thought. It's been a while now that some of us have been calling out the fact that you can't feed the crocodile, the crocodile gets hungrier with the eating. And the reality is, that's what Putin has done over the last 20 years. That's what Xi would do. That's what plenty of other dictators around the world would do. Yeah, the other crocodiles also see the success of one crocodile and that has its own implications. You mentioned the UK's leadership and Australia and others. One, I'm just curious as a somewhat more, not a technical question really, but I'm struck that on the one hand, this is a success story for NATO, I think you'd have to say, that's come together quite well and admitted to new members that will be excellent contributors, I think."
F0ue4k5den8,7045,Tom Tugendhat,"He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it. I think we underestimate the importance of President Zelensky's courage to the shape of the world as it will be in 10 years time. If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty. I think we underestimate that at our peril. No, I think that's very well said, and I mean, the courage plus competence apparently, in leadership. Yeah, totally. And a high level of competence. That's awfully important to people. Like I mean, it happens, and then of course, when things swell, of course, that's how it was going to go, but it didn't have to go that way."
Yv47kw1UZRg,7963,Tom Tugendhat,"And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people. This is a guy who has behaved like a mafia don on a global scale. It's quite extraordinary how violent he's been and yet how ignored he's been as well by so many."
PkKUi5S3Lc5,7138,Jack Goldsmith,"He's been emphasizing ending the fentanyl crisis, stopping crime, et cetera. That's smart. So we'll learn a lot in the confirmation hearings. We'll learn a lot in the first three months of governance. And I think in three or four months, we'll have a sense of how much the lawfare is going to get going, whether there can be special counsel appointed. So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years. So it's going to be very hard to say, okay, we now know what's going to happen because he could... And who knows which one of his new subordinates he's going to have fallings out with. He's already fired his White House council before and gotten a second one. He's lost one nominee. I mean, this idea that this is going to be a disciplined organization compared to the first one I think is yet to be proven. And I suppose just on the first three or four months, we'll also see these second and third tier appointments, which the overall character of which you mentioned OLC in particular, but will be pretty important."
sD1GyvexKvc,6766,Jack Goldsmith,"And there were some deep state shenanigans against him in his first term, and I get it, but this is all completely out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, it's started to become ordinary. There's so many things, nobody, just to change topics for a second, nobody in this election talked about tax disclosure, very few people. That was a big deal in 2016, 2020. Trump defied it twice, and now, nobody cares. And it had been in practice for, what, 40 years or something like that? Going back to Watergate, going back either to Ford or Carter, I can't remember. And same with conflict of interest rules, very little discussion of that. Now, it's just accepted, now, that they're not going to follow the statutory rules, almost very few of them, and none of the important ones apply to the president. So he's, by continually defying these things, then by nothing happening over the last four years, they're no longer being held up as norms. They're not even being discussed. And that's a Trump success. And the president personally has often been not covered by these rules or only covered as a matter of courtesy or norms like with the tax."
DoMqSREk8R8,7499,Jack Goldsmith,"And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime. It may be that previous Justice Departments have overreached in indicting people for things or investigating people for things, but there's at least been the claim that there's an actual statute somewhere in the, what's it called, the code of whatever it's called, the legal code. UC Code, yeah. Yeah. There's like Statue 1274, which someone violated. Well, we don't usually... Let me just back. Yes, first of all, I wasn't surprised, because he did that all throughout his first term. He did it all throughout the campaign. So the thing that surprised me last Sunday was the moderating part, not the part about people needing to go to jail. Yeah, we don't typically have presidents talking about who should go to jail. Biden actually did once in violating norms during his term and said some other things he shouldn't have said. But typically, presidents don't even talk about this stuff."
5AKCgbT2Oke,7024,Jack Goldsmith,"Yeah, we don't typically have presidents talking about who should go to jail. Biden actually did once in violating norms during his term and said some other things he shouldn't have said. But typically, presidents don't even talk about this stuff. And typically, law enforcement doesn't talk about people going to jail. They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump. And let me just say, part of what Trump is about is to just blow up all these norms. He thinks or talks or acts as if he thinks that they're just illegitimate, that they're corrupt, that the Justice Department is under the control of the deep state or the Democrats or some combination of both. And there were some deep state shenanigans against him in his first term, and I get it, but this is all completely out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, it's started to become ordinary. There's so many things, nobody, just to change topics for a second, nobody in this election talked about tax disclosure, very few people."
mPGe16IO_Ce,7819,Jack Goldsmith,"Anyway, because it was his son, because he promised he wouldn't do it, it sets a bad precedent, obviously. Yeah. The promise that he wouldn't do it, I think, it was also a bad precedent, again, certainly going forward. I mean, I guess, Trump, since you mentioned that he really blew up some of these norms, pardoning people in the middle of his term, or partway through his term, two-thirds way through his term, who might have testified against him or might have spoke... that's closer to the sense, for me at least, of the abuse that's kind of really corrupting justice. I mean, Hunter Biden wasn't going to affect anyone else's life. Well, I mean, I don't follow these things. There's a claim that Hunter could potentially implicate his father. Well, fair enough. That's true. I don't follow these things, and in fact, though the pardon makes that... Because now I think he loses some of his immunity to testify. But anyway, I haven't studied those claims. I agree. Trump was incomparable in his abuse. Many dozens... And I think Hunter's actually listed all of these and studied them all. I have a chart on this, and I think something like, I can't remember the number, but the person I did it with, we concluded that about 70% of the pardons were for friends or friends of friends."
te1XKuICx8F,19438,Anne Applebaum,"I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress? And I'm the last person to put any hopes in them at this point, but half of them did vote for aide for Ukraine less than a year ago. Are they literally going to, just because Trump decides he's... Not decides. Trump has been a friend of Putin's and remains a friend of Putin's so to speak, or an ally Putin's almost. Are they simply going to give up on that? It wouldn't take that many Republicans to join the Democrats to conceivably stop Trump from doing a [aid] package, even? I guess I'm slightly more hopeful than some people that... I mean, generally presidents have a huge amount of power on foreign policy, very hard to override them when they're going at a certain direction. And sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time, it's very bad, I think. But I don't know. So for whatever it's worth my sense of if it could snowball in a very bad direction, or the opposite could happen. If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful."
xvgCtIseNqR,21221,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point."
FtrW79XRI6E,19204,Anne Applebaum,"So the Russians aren't showing any indication that they want to stop. But the Ukrainians are able to hit thousands of Russian targets every month. I've seen the list of what they can hit. They are killing far more, something like seven to one. So they kill seven times more Russians than Ukrainians. They are in a position to continue fighting, I would guess, for at least six months and maybe a year without that much more help. So it's not as dire as you think. I mean, the thing that worries me the most about Ukraine is a psychological, what will it mean to Ukrainians if the US government turns on them? Will people become demoralized? That I just don't know. Wars have also psychological elements, and the Ukrainians, that's why they pushed back against the Russians in 2022. This is why Kiev wasn't taken because the Ukrainians said, ""No, we're brave and we're going to stop them,"" and they did. And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards."
lZFZFony8gE,20594,Anne Applebaum,"Not just because they legally could say, ""I'm sorry, I can't do that."" They had a whole network. They were well-established figures. They had many, many friends and colleagues across the military and across the US government. If General Milley to take an obvious example in 2020 had resigned, all the other chiefs would've resigned. A ton of three-star generals would've resigned. Maybe the Secretary of State would've felt he had to resign, Pompeo. I mean, the degree to which Trump has got people who have no authority or independent standing. I think your own work on autocracy has emphasized that point, and he's gone further in that direction, I guess, than even I expected. I think it's also really important to understand that this is not a conservative movement. It's not even... I wouldn't even say it's a right-wing movement. I mean, it's the wrong way to think about it. It's something... This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are not based in reality. They are skeptical of science. They're skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before."
YktGqiPv3z4,20986,Anne Applebaum,"All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another. And really very suddenly all that looks different. And I can't tell you right now exactly what the implications will be or whether it can be reversed by further actions down the line. I mean, I suspect among other things that Putin doesn't really want to end the war. And so, I don't know exactly what the... I still have no idea what Trump is talking about when he says the war will end this week or it'll end by May. I'm not sure what he means. But all those things suddenly begin to look different. And the conversations happen in all kinds of contexts. So in boardrooms, in government offices, everyone who deals with the United States in any context is suddenly saying, ""Wait, are all the assumptions that I've based 30 years of decisions on or 80 years of decisions on, are all those assumptions wrong?"" And again, maybe this is going to be reversed and maybe it's not going to be as extreme as people think."
_viK2K3XlpN,6611,Invisible Rulers,"And you start to see the ethical questions, they get thornier, right? I feel like QAnon is the easy one. Before we get to the ethical question, I mean, just on the empirical side, so to speak, this does seem to be very important. It's very interesting. I mean, if the algorithm... I'm going to say this in a stupid way, but you'll understand. It's smart enough to understand that if you like this conspiracy in this area, you might like other conspiracies in another area. That has always been true presumably psychologically. I've got to stipulate for human beings. RENÉE DIRESTA: Yes. But in the old days, if you were a conspiracy theorist about X, you wouldn't necessarily have entree, so to speak, or be forced into knowledge, even, of a conspiracy theory Y, right? So the scientific kooks would be in a different, the vaccine people would be in a world perhaps from the, I don't know, QAnon types and from other kinds of conspiracies. So that has to be one case in which the new mode of just the fact of the algorithm, I guess you'd say, the new mode of transmission of these things, both rewards conspiracies, because they stay online longer, as you were saying, and they are more passionate and intense and they do what the algorithm wants to optimize for."
Kpln52V4s5F,6920,Invisible Rulers,"It's seen 30 million times. And that becomes... Because these people are so distrustful of institutions, the conspiratorial view of the universe holds. And unless they hear it from Elon as a correction, or maybe in the form of a community note as a correction, they don't actually trust the correction. They don't believe the media fact check. It never breaks through. Some of the people who are out there making the boldest statements... ""USAID is behind the Trump impeachment,"" is one of the stupidest stories out there. But Mike Shellenberger wrote it in his newsletter, and then Mike Benz said it on Joe Rogan. And this is audiences of millions of people, and they write very carefully, but they say the thing, and know their audiences trust them and are not going to believe the correction. And they're not going to believe... They're never going to walk it back. But that's the sort of divide that we live in at this point. There's no evidence offered beyond the theory, but that's where we've kind of gotten to. Well, or some sort of fake evidence of some, as you say, misread spreadsheet. Or they like actually evidence in the wrong way."

It's funny how they- RENÉE DIRESTA: That is true. Usually, there's a screenshot. There is a- Yes, there's a thing. RENÉE DIRESTA: This is what happened... In the conspiracy theories about us, they actually... So when I was at Stanford Internet Observatory, the same people I just mentioned, Shellenberger and Benz, came up with this theory that we had censored 22 million Tweets. And the evidence of that was in a report that we wrote. We added up the number of Tweets in the most viral stories alleging fraud in the 2020 election. And the number at the bottom of the table was 22 million. And so they highlighted it, circled it in red, screenshotted it, decontextualized it, and that was where, ""They censored 22 million Tweets,"" came from."
EQIeuuxET5v,6785,Invisible Rulers,"And for those who are not familiar, Coughlin is a Catholic priest who has a radio address, weekly radio address. He starts out as very pro Roosevelt, moves to being very disillusioned. The Great Depression is happening. He's tapping into the sentiment of people who are destitute. But then he also moves into eventually becoming a Nazi sympathizer. He's writing letters to Mussolini, and praising Hitler and saying, ""The Jews brought it on themselves."" And these sorts of things. And eventually what you see happen is, people have to try to figure out what to do about that. And the interesting thing about Coughlin though is that, normal people can't be counter speakers in that moment. Normal people aren't on the radio. So, the one thing social media does offer is the opportunity for instantaneous counter speech. Whereas what happens with Coughlin is, they try to make him pre-clear his broadcast. So they've essentially appoint an official censor to go there and see if he's cleared to speak, which kind of has some parallels to content moderation. They have a person, essentially a fact-checker, come on right after him to say, ""Father Coughlin lied to you about the following things."" And then eventually, the Catholic Church kind of yanks him and is like, ""Okay, you're done."" And I tell the story in the book in kind of greater detail because it really is an incredible parallel to the modern moment."

RENÉE DIRESTA: No, the trust point is exactly that, right? It is that we live in very different universes at this point, where if you... Because eroding confidence in institutions and repositioning yourself as the source of authority and trust is good business for somebody who's trying to sell Twitter or Substack subscriptions or whatever. That's where you start to see that. This is much more a problem of trust than anything else. It's very divided, and that's why that sense of how do we put reality back together?"
cskKgZjQmLV,2967,Ryan Goodman,"But, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, the Supreme Court can, A, it can order, it can say, we want to hear arguments on the merits as well, and we'd like your briefs by April 1st or whatever, or they can just decide it honestly without hearing any briefs, if they don't think they need briefs or oral argument. A year ago, in the immunity case, they went way beyond what was necessary, if I'm not mistaken, to write for the ages-was that Gorsuch-a very broad opinion. Here they went out of their way not to do that. So I assume eventually they will not uphold that executive order on birthright citizenship. But they haven't exactly gone out of their way to say, this is the Trump administration, one of its first executive orders is blatantly unconstitutional, which would've been an interesting way to end the term and it would've had, it would have had educative effect in one direction. It feels to me like they've bent over backwards to have an educative or non-educative effect in the other direction. You know, I mean, would've been very hard to reach that, right? I mean, just because the government, the administration chose to appeal, of course it did on its the grounds they thought they could do best on, but the court can say, ""This is a very important issue."

It's hard to say, there could be fewer Republican defections, so yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Well, that would be something. Well, if that happens, we'll have an emergency conversation here and discuss, because that would be very interesting, the Supreme Court fight. But this has been terrific, Ryan. Thank you. Really, it's a very educational and important, I think, conversation, and thank you for taking the time to do it. Thank you so much. I look forward to the next one. Me too and thank you all for joining us on Conversations."
_lm9fzm6JHU,3281,Ryan Goodman,"So, that's where I think it's not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House. Yeah, it seems like they haven't given him that many victories on the big substance yet. Perhaps whether it's Humphrey's Executor will be radically limited, or struck down, and we'll see what happens on some of these other Alien Enemies Act, even some of them that presumably might go against Trump, presumably on the executive order on birthright citizenship. But certainly procedurally, I guess is the way I think of it. Maybe I'm simple minded, but they're giving him the benefit of the doubt an awful lot. And again, maybe in a very narrow sense, some of those decisions are their judgment calls, or whatever. It's a matter of court procedure. It's not a of high constitutional principle, but the effect of it is to let him go very far in practice down the path he's on without the courts being able, while curbing really the ability of the lower courts to do much to stop him. And in that context, that DVD decision at the beginning of last week, so that was the sixth three decision on Monday, I guess before the six-three decision on Friday that you mentioned the CASA decision."
4197arSoosz,3128,Ryan Goodman,"Hundreds really. And that's his solution is much, much more of the same. Yeah. I mean, one last thing on the birthright citizenship, which struck me, which is when Trump issued that executive order, I think it was the first day, January 20th, I was on various Zooms and text chains, some of which you were on. And they were, ""Oh, this is a sop to the base. Of course this will be struck down maybe nine zero, maybe seven two, and the court will probably even just look forward to striking it down so they can get credit for being even-handed, even if they're going to uphold some other stuff."" What struck me about the case last week is they went out of their way to say not a word about the substance of it. Now, that's not why the government by the administration had appealed. They had appealed on the universal injunction side. But, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, the Supreme Court can, A, it can order, it can say, we want to hear arguments on the merits as well, and we'd like your briefs by April 1st or whatever, or they can just decide it honestly without hearing any briefs, if they don't think they need briefs or oral argument."
QvNoe7Pi5fS,3113,Ryan Goodman,"So I think that's going to be also an important powerful educative moment for the country. And right now, I don't think we're in a really good place to have that conversation. But Supreme Court appointments often create a focal point and so much energy goes into that educative effort. That might also be an important opportunity. Yeah, that's interesting actually. Well, we don't know if that would happen. I guess sometimes they resign right at the end of term. That hasn't quite happened yet, it could happen next week. Sometimes they wait till later in the summer, but yeah, there's a reason they would want to... If they want to be sure that Trump could appoint someone who they would think is following their footsteps, if you're Thomas or Alito, I should think it's safer to resign this summer than to wait until the end of next term when you're heading into a midterm, it could get delayed. Trump could be weaker, there could be more Republican defections. I guess there could be fewer Republican... It's hard to say, there could be fewer Republican defections, so yeah. I don't know.

1fUpoYU_7_n,3682,Eric Edelman,"They know that frequently he blusters. They know that he's incredibly susceptible to flattery. They know that he's not a master of the details, and so that if you give him a good headline you can make hay with. So, case in point, when Trump announced he was going to go to the reopening of the newly refurbished Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, Macron used that as a opportunity to butter Trump up, and then to get him to meet with Zelensky, which I think was actually constructive. So, people have learned how to... kind of Trump Management 101. That doesn't solve all problems. Obviously, if he slaps tariffs on, that's going to create all sorts of problems. If he pulls troops out of Syria, for instance, that could create problems, because then the Europeans might end up being some of the first people to suffer as a result of terrorist acts from ISIS, which would probably happen in Europe before they happen here. Although you never can tell. So, that's all kind of baked into the cake. The things you really worry about are things like he's going to pull the United States out of NATO. I worry a little bit less about that than I might have in the past."
_CLy6ebtGGk,3711,Eric Edelman,"Trump tried to get them all out, the so-called adults in the room, Jim Mattis and others, kept this small force there. Whether they'll be able to prevail on him a second time, up in the air, but Erdogan also had, like the Saudis, a family-to-family relationship with the Trump family. And the Trump organization, of course has business interests in Istanbul. Again, this was a son-in-law-to-son-in- law relationship. How much of that stays in place with Jared Kushner formally outside the administration? Little hard to tell, but as you say, yes, the relationship with Erdogan was a very cozy one, and that could have a role here. So keeping an eye on Trump's decision to seal down those troops in Syria is another little thing that people haven't focused on that could be quite a big deal early on. And he could be under some pressure from his own people who want to get US troops out of all these places since we shouldn't be involved in Middle East wars. Yikes. So after Trump gets this briefing on the Middle East, it'll occur to someone for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. He'll be impatient anyway, but it'll occur to someone that will, ""Hey, it's the largest land war in 80 years that's going out of Europe, and that you've pledged to end, Mr."
_8kBN3Rhuzu,3722,Eric Edelman,"It's the nature of black swans that we don't see them coming, as opposed to the so-called gray rhinos that you see charging towards you. Who knows what might happen? I think a lot of unexpected things can happen. The Russian army could crack under the strains it's under; the Ukrainian army could crack. They're in extremis right now. So, you could get a catastrophic collapse on the battlefield of some sort or other. I'm not predicting that; I'm just saying these are the kinds of things that could happen. You could get a collapse of the North Korean regime. The Assad regime, nobody thought it was going to collapse in two weeks. These regimes always look strong, but they're completely fragile and on the inside. Russia is more fragile than we think. Think back to the Prigozhin mutiny, I think it's arguable that had Prigozhin not lost his nerve, he might have actually taken Moscow. So, all of these things are out there. The Chinese still spend more on internal security than they do on external security, which is an indication of how concerned the leaders are about their own populace. It's the nature of all of these regimes."
FzGYukJx5jP,3638,Eric Edelman,"And I think as dramatic as the events in Syria are, and we can certainly talk about that, the most important, I think, thing that that represents-it's two things really-one is that Iran has lost the ability to sort of be able to reconstitute easily and resupply Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was its major sort of deterrent to Israel. And by the same token, it has been moving very aggressively to enrich uranium at levels of 60%, which is very, very close to having fissile material for a nuclear weapon. And so Trump is going to inherit an Iran that is both moving rapidly towards a nuclear weapon where there's an active debate inside the country between those who want to move-having lost all these other instruments-to threaten Israel and the United States, its network of proxies, to nuclear weapons as a deterrent against its adversaries, but is also because of the Israeli strike on October in the aftermath of the October 1st Iranian attack. Essentially Iran has been denuded of its air and missile defense, and so it's both moving towards a nuclear weapon but also never been weaker than it is today. And so Trump will inherit this, I think as one of the most important burning issues on his agenda."
QMyvruSZzFF,4001,Eric Edelman,"And of course, he won't have most of anyone confirmed at the beginning, and he may not get some of these secretaries confirmed at all. And Hegseth, I suppose, or Gabbard. And then of course, second and third tier people, even in a normal administration, take a while to confirm. Maybe this Republican Senate will be very, very solicitous and get them through fast. But yeah, I think the degree of just the combination of chaos and to be fair to them, challenges they inherit or they confront and their own management style of course, and then things that could happen and adversaries may be looking at the situation and thinking this is a pretty good time to... But if you're Putin, don't you think, ""Look, I'm going to call Trump on January 22nd. He wants an early victory. I'm going to make it pretty attractive to him here, to have a negotiation with me at a summit, and we're really going to make this happen,"" and he'll find some fake concession he didn't make before, or something like that? I don't know, maybe not. Or maybe he'll do the opposite attitude. Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine. Ultimately, he'd like to march into Kiev and maybe he'll decide Trump is preoccupied and dealing with budget government shutdowns, and he can just stiff-arm Trump and end up winning everything at 18 months."
86TRpoUymr-,13297,John Bolton,"You fight for that. You don't fight for the ones that are basically collateral. So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly. And presumably the Gaetz example would embolden them a little bit in that? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I feel like that weakened Trump a little more than I realized. At the time, it was sort of that's smart of him to just pull it. You don't have the votes. You pull it. [inaudible] to the Hill on Wednesday, you pull him on Thursday, you don't have a week of drip, drip, drip, which is often what happens in these cases and all that. But I now think pulling it so quickly and without really even explaining anything and without defending him particularly or anything, or I don't know, maybe it looks a little bit like, ""Okay, if that can happen to Gaetz, it could happen to one or two others if you're sitting there on the Hill."" No, I think that's right."
m8CvqO1nD8h,13463,John Bolton,"And that slows the work of everybody down. I mean, while I have you here ... I can't resist asking about Trump himself. You've spent more time with him than 99.99% of Americans and very intense times sometimes and very important issues in the Oval Office every day. A, I mean ... well, you wrote about him in the book, but the judgment, do you have a sense he's changed some? Anything you would say that those ... A lot of Americans saw him in the first term and decided they could live with that. Obviously, they voted for him, but it's four years later, I don't know. What's your sense? Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right."
dG9VwSfEOYC,13569,John Bolton,"He didn't quite ask that question directly? No, not at all. There's an advantage to coming in at the beginning of an administration when everything's fresh. When I came in, patterns and habits had developed that, leaving Trump aside, were very hard to break. I think Trump in 2016 was totally unprepared when he took the oath of office, the pre-election transition work headed up by Chris Christie and containing a lot of senior figures in the party, had literally been dumped in a trash can. They started over again. Most of the people in the first Trump transition had no real experience in government or in the White House. Political experience, yes, but government experience, no. And similarly, in the first six to nine months of the administration in the White House, there were people who had never been in government at all, let alone in the halls of the White House. I used to go over and I had talked to Trump during that period and others, and I felt like I could have stayed all day. It was like being in a college bowl session. You'd be in Priebus' office and Bannon would come in and then Jared Kushner would come in."
4o1T0a08HRa,15577,John Bolton,"Whether he can do it or not is anybody's guess. And again, I'm just leaving the personal stuff out, which could be disqualifying on its own. Just as a professional matter, it's not on his resume now. People forget there will be these confirmation... It's all happened so fast. It's not Thanksgiving yet, and the old Congress is still not in session exactly, but in power and authority, until the new Congress convenes on January 3rd or 4th or whatever it is, right after the new year. And that's when the confirmation hearings begin. Right? Right. And I assume those will happen, and some of them will happen in those first two weeks before the inauguration. Sometimes a few of them happen the week or two after, but usually, they try to do it in January. Yeah, no, in past administrations, many people have been confirmed on the 20th of January, they hold the hearings, they had the FBI background checks. The President turns over the nominations, maybe before lunch, after the inauguration, the Senate votes 10 or 12 of them through. That would be possible for a lot of them here. Doug Burgum at Interior, people like that, I think, are going to be confirmed fairly quickly."
p9woW6rth9Y,16125,John Bolton,"It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist. And I think our alliances are in jeopardy. I think Ukraine's certainly in jeopardy."
lvccR9T6v18,5006,Steve Vladeck,"And I suppose as I understand it from Project 2025 and talking to John DiIulio and others about this who know a lot about the internal workings of the federal government, if something like Schedule F, which would vastly increase the number of political appointees, the Schedule C's I mentioned before, there's a schedule, there's also ABCD. This is F. This would be a new schedule, I think. Trump tried to do it at the very end of his first term, and it never went anywhere. But if there were 40,000 of them, instead of the four or 5,000, I think it is Schedule C's, that I think he has quite a lot of ability to just do on his own. Congress sort of in effect either yielded him that power or maybe he always had that power to convert in effect civil service positions to political positions, which does make them hireable and fireable presumably at will. But I'm struck that they think they can do it with existing positions. It's not that you- That's the problem. Right. I mean, so there are two layers of questions here. So the first is, does the president have the authority to do Schedule F at all?"
bfK5uJOHZTV,5255,Steve Vladeck,"They were a rather small number- I mean, that's the key. ...were at least of this huge pyramid. And then there was this massive civil service space. So Trump is going way beyond, I mean of course every administration removed, if it comes in with succeeding the opposite party, pretty much all the Schedule C's leave and you put in your own Schedule C's. So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments. The point is everything else. So the firing of probationary employees, many of whom are not actually probationary, right? Maybe many of whom were 15, 20-year veterans of their agencies who were just recently promoted. Right. Those are not the folks who are- Yeah, the way that works is you're ""probationary"" for a year when you're in a new position, I believe. But as you say, many of them were quite very experienced and in fact probably were among the better employees because they were put in these new jobs and more responsibility."
p4Oa-L5H6Q1,4873,Steve Vladeck,"And the answer sadly is going to be, it will never fully catch up. And we're going to no matter how things go from here, even on the optimistic account, we're going to look back at this period with a lot of regret and a lot of woe. But the critical point, and I think this is a point that is underscored by history, is the time to sort of lay down the marker and stand up is earlier rather than later, right? You fight the war, not when it's best for you to fight it. You fight the war when you can minimize the damage. And minimizing the damage isn't going to make everybody whole, but we should be all invested in minimizing the damage at this point as opposed to any scenario where Trump is given more of an opportunity to make it worse. No, that's so well said. It's a good note to end on. You need Dunkirk before you have D-Day, right? I mean, you need to sort of save what is salvageable and also prevent further damage. I mean, the question of how much damage will have been done both internationally and domestically is of course we don't know."
6H7nCygAbJF,4886,Steve Vladeck,"It was a very bad situation and it seemed like the LAPD was just overwhelmed, etc. Yeah, I mean, the degree to which a lot of this can just slide. I'm struck by that. And I do feel like Trump blunders a lot, but they're also pretty clever. You mentioned their litigation strategy in terms of appeal to the Supreme Court, they seem to be laying the predicate for a lot of things kind of quietly. So I was very struck, Trump said, I think those attacks on the demonstrations, not demonstrations, but even the destruction of property at Tesla dealerships, which is presumably against the law and people could be arrested for destroying property. That's domestic terrorism. Now, I don't believe he actually signed an executive order saying that being anti-Musk, anti-Tesla is being part of like being part of a terrorist Hezbollah or something like that. But a friend of mine pointed this out to me, isn't he kind of laying the groundwork for expanding domestic terrorism? And there are... You know much more, Steve, than I do, but there are statutes where if you're part of an organization that has been labeled a terrorist organization, you don't have all kinds of rights or I mean, the government can do certain things against you that it can't do otherwise."
2sIHI8Ek0XR,4774,Steve Vladeck,"Certainly people were fired and there were prosecutions and so forth. Literally, that was what this was about too, also of course though, right? Reagan was spending money that hadn't been appropriated for the Contras. And then lying about it, but details. Man, those were the days. All I'm saying is, no one thought in Reagan's White House counsel office to say what we did was fine and right and all these restraints are unconstitutional. It was all, ""we didn't do it. We didn't mean to do it. We didn't quite realize we were doing it."" That's what I mean when I say those were the days because the whole scandal was the effort to avoid the fact that what they did was illegal, as opposed to saying it wasn't illegal. If we can fast forward to the end, I think where this ends is this Supreme Court is never going to say that the president has the unilateral power to impound. I'm not even sure there are three votes for that on the current Supreme Court, but there's a lot of wiggle room and that's what we're seeing. In some of the foreign aid cases, for example, at least some of those appropriations, Bill, are not mandatory, right?"
JrypDi5-dtw,5997,Aaron Friedberg,"They're not going to abandon Putin despite the hopes of some people in the West when the war began, that somehow, we could peel the Chinese away and appeal to their better angels and persuade them that they should be on our side and opposed to this kind of aggression. That's not going to work, Russia is essential as an ally to China and they're not going to let Russia or Putin go. At the same time, at least to now, to this point, the CCP leadership has been careful about not appearing to do things that might justify further harsh measures from the United States or allies of secondary sanctions if China was to overtly supply Russia with military equipment, for example. I should say, and maybe we can talk about this, there is now some discussion about whether that may be about to change. The US has let it be known that we have some information that suggests that possibly the Chinese leaders are thinking about providing Russia with military equipment, which would be a major, and from our perspective, escalatory step that we're trying to deter, but it hasn't happened yet. But even short of that, the Chinese have found ways to help keep Russia afloat."
3XwKlfJKiTw,5996,Aaron Friedberg,"If they do this, it's an enormous gamble. There's no way that you can think of it as anything else. There's no assurance of success, there's no way of anticipating all the second and third and fourth order consequences. It's a huge, huge gamble for them to take. And I think they would have to feel either that they were very confident of their ability to ride out whatever the effects might be, or that they had no choice. They had somehow reached a point where not acting was more dangerous to them than acting. And I think they're still a good ways from that. So, I think we have time to work on this. I don't mean to be complacent about it, but we should look at the broader picture and the things we can do to deter them by threatening to use or increasing our capacity to use a variety of different instruments. Which in part brings us back to where we started because I had this conversation in Europe with someone who follows China closely. I said, ""What's the most important thing you think we could all do?"" He said, ""Stick with Ukraine, win the war in Ukraine, make Putin's gamble really, really, really not pay off as they see the analogy and the lesson."" So, I was going to ask more broadly as we conclude what to look for over the next months and year, maybe in terms of US actions and other actions around the world that Chinese actions that might tip us off about where things are going."
TxouNLAn4ui,6339,Aaron Friedberg,"But at the 20th party Congress, he effectively removed from all the high- ranking positions, not that there were any enemies of his, but people who even had alternative sources of power themselves or came from other parts of the system that weren't his gang. Those people are out. He's put people in all these positions who are loyal to him, dependent on him, and in many cases, whose qualifications to hold the positions that they now hold seem to have more to do with their political loyalty than with their previous experience or their obvious expertise. So, he's put emphasis on control. The other thing, though, that's been going on is- And that 20th party Congress was just a few months ago. Right? Yeah, October 2022. So since as we talked of looking forward at it in our previous conversation and wondered if what you just described happened would happen, and it did happen. Yes, it did, and I think it was predictable. So, a third term as general secretary, he did not identify anyone as a possible successor, which, Chinese leaders have done in the past, which many people think means he intends to rule indefinitely. Because if you have a successor, they can become a kind of focal point for opposition to you if you're perceived to have screwed up, and he's not going to let that happen."
NQLX350NDLt,5952,Aaron Friedberg,"And then on the flip side is why not go all the way and curry favor with the West and just leave Putin alone? It's not their war. They don't like Putin presumably that much. So, say a little bit about that. Yeah. Well, on that side of it, I think some people argue in fact that Xi Jinping does have a personal connection to Putin, whether it's because they're the two dictators or because he has this residual respect for Russia, Soviet period that Putin in some sense shares. So, there may be an aspect of that, but of course, Xi is pretty cold-blooded. I don't think it's sentimental, but from a Chinese perspective, to have another authoritarian dictator defeated if only indirectly by the United States and its allies and possibly even put in a position where his regime is overthrown, that'd be the worst-case scenario. That's a nightmare. The Chinese can't tolerate that. Also, just from a geopolitical point of view, having Russia in the game is of great assistance to China in its long- term competition with the United States and the West. It provides it a secure rear area, it's inner frontier that they don't have to worry about."
LpxBl0xKfVw,6545,Aaron Friedberg,"The visuals of that are favorable from their point of view. So, I don't think they deliberately sabotaged it. But they're committed enough to that intelligence gathering that they weren't willing either to, maybe they canceled it, so to speak, or to pull back the weeks before a summit. That wouldn't have been a crazy thing to do. I don't know, maybe it just has a certain autopilot character to it. They certainly weren't willing to apologize or to say it was a mistake, which they could have. I mean, we did after the U-2, right? I think, didn't we? I think. Eventually, afterwards. Maybe it took a while, right? Eisenhower was caught in a lie because he originally thought the plane had been destroyed and there was no evidence. So, he got up and said it was a weather plane, not knowing the Soviets actually had the pieces of it and knew that it was a spy plane. So yeah, at times they have done things that are provocative on the eve of or during visits by foreign dignitaries. It may be part of a strategy to keep their opponents off balance. Could they have been doing this in this case?"
i_SIV3j1m9J,2755,Jason Furman,"Maybe it will shift back when people see the consequences on the other hand of this. I guess I hadn't really appreciated just how big that number is. Was that intended by Trump? Is the theory that you just need the massive shock to the system, or was it based on some different talk about they just calculated some things wrong and so forth? Yeah. This clearly was an answer they came up with and then they came up with a formula to justify that answer. And in fact, a lot of the different senior officials have said they had nothing to do with the formula. So right now no one's really taking credit for the formula. So I don't think this was a math error that drove a policy change. It was a conceptual error. And the conceptual error is that every time the United States has a trade deficit with a country that is evidence that the other country is doing something wrong and hurting us and taking advantage of us. And that is the core idea here and the core thing the president is trying to solve, I don't think he'll solve it, by the way. And just to give an example of this, take Madagascar, we run a trade deficit with Madagascar right now."
ugf_Z6NRmAy,2603,Jason Furman,"There's tariffs on Canada and Mexico that are scheduled. I don't think they'll take effect, but they are scheduled. And then there's also the president's executive order was clear that if countries retaliate, we may-use the word may-retaliate against them. And he's threatened a 50% tariff on China against its retaliation. So the announcements are all about more tariffs. And by the way, there's other ones he's talked about, like if you buy oil from Russia we'll put a tariff on you, or buy oil from Venezuela. So everything he's talked about is higher tariffs. That being said, maybe he'll do lower tariffs. And that's the whole point is who knows. And do you think this is a big shock, that is to say there are other parts of economic policy, obviously monetary, fiscal, et cetera, tax policy, but does this dwarf whatever's likely to happen in those areas for the next few months or year? Or some of what will happen in those areas is reactive to this obviously, as we've been discussing with the Fed. But you think this is the big news, so to speak, of 2025. There is one piece of news that could be bigger."
qwq4q3RmpZ9,2523,Jason Furman,"Maybe they're just going to stay out of making any investment decisions. And that seems a little hard, I mean, that's hard for Trump to fix now, isn't it? I mean, just you've been in the White House, you've been through some of these things. This seems like an unusually... he's got himself in a position which is, you can't... one thing you do want to do in public policy is correct your mistakes. And in a funny way, it's hard for him to do that, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, I was picturing what would've been going on in a normal White House over the weekend after the ""Liberation Day"" announcement. And when you saw what happened in markets on Thursday and Friday, what we would've done in the Obama administration, not what would've done, what we did do during the financial crisis-I'm pretty sure it's what the Bush administration did during the financial crisis-is the whole economic team is there in the White House, they're meeting together, chaired by the NEC director. The president would probably come in for some of those meetings, but he wouldn't be there obviously for all of it. And the goal of that entire weekend's of work would be to have an announcement to reassure markets, create a predictable path forward, and the time you would have for that announcement is before the Asian markets opened."
oWyol-fpwjy,2519,Jason Furman,"And that is the core idea here and the core thing the president is trying to solve, I don't think he'll solve it, by the way. And just to give an example of this, take Madagascar, we run a trade deficit with Madagascar right now. They sell us vanilla beans. They don't buy very much from us, mostly because they're really poor. We're not going to make America great again by selling more to Madagascar. We've now put a huge tariff on Madagascar. What will that mean? Well, probably won't mean that they buy more of our stuff and make America rich. It means we're going to buy less vanilla beans and have less of that in our country. And so a lot of these trade patterns just have to do with what country has what, what country's able to do what, what country has comparative advantage resource endowments. And instead Donald Trump thinks it's unfair and we can make ourselves rich by doing something about it. And just to be clear, I think there's not really any school of mainstream or even not so mainstream economics that thinks a zero trade balance with every country is desirable or possible, is there?"
uOZXD7a4lI0,2650,Jason Furman,"But he fired the FTC commissioners. He's challenging that. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor, depending on how they rule, the ruling for the FTC could also apply to the Fed. Now to be clear, I don't think this is the most likely thing to happen. One, because I think Donald Trump cares less about markets than I appreciated, but he probably cares about them some. And the market meltdown, if he fired most or all of the governors at the Fed, would be really, really large. Second of all, I think the Supreme Court would probably like to give the president more unitary authority over everything in the government except the Fed. And so they would try to figure out how to rule in a way that lets the president decide all executive branch things except monetary policy. That being said, the Supreme Court's a wild card. Donald Trump is a wild card. And I think this episode we've just gone through is a good reminder to care and pay more attention to some of the tail risks. It's not just Trump derangement syndrome to think he might do some of the things that he said he would do."
NVfWUq27dzX,7013,Aaron Friedberg,"I do think if Biden is reelected, we'll continue along something resembling the current trajectory. And so maybe the idea that the United States has sort of returned to something more closely resembling the path that it was on before 2016 will sink in and people will start to believe it. Of course, that'll depend on what happens in the Republican Party. And that'll be a very interesting question. If Trump loses in the upcoming presidential election, what's going to happen to the Republican Party and what's going to happen to the Republican Party stance on foreign policy? I mean, I would've said once that if you took Trump out of the picture, things would snap back and maybe they would have if he had lost in 2016. But because he's been successful, at least as far as he's been, he's now got people following him and coming along behind him. And to put it bluntly, coming up with pseudo- intellectual justifications for a lot of the things that he was doing on instinct or impulse disrespecting our European allies. So, you've got people saying, well, NATO has to do more, which of course they do, but that's different from Trump saying, I'll tear up the treaty and you're on your own."
X3yDZ52xAba,7040,Aaron Friedberg,"And they may yet do things like that. During the course of the election campaign, I think even while the election was underway, apparently they floated some of these surveillance balloons across Taiwan. There've been suggestions that they will take some further steps like penetrating Taiwan's airspace and overlying the island, this kind of thing. So people are waiting, I think, to see what the PRC will do. I guess my own view is the likelihood in the near term that the mainland is going to start a war with Taiwan is very, very small. And I think that's probably going to be true for at least in the short to medium term. I just don't see this happening immediately. There are things that could happen that could be worse and more difficult to deal with than what we've had to face thus far and could be more serious than a replay of these big military exercises. And the thing that I think the more serious commentators have focused on in the last year and more is the possibility of a naval blockade that would effectively cut Taiwan off from the world and have major economic implications. Of course, a blockade is an act of war, so they probably wouldn't do it overtly, but maybe they're going to conduct exercises and they're going to issue warnings to ships coming through sea lanes and so on."
jINXupZ6Oh-,6911,Aaron Friedberg,"Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly, obviously, for things that could... but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents. But the Trump thing is... I mean [inaudible], ""Oh, you don't like Trump, so you're just saying this."" But of course it really isn't just analytically so different that he's going to, presumably, going to be the nominee again. I was thinking about it. Take the Trump, take the Truman example, just a very simple way. Roosevelt in '44, and Truman in '48 all ran against Republicans who defeated the isolationist wing of their party and therefore were more or less... I mean, certainly in the case of Willkie, very explicitly, Dewey '44, a little more complicated, but basically there was no doubt we had to finish the war. People didn't quite see the Cold War coming. And then '48, very much so with Dewey against Taft, and then '52 with Eisenhower defeating Taft. So, in the early Cold War years, the out party basically resolved - I mean there were all kinds of things going on, God knows -Joe McCarthy and Bricker and all this stuff, but ended up supporting the administration's basic policy."
oxyOst6WmKR,6798,Aaron Friedberg,"I mean, again, I think he has said these things, but not in a way that really gripped ordinary people as I think it might have. And we need to respond to it by doing some things that we would perhaps not otherwise choose to do, like undertaking major increases in defense spending. Seemed to me that there was a window, there was a moment after the Russian invasion when that would've been possible. People made this comparison, I think we did when we talked last year, to the North Korean attack on South Korea in June 1950, and the decision that the Truman administration made to ratchet up defense spending and to solidify NATO and so on. Different, undeniably, and maybe less intense. It was pretty intense, but maybe it was different than the Russian attack on Ukraine, but there was a model there for rallying the American people, and it seems to have passed, unfortunately. Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly, obviously, for things that could... but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents."
oPenOXvSx1R,7466,Aaron Friedberg,"Of course, it's a different situation there than it would be elsewhere, would be in the United States, but nonetheless, this is a problem that everybody's going to have to deal with. I haven't followed this closely, but I'm sure I've seen references to fakes and videos and recordings and all kinds of things. So DPP won. Incoming president who won't be inaugurated until May, so they have a long gap between the actual election and I guess as we used to do before the depression. And there's a question we maybe can talk about that, about what kinds of things may happen in the interval. The incoming president, soon to be President Lai, has said that he will continue with the policies of his predecessor, which have been stiff in their resolve not to succumb to pressure from the CCP, but also they've gone out their way to avoid anything that could be interpreted as provocation, no talk of independence or anything of the sort. They're also committed to making ongoing improvements in Taiwan's military capabilities, to cooperating with us to do that and so on. So there's likely to be continuity, at least in terms of foreign policy."
aaHsjVplliM,6476,Bill Galston,"If it fits into some kind of narrative, it has this sort of extra impact. Do you think that's the case here, or have the Democrats done a good job of making it the case, or just maybe they didn't have to do anything, it just is the case? I think I can say without fear of contradiction that it's not helping the Republican cause, that the party's reaction to the events of January 6th, I think has gone against the interpretation of events that the majority of Americans endorse. And it is adding to a general impression of a party that is willing to go a step or two too far. And how much of an impact that impression will have, I can't tell you, but I can tell you this. This is my unified field theory of the dynamic of at least the past two decades. You have one party that is to the left of the American mainstream and another party that's to the right of the mainstream. And especially after each presidential election, there is a tendency, certainly a temptation rarely resisted of the party that temporarily enjoys unified control of government, to go too far down a road that the majority of the people are uncomfortable with."
R0HjQQfSpfy,6265,Bill Galston,"But it was the kind of emotional shock that didn't lead people to quiet resignation. It energized them, because now that it's been returned to the states and with a midterm election closing in, people have ways to act to express their shock and discontent, and it's happening. It is striking, and don't you think also, it made a difference that... I mean, it's been sort of pervasive. Everyone can imagine circumstances that might come up, that might affect, if not oneself of course, but one's family members, or it has affected close family members or friends, and if you're a young person, it's more your own decisions, and if you're a mother or grandmother, as you say, or father or grandfather. But I also think people underestimated the importance of the fact that it was a five to four decision. Again, not that most voters are analyzing Supreme Court decisions super closely or whatever, but this was clear... A five four decision. Most of these big decisions are... Roe v. Wade was seven two. A little broader spectrum, you might say, of justices, and it was entirely a court... Well, there of the five were put on the court by Donald Trump in the last four years, so it was sort of not like the court has been moving in this direction for quite a while, and there were some appointees of Obama and some of Bush, who were kind of on board, and this is..."
-Si1w5JLzjv,6703,Bill Galston,"He let off, as with his usual Midwestern bluntness, ""Hey, Galston, I hear you're the only Democrat in town who doesn't think this is in the bag for Dukakis."" And I said, ""You heard, right?"" He said, ""Would you tell me why on the record?"" And I did. And I was not a bit surprised when H.W. won the election going away, but for the Democratic party, as a whole, it was a third shock. This sort of plays into my law of threes, that for parties who are entrenched in a bad position, it usually takes three national election losses to convince them that something has gone seriously wrong. That was true for the Democrats. It was true for the Labor Party in the UK. They needed to lose three consecutive elections. Then it was true from the Tories who needed to lose three consecutive elections. So I do think... and back up. This is what the lawyers call an argument against interest. I know that some months ago, a bunch of Democrats, who feared the worst about the outcome of the midterm elections, were planning to use the then-expected red wave as the proof point in an argument that the party needed to reorganize and reorient itself for 2024."
6-pAL6tIyb2,6142,Bill Galston,"I've done a lot of research into public opinion on the question, and I think most people regard that as, roughly speaking, reasonable, and if you deviate too far from that in either direction, you end up being regarded as out of the mainstream. So an outright ban, particularly bans that don't even make exceptions for rapes and incest are just seen as beyond the pale. So from a political standpoint, from a standpoint of public acceptance and of the perceived legitimacy of the court, it would have been much, much better for the majority to rally around the Roberts position as opposed to the position they finally did. And how much of an effect do you think the extremism of some Republican candidates in primaries, and some of them won their primaries, out of some of the law, the application of some of the laws that triggered in after the decision... Has that played a role also, in making pro-life just seem generically more extreme than perhaps it might otherwise have been? That's hard to judge, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised, and it is frequently the case that parties or factions are judged by the loudest and most extreme expressions of their views."
b_ipkrQ-rGF,6111,Bill Galston,"Has that played a role also, in making pro-life just seem generically more extreme than perhaps it might otherwise have been? That's hard to judge, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised, and it is frequently the case that parties or factions are judged by the loudest and most extreme expressions of their views. This would not be the first time that's happened by a long shot. It's happened to Democrats over and over again, particularly in recent years, on issues having to do with criminal justice, immigration, schools, et cetera. And now the Republican party is learning what it feels like to be on the wrong side of that dynamic, which they are in this case. Yeah, you're right. I mean, if you're already sort of on the wrong side of public opinion, and then you've got a few people, or more than a few sometimes, on your side taking the extreme version of the wrong side, it does more damage, right? To the party as a whole. And it's also triggered discussion of a parade of horribles. For example, this whole question of whether states would try to extend their jurisdiction across their borders, and try to restrict or punish people who've gone to another state with a different abortion regime, that hasn't played well."
U46A2ZQmUjL,4742,Ray Takeyh,"But I think at this point, the variable that they have to think about is how the Chinese would react to that. Because China, as you recall, brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia a couple of years ago. And the essence of that agreement was that the Iranians would not attack Saudi oil facilities, and the Saudis would essentially tamper down their operations in Yemen where they were already losing the war. But Ali Khamenei didn't get anything out of that agreement. They didn't even care what happens to Yemen. So that's the angle that they would have to think about at the time, should they come out of this conflict, they will need the Chinese commerce even more. Because that's the only source of revenue they have for reconstituting an infrastructure that was dilapidated before this, and it's been battered at this point. So they have to think about that. Also, whether or not the Trump administration will invoke the Carter Doctrine, namely the security of these matters to us, and we will intervene. It didn't last time. Whether it will this time, who knows? So that's a complicated calculation. Yeah, it is complicated, but it just strikes me so much."
ugKvVGynd2L,4561,Ray Takeyh,"And it does feel to me like either people are ignoring what they're up to or they're not up to much. I mean- Well, the first phone call that President Putin made to Prime Minister Netanyahu. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. And the Russians have offered to mediate. The Chinese have issued a ritualistic statement by their foreign minister saying that conflict should stop and cooler heads should prevail. So that's another alliance that Iran had invested a great deal in. It saw itself as part of this new anti-American axis. They came to the Russians' aids, they shipped a lot of the drone technology to China, which they could have used today. And the Russians, all they did was offer to mediate this dispute and call for calm. So that's another angle that hasn't worked out for the regime as such. And do you think compared to 20... Remember, we had those big demonstrations in 2022, which did show an underlying, of course, dissatisfaction with the regime. Where did that stand a week ago, I guess I would say compared to 2022? And do you think this now supercharges some of those sentiments again? Well, as brilliant as Israelis have been tactically, Israel could not have succeeded if there was not mass dissatisfaction with the regime in the regime's own bureaucracy and own security organs."
MAb9JQc4BBr,4386,Ray Takeyh,"He was very cagey in the international scene, not so much in the domestic scene. So I think his successors will approach politics in that manner, international politics, and of course the successors of the Islamic Republic will be very much preoccupied with the mission of national reconstitution after damage that this revolution has done however many years is still in existence. The revolution has been profoundly damaging to the country. It's been damaging, not in terms of international program sanctions and military intervention. The country has water shortage problems. It can't generate electricity. Standards of living are persistently declining. It's been catastrophic for the Iranian people themselves, and I always thought they deserve better. Yeah. Well, I think that's correct. You know a heck a lot more about the Iranian people than I do, but there's no reason they should have to put with this, and maybe this does bring that home. I'm curious, over the next week, three weeks, I don't know how long a perspective makes sense, a month, what should people look for? What would be the tip-offs for you as you get up each morning and read 5,000 websites and catch up on the news that things are going in one direction or another in terms of the internal cohesion of the elites, in terms of the popular support, in terms of could Iran, could we see a blockage of the Strait of Hormuz or terror?"
P2Q9JdxLNNo,4529,Ray Takeyh,"And just on the military side, generally, I guess before we get to the politics-politics, it does feel like there's some pretty broad, and much broader maybe than people expected, devastation of the Iranian security forces, both externally oriented ones- and maybe internally oriented ones? I think The New York Times estimated that about 11 Iranian generals have already been killed. All the relevant commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, of the regular military, and the entire Quds Force. The building has essentially collapsed. So, how many people have died of that? Who knows. The top leadership has been so decapitated, but although it is capable of regenerating. They have appointed a number of substitutes, number of replacements. One of them was already killed. I think they're increasingly making announcement of two substitutes for every job, in case one guy is killed. So, this has been quite devastating to that military leadership. Again, it's a multi-layered force, so it is capable of regenerating leadership, whether it's going to be of the same caliber, or less so, that depends to be seen in practice. But that certainly has been one of the cases. Again, it's an ongoing thing, where you begin to see more of these attacks."
vmRwRSIBV4s,4745,Ray Takeyh,"The Islamic Republic will probably no longer try to reconstitute a large civilian nuclear program, big plants in Natanz and so forth. It will try to have a surreptitious one with a purpose of detonation with alacrity. That's the argument that they got to be making. Now, that argument has to be made in the context where their intelligence services are penetrated, their scientific establishment is beset, their Atomic Energy Organization building is destroyed, and there's a possibility of intervention given that air defenses have not been constituted. But that's the argument that he will hear from the right. From the left, his misjudgments would be viewed as different. And from the population, his misjudgments would be different. They would be criticizing him for his ruinous policies that has essentially destroyed this country. So he's in a position where he's a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in history of Britain. But he became a prime minister, came Suez, and he's discredited. Ali Khamenei, if he had died at age 83, he would be remembered as one of the Middle East's greatest revolutionaries."
bLMRPxs2oRf,23168,Anne Applebaum,"He's a business guy."" But, it makes him seem less dangerous, less threatening. I don't actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all this stuff. I'm not saying he's doing this purposely and it's a brilliant four-dimensional chess thing, but it sort of conceals the true, as you say, the really sustained and pretty systematic threat to the rule of law, the institutions, the norms that he's perfectly happy to carry out and pretty conscious that he's carrying out. Right? He's pretty conscious. And a really telling thing was said to me recently by a Russian journalist I know who's now in exile, who said to me that in the Kremlin ... And this will take a minute to explain, okay? In the Kremlin, they talk about Trump as the American Gorbachev, by which they don't mean leader of the free democracy and blah. Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore."
jKfkDmaYylG,20564,Anne Applebaum,"So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian. The people living on it are put in concentration camps. I mean, there's a horrific story that came out in the FT, in the Financial Times in the last few days, describing how the Russian plan to kidnap Ukrainian children, bring them to Russia, Russify them and put them up for adoption, was actually created before the war. And the FT actually found advertisements, I mean essentially offering Ukrainian children up for adoption inside Russia. So they will lose their children, they will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life."
e_xOe_JBuoQ,20557,Anne Applebaum,"And the FT actually found advertisements, I mean essentially offering Ukrainian children up for adoption inside Russia. So they will lose their children, they will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life. They'll probably lose their businesses because Russia nationalizes whatever businesses it finds in occupied territory. So for them, an occupation is the imposition of a totalitarian regime, and they can't live there, it will be the end. So they will keep fighting. And for Russia, it remains a war of choice. I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have. And so there could come a point when he doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, there's another additional piece of this, which is this war is over when the Russians leave, and it doesn't matter why they leave, they can leave because they lost a battle."
x1uW8JCIBhb,19602,Anne Applebaum,"Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore. That's what they want, and that's what they're hoping he will do. And again, I don't want to be conspiratorial about how much power they have. They don't run US elections, but they will try to influence the outcome however they can, because they think he will weaken the country ultimately. And, by the way, from what we know, the Chinese are only just beginning to experiment in this world. From what we know the Chinese agree. So, he's the candidate of the authoritarian world, not because he'll make America stronger, but ultimately because they think he'll make America weaker. No. That's so important. And again, even if Russia and China aren't very effective in their interventions and their meddling, and people don't like to think about this in America, but it turns out there's a lot of domestic support for that."
FHyk12zKTjK,21647,Anne Applebaum,"And so there could come a point when he doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, there's another additional piece of this, which is this war is over when the Russians leave, and it doesn't matter why they leave, they can leave because they lost a battle. They can leave because they are tired. They can leave for economic reasons. And one of the things that's actually happening as we're speaking is that the G7 is meeting, and at the G7, there are going to be a number of things announced. Some have already been leaked, that will increase pressure on Russia. So there will be money that was Russian assets that were frozen at the beginning of the war. The interest from those assets is going to be used essentially to give $50 billion to Ukraine. Also, there's new sanctions on not just Russian companies, but companies that are enabling Russian companies to get around sanctions, especially concerning the rebuilding of their military industrial complex. And so their economic pressure is being tightened as well. Yeah, it seems like there's some kind of financial or banking crisis actually in Russia the last 24, 48 hours with the people waiting on lock, can't get their money out of the banks and so forth because of the new sanctions, I think."
TpyIn3eHfL3,14388,John Bolton,"I just hope it's not as bad as it looks right now, and I hope we are able to repair it when Trump is gone. But this is purely gratuitous. It is a completely self-inflicted wound. That's really eloquent and powerful and a little chilling, honestly. I mean, I hope we can repair it also, but it's also how much damage he's done at 100 and whatever we're now at, 10 days or something, less than that, I guess. With 1,300 days or something left, I mean, one assumes that this was the shock and awe period and there's some version almost to the mean or some checking or some rethinking or some mugged-by-reality moments here where he comes back but can also spiral a little out of control, right? And that's what I guess alarms me the most. You just don't know how much strain... We're putting a lot of strain on allies and structures and arrangements that one hopes can... They've been around a long time, they can hold up some, but can they hold up throughout? That's the question, I suppose. Well, it is, and we're not acting alone here. If you're in Beijing looking at this, you're sitting around saying, ""How are we going to take advantage of what Trump is doing on Taiwan, on the South China Sea, on a range of other issues?"" And other rogue states like North Korea are thinking the same, which is why how Trump handles the Iranian nuclear weapons program could be so important."
O6HnWPBRBU_,12309,John Bolton,"I don't think the military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, which coincidentally is the anniversary of the formation of the Army is a good idea. It didn't happen in the first term, although Trump talked about it a lot, and I think that was a good thing for the country. It will not be a good thing to have this parade. And there are people in the Defense Department in policymaking positions in civilian ranks who are as bad as JD Vance and Tulsi Gabbard on a lot of our national security issues. So I think there's a lot to worry about on substantive policy terms. And we'll see if Marco Rubio in this joint position, even if only for six months, we'll see what he's able to do about that. I do think there is a possibility that there could be a division of labor between Hegseth and Steve Feinberg, the Deputy Secretary of State, he was the founder and CEO of Cerberus, a huge private equity firm, very successful. He had portfolio companies that worked in the defense area and in the intelligence area. He's known in the private equity world as a hands-on kind of guy. He could be, if he's allowed to be, play the kind of role that David Packard played for Mel Laird when Packard of Hewlett Packard was the deputy secretary and instituted reforms, many of which exist to this day."
shVvQiPDq2i,12256,John Bolton,"I think when somebody goes, they go, they may come back once a month or something, and I think that means the DOGE operation, to the extent it still exists hidden somewhere in the executive office of the president will also see its influence diminish. But that may be an opening for Russ Vought, that he will take over that job. But overall, I think more and more decisions will be made in the White House and fewer decisions in the cabinet in the second Trump term than in recent presidencies. I think that's the clear message going ahead. Because I think people will be afraid to do something that might front run Trump and make a decision that he doesn't want to make. And I think that suits Trump just fine. He'd like to make all the decisions. ""Well, what day should we file that case in the Southern District of Florida, Mr. President?"" Well, this is Trump. He loves to be the center of attention on big things and small. Yeah, I think it seems like centralization of power in the White House. And then within those big agencies, DOD and DOJ, which have very strong professional cultures, some people might say too strong at times and could use a little more political guidance, but obviously you've got the military DOD and a big civilian workforce and a pretty expert one."
IhJ_6uH_VvU,14842,John Bolton,"And I think we'll see whether a number of the other executive orders he's trying to float don't find the same fate. Again, it looks like Trump is succeeding in a wide variety of areas. The litigation is slow to catch up because that's the way the courts operate, but I think it's justice itself that's going to find it harder and harder to do the kinds of things Trump pushed his lawyers in private practice to do. And you think the administration ultimately more or less yields to these court decisions? Well, if they don't, then we will have a constitutional crisis. There's no doubt about it. I think the courts have been pretty restrained, frankly, in the way they've approached this. There are plenty of places where you could see contempt citations being administered, but the courts are building a record because they know every time they do it, it will be appealed. There's going to be a lot more work in the courts of appeals and in the Supreme Court than in prior administrations. So these are well-experienced judges. They know their reputation is at stake too, the reputation of the independence of the judiciary is at stake."
gNOdAFBfF8u,13438,John Bolton,"So if Feinberg can do that, if he can help make the personnel selection process more efficient in the military, if the service secretaries really do their jobs in an efficient way, if they bring some of what they've learned in business to help make the services more effective, that could all be good and let Hegseth do pushups in the morning with the troops and testify on Congress and things like that. There's a lot to do over there and there may yet be a chance it can happen. Where I think the biggest failing is occurring, and it just happened this week, is in the White House where the defense budget, it looked to be over a trillion dollars request for the next fiscal year, but as Roger Wicker from Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee pointed out it included 150 billion that he had added to Biden's budget just in the past few months. So that Trump's actual budget is a real cut in defense for the next fiscal year. We need to get the domestic budget down and the real defense budget up. So in this first effort by Trump, he's not achieved that."
