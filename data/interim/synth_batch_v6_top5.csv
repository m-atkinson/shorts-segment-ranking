fU7wicpHdEo,2975,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole. All of those are statuses that can be revoked by the incoming administration. There are different processes that they have to go go through. Parole could theoretically be revoked en masse on day one. DACA, because it's tied up in litigation right now, we cannot rapidly get rid of. There's a whole bunch of legal procedures they'd have to go through, but nevertheless, we expect him to try. And with TPS, the law does provide some minimum time periods before it can be terminated, and it's unclear if he would terminate it for everybody. The single biggest population of people with temporary protective status right now is Venezuelans about 600,000 Venezuelans. Just be clear, these are people for whom there would be a danger of being sent back to their country and that's why they have this temporary status, right? Yeah. So temporary protected status is for people... It's a status that the Department of Homeland Security can grant to any country or even subset of a country where sending those people back would be a problem because of armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other serious issue that would make it dangerous to send them back."
ziIbob_y6Sh,2876,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status. That's something a lot of people had not heard much about and suddenly became a thing, TPS. Trump could make it harder for some of those people to stay in the country and not extend their status or curtail their status, perhaps. How does that work? Explain maybe for a second. There are quite a few people on temporary protected status in the country. That's right. And I think this is a good point to emphasize that the biggest immediate changes Trump can make on day one or within the first few months is to legal immigration and people who have some form of temporary legal status in the United States. So, for people who have temporary legal status, we estimate there's around 2 million people who currently are in the United States with some form of temporary executive-led legal status. Over a million people with TPS, temporary protected status, half a million people or more with DACA. Sorry, it's probably around 1.2 million people now with TPS, half a million people with DACA and an additional probably 200 to 400,000 people with some form of humanitarian parole."
Rfh2zucR_LG,2809,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And it's of course, just to emphasize, it is a crackpot legal theory pushed by John Eastman, primarily. The disgraced and disbarred John Eastman of the 2020 Big Lie efforts to overturn the election. He is the main legal ""scholar,"" and I put ""scholar"" in quotes here, who has argued that the president can do this. There is no groundswell of conservative judicial support for this. This is not something the conservative legal movement has ever supported. Even some arch-conservative judges right now put in place by Trump have said in the past that birthright citizenship is obviously the law of the land. And this is not even something that's from the 14th Amendment. We've had birthright citizenship since the founding of the country. It's an ancient English common law practice that has been around for centuries. Do you think he will issue an executive order, which will immediately get enjoined in court, presumably just to say he's done it? Yeah. Pretty much. I think that's the most likely scenario. He issues an order. It's blocked in court within days. No court ever allows it to go into effect. That's the most likely scenario. Not ruling out anything else given what we've seen in the courts in the last few years, but I think that's still the odds-on favorite. And just to think about the campaign, the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, they have temporary protective status."
OTU2Ixw7gBO,2988,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"He can terminate them somewhat earlier, but nevertheless he can't do it immediately. So there is a minimum period under the law that allows people to get their affairs in order. And so that is in many ways the population that he can have the biggest impact on. So we could see 2 million people lose their ability to live here legally and to work. That doesn't mean they're going to be deported, however, because when you lose the status, you just kind of become undocumented. So he could render 2 million people fully undocumented as opposed to what they are now, kind of semi-documented. They don't have permanent status, but they do have temporary status. You could just get rid of that and sort of put them in the population of the undocumented and then make efforts to deport them. But they would still too have to go through the immigration court backlogs potentially. And then when it comes to legal immigration, of course he can cut legal immigration much more easily than any of this. It's much easier for the president to stop people from entering the country- Yeah, say a word about that because of course, the famous Muslim ban in the first term was that. It wasn't removing people who were here, or it wasn't stopping people at the border particularly."
irOl3U6AhWN,2882,Aaron Reichlin-Melnick,"And if they win then they get to stay. But most of the time people go through this process outside of detention and just going about their lives pretty normally with a sword of Damocles hanging over their head. Based on the Trump administration, if they just get more aggressive on raids or whatever we're supposed to call them, and the targeted actions and if they have the good enough information to know where to target actions and stuff, which maybe they do, I don't know, I mean, what would the plausible number of people... What's a plausible that President Trump could stand up nine months from now and say, we've deported X number of criminals that otherwise were just living in this country disgracefully, taking advantage of us and so forth? Are we talking about tens of thousands of people? Hundreds of thousands of people? Tens of thousands for sure, because even the Biden administration has deported tens of thousands of people with criminal records. The previous administration deported every single year. Now, of course, when we say criminal records, I want to emphasize the number one most common offense is traffic offenses of a prior record. The second most common is an immigration offense. So there's going to be thousands and thousands of people there whose only prior criminal conviction is a conviction for illegal entry."
UAp-COuneHe,6636,Larry Summers,"No, absolutely. I do really think that it is important though to understand that it really is better if you're unhealthy because you're eating a gallon of chocolate ice cream every day, then you're unhealthy despite having a terrific diet. No, no. No, I take that point, that's a very important- I think that is a very important point to recognize about our current moment. Right. It's a good point and let's end on it. And it's, as you say, mostly a hopeful point, so that's a good thing to end on too. Larry Summers, thank you so much for joining me again and us again for this very, very interesting and thought-provoking conversation. Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for joining us on Conversations ."
KK-IQQ8Vh2b,6660,Larry Summers,"That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that. And we don't have that confidence right now. We are not sure whether court orders will be followed. They might be. I don't think yet we have crossed the Rubicon into complete defiance of the judiciary, but we are sure sidling up to that Rubicon in a big hurry. And that is a very different thing than what we had before. Bill, the stories I hear of people who would've been inclined in various ways to be oppositional, but they weren't sure they could and be 100% confident of their family's safety, these kinds of stories are not what we expect in America. Now, I think it's very important not to have what people have started to call Trump derangement syndrome. I absolutely avoid any analogies with Germany in the 1930s, but I don't think it's necessary to avoid analogies with Argentina in the '40s, '50s and '60s. Argentina was a country where its standard of living in the first half of the 20th century weree in the same broad range as that of the United States."
Znzv45PfcIr,8065,Larry Summers,"I guess that's my... I really have come to this a hundred-day stuff. We're speaking here on, what is it, April 28th and it's almost a hundred days of the year, and it was a hundred days. That's a really a long time. A hundred days is one-fifteenth, I haven't done the math precisely of an administration's longevity. And if we're at this level of instability and uncertainty at one- fifteenth, could get better, but it could also just at least stay as bad or could get worse. If JD Vance were ever to ascend to the presidency. It is hard to imagine him saying that our long national nightmare is over as he ascended, and that is a very substantial difference. Richard Nixon, for all his many faults, knew the difference between right and wrong well enough to do his best to obscure all the wrong that he was doing. Donald Trump glories in the wrong that he's doing and wants it to be as public as possible so as to deter, intimidate, and cast a shadow over potential opposition. That is a very profound difference. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that Richard Nixon had to turn over the tapes, that he would. No one doubted that when the Supreme Court said that the New York Times and the Washington Post would be allowed to publish the Pentagon Papers, that they would in fact be allowed to do that."
CdcAJHdIEqJ,7317,Larry Summers,"Let me say three things. The secret sauce of economics is arithmetic, so I think it's useful to just think about some numbers. The average tariff rate in the United States before Trump's first term was 1.5%. During his first term with really very considerable excitement, he doubled it from about 1.5% to about 3%. The proposals that he announced on ""Liberation Day"" took 3% to 28%. So it was a tenfold increase. It was 20 times larger almost than what he had done during his first term. There are differences in view about how to interpret precisely where we are or where things might go, but I know of no thoughtful observer who thinks the number's likely to fall below, well, something in the 12 to 15 range. So we are looking at an increment to tariffs five to 10 times conservatively as that which he applied during his first term. So it's a mistake to think of this as a respite from anything other than insanity. From the perspective of what people expected even on election day, on knowing that Donald Trump had been elected, what today is regarded as an optimistic scenario is a high tariff scenario. So I don't think we should sort of say, ""Well, the tariffs may still work themselves out, but we'll still have big problems."" Working themselves out for the tariffs is still getting to a very, very bad place."
ej-bQ8f80YM,7034,Larry Summers,"Wherever it starts, the ball rolls to the bottom of the bowl. A ball on a football field has lots of equilibrium. Wherever the ball gets kicked, it stops and it rests. And systems are sometimes subject to a kind of cyclicality. Joe McCarthy came, the system processed through Joe McCarthy, and yes, it contributed to some dynamics in the 1960s, but you would probably have said that by 1970, whatever America's problems were, they were kind of not very different because we had the very bad Joe McCarthy episode. But sometimes events cast a permanent or near permanent shadow on the system, and I think that it is very likely that what we are seeing will have that kind of effect as future historians look back at things. And I suppose if the country fully repudiated this experiment and goes, ""We can never go back."" But went forward to a more stable governance. If it fully repudiated this experiment, then you're right, that might actually be what's happening. But it's difficult to do that. I agree. But I think it's going to be pretty difficult to do that. I think that an example for better or for worse is various changes in the way the confirmation power has been adopted by the Senate. Once that changes, it has changed and it is very hard to cause it to go back."
zPfFK1ohaoe,19375,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, the Europeans seem to be doing more. I'm just curious how worrisome though is that going forward, three, six, 9, 12 months, obviously if it stays basically dried up? And secondly, one thing you didn't mention that I think fits very much in with what you were saying is having Putin in the United States, I think people here didn't appreciate what that meant. I mean, he's been a pariah, justifiably so in my opinion, since the invasion, but maybe he should have been a pariah after the first invasion. That's a whole 'nother, but anyway, certainly since February 24th, 2022, and he hasn't been to any respectable European country, and maybe even unrespectable one. I don't know if he's been anywhere in Europe beyond Belarus or something. And having him be greeted with a red carpet by the president of the United States in the US while the war's going on, no ceasefire, no cessation for one day of bombing of civilians. I feel like that's a horrible, horrible thing for the US. It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him."
hyQm6oJB6MJ,17097,Anne Applebaum,"They are moving, but I was told at the current rate, they will take all of Donbas in something like four and a half years. Donbas is a tiny part of, well, it's a large part, but it's still pretty far Eastern Ukraine. So the Ukrainians continue to hold the line. They continue to innovate. They're building new drones. I've just seen some photographs actually of a new type of drone they've built that seems to be modeled on an Israeli model. They're now building their own missiles. I think another piece of the story that's really not understood is the Ukrainian campaign inside Russia against Russian refineries. And just in the last few days, they've hit several very large ones. And these are refineries that affect the internal Russian market. And one of the effects has already been long lines at gas stations all across, particularly, the eastern and southern parts of Russia. So the story that we're usually told, which is Ukraine is about to be crushed by Russia, and that actually President Trump seems to believe, is not true and hasn't been true for, it's not quite three and a half years, but three and a quarter years so far. So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that."
bhQsIfvkU4m,17565,Anne Applebaum,"And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia? And we have analyzed this many times back and forth, and we've heard all the possible explanations, and none of them has ever really made any sense. I mean, none of it really adds up. As for Europeans, the first part of your question... So yes, Europe now-actually this has been true for a while, this has been true for more than a year-Europe in total gives more money to Ukraine than the United States does. And that's both money... Ukrainians now have their own industries. And so Europe funds a lot of the drone production, for example, inside Ukraine, or some of it takes place outside of Ukraine in neighboring countries. So, the European money, both producing weapons and giving them weapons, is now much larger than the US. Plus there's other kinds of economic support and so on. I think European, there was a kind of Czech-led project to collect ammunition from around the world, that's had an impact. And so there's no question that Europe is now the more important source of aid, military aid and economic aid for Ukraine than the United States."
BmNRhONTika,17068,Anne Applebaum,"So in that sense, again, I mean the Ukrainians are as depressed as you would imagine by the failure of the talks so far and dispirited by that. And I can't account for how that morale will eventually affect them. But the war continues not very much changed. And the Russians are not making a breakthrough and they've not achieved a victory. And so I think that's the first thing to say. I mean, I think the second thing to say is that, looked at from the point of view of the Ukrainians and indeed from the Poles and from Europe, all the events of the last couple of weeks that seemed so dramatic, the meeting of Trump and Putin in Alaska, the Europeans flying to Washington to meet Trump together with President Zelensky of Ukraine, all of it has had very little impact on the ground. And probably what it's doing is prolonging the war. So again, I have to be very careful how I say this because I too want these talks to succeed and I also want there to be a breakthrough. And I hope there are secret negotiations that I don't know about where something better is happening. But what we see from the outside, and indeed what the Europeans and the Ukrainians see, is simply President Putin stringing along Donald Trump."
rah-gGL2jFA,19959,Anne Applebaum,"It's just kind of a stain on our honor, but also a terrible signal to send to the Ukrainians and to the Europeans, and to the Russians for that matter. To be clear, if Putin were to go to any country that's a member of the International Criminal Court, which the United States is not, that country would be obligated to arrest him. And that includes every European country. So he can't visit Europe at all because he would be arrested upon landing. And the fact, as you say, that he appeared in the US, that American soldiers physically rolled out a red carpet for him, which I haven't seen them doing for Zelensky indeed, or President Macron, or anybody else. The fact that he was received with this expectation of an elaborate lunch and so on, which by the way, he didn't stick around for. The fact that he was apparently rude to the American president, for which he seems to have paid no price either. I mean, all that is, from the European point of view and really actually the international point of view, pretty extraordinary. And it has started once again all the questions and conversations about what does he have over Trump? Why is Trump a supplicant towards Putin? Why is the United States, which is a much larger, much more important, much wealthier, much more powerful country, why do we appear to be sucking up to Russia?"
U42BOJTEvS3,6734,Tim Snyder,"And that basically got laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay and they were going to fight. I didn't think they would do as well as they ended up doing. So here I'm going to join in your expectation. I want to start there somewhere else, which is why, I'm just going to pose it a different way, which is why didn't we take Ukraine seriously or to put it in the sharpest possible term, why was our expectation the same as Russia's expectation? Because both inside the Kremlin and inside the Beltway and inside the Beltway among both Republicans and Democrats, the expectation was Ukraine is going to fold in a few days. And why did we have that expectation? And I think that expectation arises from the deep fundamentals, the imponderabilia, the things that come before we even start talking about history or strategy or politics. I think that comes from a kind of very deep Russian subjective victory, which is Americans and most people in the West until 2022, somewhere deep down thought Russia's a real place and Ukraine is not a real place. And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to ""whatever, they're corrupt, it's a new nation who knows..?"" like something that we are willing to say out loud."
QFnuFtafNt0,6185,Tim Snyder,"I think that's an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, ""These guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,"" which of course fascists are. Fascists have the cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness. And in that way, Milošević really was... he was somebody who talked about both... he does the thing which Putin does now and which Trump does now, which is that you somehow are both always the victim and you're always the victor at the same time. Like everybody's always against you and somehow it always turns out well, and whatever you do is okay because you're always already the victim. But yeah, I don't think, in coming out of the '80s into the '90s, a lot of the people that the United States had backed during the Cold War would have been called, if we had not been backing them, fascists. And so that's one reason why we're not sensitive to it. But I think the main reason we're not sensitive to it actually is a lack of reflection about our own history. I think that's really where we... that's our real problem. It's not anybody else, the problem is us. Yeah. And certainly someone like me who'd been on the conservative side, I feel like I've personally learned a ton about... and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and everything."
TeUW0DWq0fi,6132,Tim Snyder,"Yeah. ""We're on the right side of civil rights and we've..."" yeah. If we fix it, it's all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately. But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is connected to the America First stuff. Lindbergh's... The reason why Lindbergh likes the Nazis is that he wants to have, and I'm paraphrasing him now, but he wants to have a fortress of white people that are going to hold back the black and brown people. His fantasy is that we have a technological advantage across the Atlantic and, together with the Germans, we can basically keep the brown and the black people out of our countries. That's it. And it's direct organic. And you see that direct organic connection too, the folks now who talk about America First or isolationism very often bleed into or are quite openly on the wrong side when it comes to race. And then just as a footnote, it helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don't get. And I think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time around."
UNwE8cZ6snd,6321,Tim Snyder,"That's their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus, we lose attention, we don't fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North Koreans and the Iranians. Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that's very explicitly in their mind, that if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia? Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this- No, no. ...forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own... We have bubbles within a bubble, but there's one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often... I just put it very bluntly. We often just don't recognize that there's a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it's right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people and say rah-rah when there's not a vote for Ukraine aid."
cDYzqjIjszq,6314,Tim Snyder,"He doesn't pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He's kind of a link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it's ultimately about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in Ukraine, there's so much bloodshed, is clarifying. It's because that is in fact what people like. It's not just that they're tolerating it, it's what they like. Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not literally necessarily '20s, '30s European fascism, but that's something... I don't know. I had the more conventional, I was an anti-communist. And then the Cold War ended and then we had various... I was on the interventionist side, liberal interventionists, conservative interventionists side, depending on the Balkans and Middle East. But I don't know, I somehow put that out my mind. You didn't because you studied, I think, that part of the world. So that's infinitely more than I had. But I think it's a real... that's not a happy revelation, but it's one that one should've of course known all along, I guess. Yeah. It's interesting that we dropped it in the US because the whole anti..."
hEN3so3OxYg,10537,Mark Esper,"Trump did not take those lessons as well. Look, in many ways, things we were recommending pushing back against proved to be true. I often wonder whether he looks back and says, ""Thank goodness they were pushing back on me."" The best example is Afghanistan. Trump was constantly pushing to get out of Afghanistan, withdraw our troops. And as I talk about in a later chapter of my book, in October of 2020, before the election, he's going out there publicly buttressed by his national security advisor saying, ""We need to get out by Christmas,"" two months away, 2 1/2 months away, which was logistically impossible to do unless you left everything there and just put soldiers on planes and left, and we cautioned against that. I wrote a classified memo at the end of October saying we shouldn't go below 4,500 troops unless the Taliban does this or that or this or that. I've said publicly that I thought we should have used military pressure to get them to abide by the agreement. If not, we could have returned forces. But anyway, so the bottom line is we talked him out of a rapid precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan only to see what, 7, 8, 9, 10 months later Biden do the exact same thing, a rapid withdrawal from Afghanistan."
F3AZu3IqoPm,10416,Mark Esper,"What's that? They held Ukraine, yeah. But the actual direct invasion of a UN member state with the kind of semi-genocidal way they've conducted the war, maybe not semi, it's pretty the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years, I think. Right? I mean, I feel it's pretty big I think. Don't you think February 24, 2022 will be like a real, genuine moment in world history? Yeah. Look, I think it crystallized again this notion of a new era of great power competition with Russia and China being the adversaries. And keep in mind, it was just a few weeks before the invasion that Putin and Xi Jinping, the president of China, stood side by side of all places in Beijing at the Olympics, and they issued their 5,000 word statement about their strategic partnership and alliance, and would just be a few weeks later when Russia would invade Ukraine with armored columns and mechanized troops. And it was almost like the Nazi invasion of Poland in 39. I mean, it was just kind of a blitz into Kiev. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians fought back bravely, courageously and competently and spoiled their plans. Good for them. And you all did, I think a fair amount, and maybe the [inaudible] administration had begun after 2014 to do some things too, to really build up Ukraine's military capability."
n0pzlQY1wWm,10659,Mark Esper,"It's a different footing, and it's sending a message. I mean, who else are they making that announcement about? It's clearly, North Korea is a threat to them, but they've been dealing with North Korea for decades. It's really about China and it's about China, Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese naval vessels in Japanese waters, in Japanese exclusive economic zones, sailing around the Senkakus, which I think the Japanese recognizes. And by the way, it's not just them who are saying fund Ukraine, it's Taiwan too is saying, because they recognize the common principle at stake here. And the common principle is this, if a big authoritarian neighbor invades a smaller democracy for the sole purpose of seizing that territory and incorporating it into their own domain, we need to fight for those principles or else the global order that we've known that's produced peace and prosperity for the last 75 plus years is going to wither away. And that's not the world we want to live in when we're living under Chinese values and Chinese interests. It'll be a far different world for our grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Or a world in which Putin could just invade a neighbor and slaughter people and then get away with it, keep a good chunk of the territory or all of it. Yeah."
zAmka3p744b,10195,Mark Esper,"He certainly hasn't shown much instinct to go back towards, let's say, the Mark Esper, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence view of the world, and more of an instinct to double down on America First, and it's different, whatever that means, but it's different iterations. Don't you think, like the allies especially? Well, I've said this before, I talk about it in my book, and I think it's apparent now. When you see the polling, there are a lot of Republicans who want to see Trump reelected because they recall more favorable times than what they're seeing today. The Trump Administration pursued policy objectives that were consistent with what a lot of former conservative Republicans would've pursued as well, a conservative court, deregulation, lowering of taxes, an aggressive foreign policy. Trump sought to rebuild the military and did so for the first two or three years, securing the border, things like that. The challenge was that too often he would go too far. Look, I completely agree that we should push the allies in Europe, and Asia, by the way, to spend more on defense, to do more. But you don't go so far as to threaten to undermine NATO or to pull out, things like that. So again, I think in many cases his instincts were right. There were accomplishments during that administration, but there were guard rails in place, guard rail number one being the prospect of reelection, and number two being the people he brought in around him."
8VKkqLencZS,11227,Mark Esper,"With Ukraine, he said he'd cut off funding, cut off support, and he would negotiate an agreement within 24 hours. Yeah, what is that? Which is fancy fool. The only person who could stop this war in 24 hours is Vladimir Putin. But he's also attacked NATO, said it's not a good deal for the United States and had made attempts during his first term to undermine the alliance. So look, I take him at face value for his view on those. He said similar things about our allies in Asia. So I think he would pursue those things in a second term because he's unbound by the need to kind of play to a reelection, because there will not be another term after that. And so then the other big question becomes, who does he put in his cabinet? Myself and Mike Pompeo and John Bolton would talk him out of these things or at times when it came to funding Ukraine, trying to talk him into providing funding for Ukraine. So a key part here is one him, but the opposite side of the coin are who are the people he brings around him at both the Departments of State, Defense and elsewhere, but also in the White House because the people there have a big influence on him as well."
J61Yx_zfSAN,7166,Aaron Friedberg,"And that I think would be the most likely outcome. And then that has ramifying effects on everything else if it happens. That last sentence is so important. I want to get to it in a second, but I just did a podcast with my colleague, Tim Miller, who made a very good point I hadn't quite focused on, which is we take so much for granted that Trump behaves the way he behaves. I mean, how astonishing is it that he's with the head of a government that's fighting, of a nation that's fighting for its life against the brutal aggressor? We've been with it for, on its side, as almost the whole world has been really, the whole civilized world. And there's not a sentence that I could see, I skimmed the transcript also, of sympathy for Ukraine, of solidarity, of, ""Look, we so admire what you and your citizens have been doing."" You could then say, if you wished, ""We may have to, I'm not sure we can get the maximum war aims that you hope for."" And sometimes he has to make compromises you don't want to make. But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think."
2cW7GfP6R7o,7345,Aaron Friedberg,"But the fact that it doesn't even occur to him that a US president, or in this case, a US presidential candidate, should say the most basic thing about another democracy fighting for its life is so revealing, I think. Yeah, and praising them for standing up for their freedom and fighting, even when, I mean, it could have been critical of the Biden administration saying that initially they didn't believe that Ukraine could defend itself, but of course, Trump himself had taken a similar view. Again, I haven't read the full transcript, but the bit that I saw that referred to the war and the consequences talked about all the buildings that had been knocked down. And he says something like, ""If they hadn't done this, these buildings would still be standing, then they'd be there for 2,000 years,"" or something like that. So yeah, I didn't see anything there. Praising Ukraine for its resolve, praising Ukrainian democracy for rallying its people to defend their own government and their own territory, sympathy for the losses. He talks about it as if, you know, these are two, I don't know, there are two parties negotiating over a real estate deal. There's no sense that there's one side that we are sympathetic to and align ourselves with, and another that we reject."
425U85hfj-e,7023,Aaron Friedberg,"That doesn't seem to have happened directly yet, but the problem has not gone away. And if past is prologue, we're going to see this problem grow and take different forms, but it isn't going to go away. There will continue to be terrorism, terrorist attacks on targets in the region and outside the region, conceivably. Yuck. Meanwhile, the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years is going ahead. It's not ceased or even diminished in intensity, really. Yes. And I gather the Russians are slowly, slowly making progress. Ukraine has conducted this counteroffensive, which continues into Russian territory. But there's no sign there of any kind of decisive outcome in either direction. I guess there was hope some time ago that the Ukrainian forces might be able to roll back the Russians. And I think, for the most part, people have given up on this thought, at least for the foreseeable future. So is this headed for some kind of a stalemate? What might break the stalemate? To what extent would the United States and others support Ukraine in taking action that could conceivably have that effect, even at the risk of escalation with Russia? So that's by no means stable, but with no clear outcome in sight, either. I suppose in that case, and get to this in just a second, obviously, there are two policy choices in the U.S. one could seem like it could continue, but you could have us relaxing some of the limitations, lifting some of the limitations on Ukraine's use of weapons."
j4JkeiqoKRT,6974,Aaron Friedberg,"And she certainly has emerged as a more effective candidate than many people thought. And I think partly because of what she learned from where she was and what she observed, the things that she said on the Middle East, Russia, China, they've been, in my view, for the most part, the right thing to say. Are those now her genuine convictions and are they strong enough to enable her to push back against what I think is coming her way if she wins, which is we need to stabilize relations with China, we need to get a ceasefire because somehow we're going to get a peace settlement in the Middle East. Or I'm not sure exactly where that would come out on Ukraine. That we don't know, but I think the variance there is much narrower than the variance if it's Trump. And the downside, in my view, is much worse and more dramatic on the Trump side than it is on the Harris side. So if she wins, we'll be back to sort of normal debates about policy, foreign policy, defense policy, and I think we can survive that and live with that. If Trump wins, we're in a whole different world. In my view, it's likely to be a much darker one. Oh, that's good if somewhat bracing thing to end on."
dxTbI10q71H,7819,Aaron Friedberg,"That seems to me highly unlikely. He's expressed his views, his revisionist views about how he would like Russia to become the dominant power in Europe again. And the first piece of that would be weakening the American position and weakening the alliance that depends on the United States, namely NATO, and a defeat in Ukraine would have that effect. And I don't know where exactly that would lead, but it can't be anywhere good. So that's the first and most obvious set of consequences that seems to me would flow from a scenario in which the United States basically forces Ukraine to accept terms, which most likely would not hold for very long because the Russians would regroup and continue, and probably with the assurance that the United States wouldn't do anything. So that would be the first set of consequences. But then it echoes around the world. There are all these academic debates over years about whether dominoes really fall or whether a failure to follow up on commitments in one domain has an effect on others. I don't know. I haven't kept up with the literature. So it can go back and forth, back and forth. Usually academics like to say that, ""Oh, there's no connection between these things."" But that too seems to me highly unlikely."
7gvVOUnNDnw,9282,Robert Kagan,"Maybe they're resentful, but they're not this bottom up 1890s farmers in the Midwest who don't understand the gold standard and think it's bad for them, which it could well have been incidentally, and want leveling economic policies. Right? Right. And the one thing that... Trump is able to amass a pretty broad coalition precisely because his policies have nothing to do with economics. So he's not threatening, for instance, to take money away from rich people, or even very well-to-do people in general, and give it to a working class movement. He doesn't really offer any economic answer to those in the working class. What he offers to them is revenge. What he offers to them is sympathy and support for what is effectively white anxiety. And whenever you say, ""It's the working class that supports Trump."" It's the white working class that supports Trump. The non-white working class does not support Trump, overwhelmingly in the other direction. And so I just think intellectuals in America are heavily influenced by economic and ultimately Marxist interpretations of how society works. And the other thing is, of course people want to blame whatever bad thing is happening on the thing that they're always unhappy about. So people who are unhappy about inequality in America say, ""Well, this is because of inequality."" People who are unhappy with the Iraq war say, ""This is happening because of the Iraq war."" So there's a real tendency to do that."
yZJfNmPFs2v,8587,Robert Kagan,"Right, right. The Democratic Party could not repudiate the Klan. And so all that's happening, and Americans are capable of living in a society where that kind of prejudice is rampant. And I think that we just think that we grew out of it. And I think this is where we just can't imagine that people are still like that. And I think that to me, that's the big problem that we face intellectually, which is liberals, and I think we are all product of the Enlightenment to some extent, and we have this idea of inevitable progress. And we have this idea that human beings, over time... this is sort of the Frank Fukuyama thesis, which, Frank is hardly alone in feeling this way, that over time people will understand what liberalism requires. They'll become liberal. They'll realize that their prejudices are misplaced, et cetera, et cetera. I think the reality is different. I think the reality is that very few people really changed their mind that much. And there are always groups that feel the way that people who supported the Klan did, but they're oppressed or repressed or suppressed in various different ways. By Civil War, by... Eisenhower had to send the troops to Little Rock. The south was in full rebellion after Brown v. Board of Education, 1954."
IrB1-N3u6T3,8971,Robert Kagan,"They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments. They're in sheriff's offices and all kinds of things. And then you combine that with the pardon power, that's pretty far down the road, isn't it, away from liberalism? I mean, it's sort of like the definition of not being liberal, is cops can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be and vigilantes can do whatever they want at the beck of the powers that be, or some powers that want to be. It doesn't even have to be the powers that are quite in power yet. Right. Trump is going to play on the fact that even in the center of American politics, people are anxious about crime, although I think the statistics don't bear it out, but nevertheless, it's clear that if you're a Democrat in a city these days, you have to be tough on crime. So when Trump comes in and wants to be tough on crime, he is hardly going to be swimming against the tide."
Wi973ipfLj5,9386,Robert Kagan,"His first and really only issue in 2011 was the birther conspiracy. And when he comes out on the birther conspiracy, everybody knows what that means, especially the white nationalists in the country. So he summoned them to him immediately, and then he displayed all the characteristics that such demagogues have always displayed, including his crudeness and... He is a violator of all the norms, and it is precisely because of his violation of all the norms that he has this following because they see him as the one person who really is willing to defy the sort of liberal hegemony that has grown up in America, that he has the strength, the determination, he doesn't care what all these guys think about him, and he will fight this fight. But what is the fight? The fight is against American liberalism writ large. Yeah, that's good. I mean, the use of extra-legal forces and threats and even some terror, that's not... I mean, these are not the historians I've read much of, but I think labor historians would say that that's happened quite a lot on the management side in the late 19th century, and it wasn't a trivial part of the attempt to keep unions and working men under control. And then as God knows, there's a lot of ethnic violence and so forth."
f7wrD_pX-bt,8648,Robert Kagan,"He's made it very clear. I really don't understand. Too many people do not seem to understand that if Trump wins, there was going to be a bigger target on their backs than they are used to in this America. And from official forces, maybe either federal or tolerated forces at the state and local level with sympathetic governors or mayors obviously, but also the vigilante forces. I mean, you mentioned people not being punished. That's a part of American history obviously, and the kind of collusion you might say of the vigilantes and the law enforcement and official forces. Absolutely. I'm very struck with people have not made enough. I think Amanda Carpenter, who used to be with us at The Bulwark and is now at Protect Democracy, has made this point. Trump says in every speech that he's against qualified immunity for police officers, which I think a lot of people think actually is too much immunity, honestly, in terms of holding them accountable, but whatever. And he's for absolute immunity as he is for himself as president, for police officers, basically. They're not going to be charged with anything. He also says he's going to use the pardon power for the January 6th insurrectionists, but presumably many, many others as well. You combine total immunity for what you're doing if you're a law enforcement official, and we have hundreds of thousands in this country, and they're not all organized in terribly well-regulated police departments."
BYKe0-e8-5C,10493,James Carville,"And when you watch him, that rally in Georgia I think is significant because he didn't fill it up and he blamed Georgia State- a well-known liberal, coastal, elite institution. But the people were walking out and his reaction is, ""I got to keep them. I'll just get crazier."" And so he's like Brian Kemp. Okay, who's you know, Brian Kemp is Karl Rove's kind of wet dream of what a modern Republican should be. And he's just like savaging the guy. You could see he's trying to do anything he can to keep the crowd and keep them on their feet and keep them motivated. And like I say, he's an old comedian. Punchlines just don't work like they used to and he's just struggling. And do you think it'd be hard for him to regain his balance? I mean, it's hard to know, right? All I can say is we need to do everything we can to keep him off his balance, not predict if he can get his balance back. And I think the debates are golden opportunities because he doesn't want to do it. He does not want do it. He's got too much at risk. It's a multiracial female that he's got to go against and Vance is going to have to debate Walz and Walz is going to..."
Llczfnv8s2q,9983,James Carville,"It goes back to the original point. She's not really that well known. And the first person to grab a paintbrush and start painting is going to be the memory. And we have a shot because it could be hard for them to break through. Are you surprised? I think the relative failure of the Trump campaign to define her negatively over these first two weeks... I mean, I kind of expected them to really come out of the box with stuff on her that from 2019, if only those, what she said then to really dump a lot of... spend a lot of money in the swing states. But maybe she's just had so much momentum that it didn't penetrate. She's had a very good two weeks. But do you agree that the Trump campaign's had a not very good two weeks? This is why The Bulwark exists. Something is going on at Mar a Lago, I'm not sure what it is. That Black journalist thing? Some people actually think that was planned, but this guy, LaCivita, Susie Wiles, they're not stupid. I mean, they've won elections before. And what's coming out of there is... you're right, they don't know where to go. They let it get away from them. It was like they got hit in the... And they were totally..."
t6ingdPYoPX,10116,James Carville,"But this is more... You can't use a historical benchmark to talk about this because debates have now taken on near legendary status in American politics. Yep. Speaking of historical benchmarks, so I mean, on the one hand, we've never seen an election like this in all kinds of ways, particularly Biden getting out. I was thinking about this the other day, and this is not a criticism, I think it's the first ticket in modern times since the modern primary system came into being where both candidates on one ticket, in this case on the Democratic ticket, and neither of them has ever gotten a vote in a Democratic primary for president, that is every race we've all been involved in or watched... In the early days, they only had a few primaries, Humphrey and all that. But still every nominee in both parties had gotten some primary votes, certainly from '72 on. '76 on, let's just say. And mostly had won the primaries. And then the VP nominees had often run and gotten at least some primary votes, especially if they were the losing candidate. Or Gore had run in '88 and then was picked in '92. So it just accentuates, I think, what uncharted waters we're in. I mean, we don't have... Why don't you...? You should make a list."
Yb9jkMYlduW,9951,James Carville,"God, you really don't feel any better than you would if you never had the infected wisdom tooth, but you do feel better now it's gone, just as an example. But I think that people wanted to like her. They were so glad to have a relief and they came in with disposition. And to her credit, just literally everything she's done since... Was it three weeks now? Seems like 300 years? No, I think just two and a half, maybe. Two- It was on a Sunday, [inaudible]. Two weeks and two days, yeah. We're talking Tuesday the 6th, I think. So far, she has done nothing to dampen people's enthusiasm, she hasn't done anything remotely dumb, so I have reason to actually be encouraged. She looks like she's really grown, and people would tell me that. That's one thing I will say is people internally would say, ""James, she's different. She's more confident,"" and not just White House staff people, people that would go in there. Economists, historians, the same people go in and out of the White House. It doesn't matter who's in there. To a person that would all say she's very confident and asks very good questions and seems to be well briefed. I'm happy that she's like this. I'm not totally surprised. You think that there's reasonable hope that that lasts?"

You should make a list. People that listen to this, make a list of all of this, ""First time this happened in the 2024 election."" First time somebody dropped out, first time they had a debate in June. So something tells me we're going to see a lot more first here. We're not done with first. We should have a running list of, ""First time..."" Blank. And it was the first... Very obvious, first time a woman's been ahead of a ticket or first time... I hate the term, woman of color, but that's okay. You're non... I don't have an objection to it. I just think it's such progressive arrogance to assume that everybody who is not white is the same. Right. That's why it drives me crazy. But anyway, whatever, first non-Caucasian to ever be at the top of the ticket, first to never get a single primary vote. That's one of my favorite arguments that I got. I get this a lot. I like to do kind of right-wing media, unlike most people because it keeps me... It's good when you...

4rXGg9OIz-J,11088,James Carville,"But the question, can it have an effect? The answer is yes, if he's acquitted or even a hung jury, that will excite his people and it will demoralize a lot of Democrats. How much, don't know. An acquittal would be very good for him and would really demoralize them. Now, the lawyers say there's not going to be an acquittal. I don't know, but if there's a guilty verdict, remember juries are supreme. And what that juror, that foreman, whoever goes out and speaks for the jury says is going to have a lot of say. You can say, ""Well, it's a Manhattan jury."" Well, it's a Manhattan jury, Manhattan, Kansas, Manhattan, New York, they're all people. And they all sat there, you know, we sat for six weeks. We listened to 28 hours testimony. We went through every charge. We waited. That matters to people. And so, people say, well, the hardcore Trump people, probably not going to affect the hardcore. But as we talked about earlier, he can't win with just MAGA. And so, a lot of people that you know that even I know some, they don't want to vote for a Democrat. They're very uncomfortable with Trump, but they don't know, this will keep them away. They'll either vote for Biden or not vote. You just can't look at the Trump vote as hardcore MAGA because we know that's not enough."
GTTmKfP1cw5,10369,James Carville,"They have to be very, very careful how he's deployed and they have to husband him pretty closely. And I can't fault them for that, but yes sir, how are you going to address him? Yeah, that's a good point. But in the meantime, you can use paid media and stuff to really remind people. But the big thing is going to be the jury. If there's a conviction, how those jurors come across is going to have a lot to how much people accept this verdict. Yeah, that's interesting. And if Trump loses it, which he might and attacks the jury, I feel like that's an opportunity also to say he's attacking these Americans who are doing their duty. Right? Right. If these jurors, what I'd give to prepare one of them for Sunday morning TV. First of all, collectively, this jury took 21,250 hours out of their lives. We listened to X... 28,000 words of testimony. We sat there and observed every witness. We conscientiously went through every document, and we could arrive at no other conclusion but this. Boom. Boom. And who the jury is, who they elect foreman, how articulate she or he is. Yeah, it all depends a lot, but how that jury justifies what they did can have a lot of effect on public opinion, and we never really considered politics in this, to be honest with you."
4m2nHMabhKU,10672,James Carville,"We had terrible disaster in Lebanon and the fall of '83 with the Marines being killed. But one got the sense... I mean, he acknowledged it and then he pivoted very quickly. And I'm not using that as an example. And Reagan, of course, everyone cites, is too much. He's too high a standard, I suppose, on a political scale, but it feels like they could be more decisive, whichever course he chooses to take. Or even if he chooses to change course. Yeah, I remember '83, the [inaudible] you know? I actually think he was too willing to move on. I think some people really screwed that up. I agree totally. Yeah. But he got beyond it. That's undeniable. But there was some... look, there's no more massive act of negligence on a part of any nation since World War II than there was about Israeli government on October 7th. That's just staggeringly... and so much of that was a result of hubris, of thinking we had everything under control, it was all done. And boy, when you look back at how arrogant they were, you could see how something like this would happen. And... what really bothers me, is just how does this thing end? I mean, maybe you've talked to a lot more people in foreign policy than I do, but what is Gaza going to be like five years from now other than a place where journalists are going to come and see what a pathetic wretched life they have?"
eWJUA058lEd,10628,James Carville,"I am struck how much people just assume it's going to happen because Trump said he would do it. I assume Trump won't do it if he thinks it not in his interest. He said he was going to testify to trial. [Inaudible] he thought that. And you know what? When he didn't testify, it didn't cost him anything. There was very little... even, ""well sir, you said..."" so he'll say... he's already said, ""CNN can't host, they're not fair."" He's just going to brush it off and say, ""It can't be fair. I told Biden to take a drug test. He wouldn't take a drug test."" My answer would be, ""Will you give us the records that Keith Schiller stole from Dr. Bornstein in 2017 that no one's ever asked you about it? You went in his office, the doctor said he felt like he was raped, sent your goons in there and be glad to, you release those health records."" But he doesn't pay. He's paid zero price for not testifying his own path. None. And from that, he's learned, I can do what I want. I can back out of a debate. What are they going to do to me? I mean, do you think though that Biden literally every day for the next month just says, in the course of discussing whatever issue he's discussing, ""I very much look forward to debating Donald Trump on this."
kk6JdhZ2OcT,9906,James Carville,"I think Trump does not think it hurts him to have two males on the ticket. I think everyone thinks he's going to pick a woman or a minority, but I don't know that he... I think he has a sort of view which is pretty cynical, and we may not like it, but that two older white rich guys, that's kind of attractive to Republicans, and it's not that unattractive to a certain type of swing voter who thinks, well, those guys know what they're doing. They're business guys, they're et cetera. Tough guys. He seems pretty intent that he's going to do it his way. He's telling you, ""We're not going to have any of this General Kelly, Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn. We're not going through that anymore."" He's really laying the groundwork to say, ""I ran on this. I told you I was going to do this. Now I'm going to do it."" And I could see somebody saying, ""Well, if you pick another white male, you're going to get a lot of flack."" And he said, ""That's exactly the kind of flack I want."" That may be just what he wants to do. And I'm not doing it like you tell me to do it. I'm doing it my own way. And by the way, he'll have a point if he wins."
Vnk4P7mzi_4,3726,Eric Edelman,"He really believes in transactionalism as a way of life. And in that sense, this Qatari luxury aircraft is not just a symbol of Trumpism, it's really the substance of Trumpism. No, that's very well said. And it is kind of amazing when you read, Times especially the article, it's not even clear there's like an official document. It's sort of, that's also, I suppose, the kind of transactionalism Trump likes, right? Pretty vague about exactly what's promised to whom, a lot of ability to rethink things later on. Maybe he will use the plane as a private citizen after he becomes president. He'll cross that bridge when he gets to it. The whole thing has that ring to it. I was amused also, I'll just say, by the fact that it seems to be something they've been trying to dump for four years. No one wanted to buy it. It's both expensive and extremely, I guess, expensive to operate. God know what the expense will be for us to transform it into an actual functioning Air Force One with all the security and other considerations that that involves. But anyway, I think you're right. Yeah, that is the shakedown side. Well, say a word more about that though. Why would the Qatari, why would they be so eager to have Trump's backing or Trump's goodwill?"
KF3pgDLdCiF,3722,Eric Edelman,"Neither of those things happened. It's not clear that the president on his own can actually lift all of these sanctions. Some of them are imposed by legislation. Others, like taking Syria off the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, the so-called FTO, requires him to submit a report to Congress, which they then have to approve. So to say the least, there were a lot of T's that were left uncrossed and I's that were left undotted in all of this. Now, in the meeting with al-Sharaa, the president did ask, according to the readout from the White House, for some of the things we would want from a new Syria. One of which was, for instance, normalization with Israel, have Syria join the Abraham Accords and become another neighbor of Israel that has made peace with it, it would be like Egypt and Jordan and the UAE, Bahrain, other states surrounding Israel in the region. That would be a good thing. He asked for al-Sharaa to expel some of the foreign jihadis who helped al-Sharaa come to power, but who have since been engaged in intercommunal violence in Syria that has troubled observers who would like to see a stable Syria. He asked for their assistance in integrating the Kurdish militias with which we fought ISIS during the Obama and Trump and Biden administrations, to reintegrate them into the Syrian Armed Forces, and also to take over oversight of the camps that contain some 30,000 ISIS fighters and family members that potentially dangerous folks who, if left untended, could lead to a recurrence of ISIS terrorism in Syria."
W84jX3-L8s0,4336,Eric Edelman,"I mean, his losses have been extraordinary and the rate of advance has been really very slow. I mean, they've been advancing but at a snail's pace and mostly dismounted infantry assaults, very hard for them to make up their losses in equipment and much less in personnel. They have lost, according to British MOD intelligence numbers that were posted earlier this month, something like 967,000 people, of whom about 200,000 have died, been killed in action. They will probably hit the million-casualty mark sometime this month or early June. Those numbers are astronomical and they're not really sustainable. If Putin has to calculate that he is pursuing this with continued US support, continued European support, maybe stepped-up European support, that's one thing. But if he's able to- For Ukraine. For Ukraine, yeah. But if he's got to calculate that it's going to be US supports going away, European support is kind of iffy, then he's going to be stepping up his operations and think he can drive Ukraine ultimately to capitulate, which seems to be his objective. And that I think would be catastrophic not just for Ukraine, but for European security and for NATO and for US leadership in the world. And by the way, the Chinese will be watching. But yes, to your point, I mean this is not a coherent kind of worldview and it's not sustained by any kind of deliberative process."
qpNUq0_kzE6,3842,Eric Edelman,"But he knew that going to the Middle East, where he had gone on his first trip in his first term, he would be greeted with sword dances and with, as you say, camels and Arabian stallions and red Cybertrucks and fighter escort for Air Force One and all of the trappings of power that he enjoys and the kind of adulation he requires psychologically, I think, in order to operate at a high functional level. So it was, from that point of view, a great place to start his foreign travels as president. Technically, actually.... Technically though, I think we have to note his first trip was actually to the funeral of Pope Francis. Oh. You're right, good point. Yeah, I missed that. I didn't think of that. So he went to three countries. Frankly, for a lot of Americans, and I'll put myself in that category, they slightly blur together since they're all next to each other and they're all similar backgrounds, you might say, but still very different actually in terms of their foreign policies and what happened in each of those countries. And I guess the order was Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE- United Arab Emirates. But since the headline of the trip became the plane, maybe we should begin with the famous, or infamous, Qatari 747."
LogpOzA70GY,3769,Eric Edelman,"The meeting was in Riyadh on the day that he left Saudi Arabia. It was that morning when he went on to Doha and he met with Farouk al-Sharaa, the new president, interim president, of Syria who came to power in December. That was actually important, but it was preceded by a statement he made the day before that he was going to end all sanctions on Syria. We had put in place an enormous number of sanctions on individuals and entities in Syria as a result of the very destructive 15 year long Syrian Civil War, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, created a massive outflow of refugees from Syria and internally displaced people in Syria. And this was done, the president said quite openly, essentially at the behest of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, and President Erdoğan of Turkey, both of whom have an understandable desire to see Syria stabilized after 15 years of violence that have wracked the country and disrupted the region. That's all understandable. And there is an argument that sanctions on Syria should be lifted, or at least some sanctions should be lifted. The question though is, first of all, this was done without any kind of deliberative policy process at all. In fact, the administration's counter-terrorism coordinator and Deputy National Security Advisor, Seb Gorka, just on the end of the day before the president left, was fulminating about, ""We're not going to lift sanctions on this jihadi president of Syria."" And there is a question about al-Sharaa because he does have a past link to jihad."
4GaiQk4-PDe,8302,AB Stoddard,"He wants people to go into red areas. He worked construction, he served in the military. He knows what it's like to struggle to find healthcare coverage, to get a job where that would be provided. He basically, he says, you can't go to Walmart and buy a Carhartt jacket, a Carhartt boots, and show up at an event and try to talk to working class people and win them back from Trump. You have to be authentic. I've seen him repeat this message. I mean, this is somebody who's making an effort not only to get the message across to Democrats, but to become a voice for the Democrats. And so I think that kind of thing will spread. People have to take chances and they have to get out there. And Jasmine Crockett went viral on the oversight committee before Trump was reelected. So now she's running around trying to be a voice, and she made a mistake recently. So people are getting worried about that. People are worried also about having AOC and Bernie before facing because they're too liberal. That's all fine. But I think if you get out there and you carpet bomb in the face of the assault on our system that we're facing, something will stick. And that's why I think the idea of having some kind of rotating voices on a unified message, like my whiteboard idea is that you can get a mother who is affected in a measles outbreak one week and the next a senator."
UnB0LcO7PT_,7917,AB Stoddard,"And watching Bill Cassidy, a serious man, senator from Louisiana, a doctor, struggle with that vote, knowing that RFK Jr has really promoted quack science and conspiracies for a long time. That he's anti-vaccine... Bill Cassidy's on the fence... was really, you could really see him turning himself into a pretzel and he ends up supporting him and now is going to call him before his committee to talk about all the firings and he's upset and concerned. That was all predictable. RFK Junior is a really troubled guy and really an unstable person who also just spews falsehoods. And so this was not something to take a chance on. All of this was predictable, and it's really quite enraging. Jonathan Rauch, who's a very well-known writer and will be known to people who listen to this, famously posted around 10 days ago that he had a friend who drove two hours for her breast cancer chemotherapy treatments that were part of an NIH trial only to arrive at the location to be told without any phone call or warning that it had been canceled. And there was no future plans for any new protocols or any new treatments for her. And this kind of thing is going to ripple out through people's lives, people who have kids with special needs, people who have diabetes, whatever it is."

People will care and that kind of thing will travel because Democrats are just looking, the voters are looking for some kind of response, some kind of a fight. So what I'm saying is I see a pickup between January 20 and April two. It's not good enough, but I see something is building in terms of people being willing to get out there. And of course they need resources, they need coordination. They need to stop fighting, they need to stop blaming, and I think they need to actually attack Trump's assault on five different subjects a day. I mean, they can't hide from any issue. And yeah, you can't jump at the news and that's what he wants you to do. And he throws out distracting things like Greenland and so you shouldn't follow that like a dog to the bone. But why can't they, I keep thinking, do a golden era or what does he called it? ""The golden age whiteboard,"" where they every day a different person, it's AOC one day, it's a businessman, small businessman from Kansas. The next week it's Mark Cuban. The week after that it's, I don't know somebody but maybe five numbers."

I mean, are we sufficiently appreciative of the fact that this lunatic is the secretary of HHS and is not, contrary to what people sort of thought, has not pulled back at all? And I mean, I'm a little freaked out about this. I have sort of secondary family relations, mostly on Susan's side, in medical and research science world. And I actually know some people in that world too from around here and New York, and I mean, this is bad, they think. And they're not hysterics. And incidentally, a lot of them have been critical of NIH... It's a bureaucracy, they don't always fund the right things. They have the usual gripes you have with big government agencies, but the degree of damage that's being done, and maybe voters don't understand if research on Parkinson's gets slowed down or eviscerated because you don't see the effect, exactly. You know what I mean? You don't see the progress that's not made. It's not like social security office being closed, but I really wonder how much that's going to percolate out through sort of Republican-ish voting groups, right? Physicians, executives and pharma companies."

What about the resistance to Trump? I agree, none of us... I bet you could Google a million articles about a Trump second term and never see the term ""law firms."" That was not on people's radar screen that he's also going to go punish them, try to damage their business, threaten them existentially, the Paul Weiss guy claimed, and also get tens of millions of dollars of pro bono work that's friendly to him. Universities maybe we expected that a little more, I suppose. The businesses, not big tech stuff, we've all just taken that for granted now, but that was a big deal when it happened right after the election and pretty... Zuckerberg, Bezos, pretty striking. I mean, maybe we'll get to the Democratic party itself, the more political side of things in a few minutes, but what have we learned about America in terms of the resistance? Well, yeah, we'll get to Democrats afterwards. I see sort of the population and then the institutions of law, of acting, yeah. That's a good distinction... And they're different. I feel that we've seen with the law firms always and others, a lot of hands in the air saying, we're trying to protect our business."

The FTC just issued a report on how the largest grocers were marking up prices allegedly because of cost, supply chain issues from the pandemic. It turns out that they're jacking it up way beyond what their costs increases were. They're fighting these fights, but not really highlighting them to the degree I would in a campaign like this. Bottom line, be more like Joe from Scranton and less like President Biden from Washington. Put yourself on the side- because those are the voters, Bill, who are going to decide this election; working class people, Black, white, and Hispanic, who are very much scuffling still in an economy that's improved, but in which cost of living has aggregated and continues to be an obstacle. It's just so hard when you're the incumbent president and incumbent president's team to get them not to defend their record. Let's put it this way, not to have them ... They want to spend 80% of their time defending their record and explaining why they're doing better than anyone realizes, and 20% of the time talking about what they still want to do in the second term and so forth. Of course, what you're saying, I think, is that it should be the other way, 80/20, but I saw this- I don't even.."

And there is so much out there, so many people out there saying, ""Don't give Trump a platform, don't let Trump..."" I have the opposite view, which is I think more of Trump is better out there, because I do think people need to be exposed to... He's crazier now than he was in 2016, and even 2020, although it's hard to compete with telling people to drink or inject bleach to fight... But he's kind of scary crazy, and people need to understand the choice. I can't stand this notion that if we censor him, it'll all be okay. That's not the case. And I think he's profited, actually... I was relieved when he got taken off Twitter, because it was a migraine headache every day and it was provocative. But now, he's micro channeling, to his base, stuff that if most people saw, they would just... All that said, Bill, that's just an aside, I'm just venting at your expense here. All that said, I don't think, at the end of the day, that the campaign should be based on all of that."

He's good. Listen, no one should underestimate Donald Trump. That's always been my keep. He's a feral genius- Yeah. ...that is very, very clear. And even the stuff that we're all... I'm appalled that he put a target on the judge's daughter's back over the weekend and published her photograph, because there are crazy people out there. I'm worried about another Paul Pelosi situation- Yeah. ...where someone is motivated by all of this. That said, what he's doing is he is doing what he always does. He knows that he is at risk of being convicted in this trial in New York, and he's branding it. He's branding the whole event as a partisan, as he would call it, witch hunt and so on, and he's just going to do that relentlessly, just as he did by the way he branded the 2020 election in advance. Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months."
cYgRMFn4EuQ,4494,David Axelrod,"I don't know whether it's because he's confined. I posited on Hacks On Tap that he's jealous that Christ gets all this attention. I don't know.

I saw some guy in a focus group say, he was a guy who voted for Trump before, but said he couldn't again, and he said, ""Trump as president is like having a neighbor who runs a jackhammer 24 hours a day,"" he says, ""Just exhausting."" And so, I think there's some element of that that will erode some of these gauzy memories. But I think the Biden campaign has to remind people, and you and I, we may have a difference of opinion on this particular piece of policy, but the one signature achievement of the Trump administration was a $1.7 trillion tax cut that primarily favored corporations and wealthy people. Right. It is the single most negative thing, up there with abortion rights, but it is more broadly impactful. And you talk about that, his inaction on pharmaceutical prices, a whole range of issues on which, on economics, he's just in the wrong place. And if there is a presumption that goes to Joe Biden for having some sense of the way real people, or average people, live..."
Llp1WZQuiVg,4062,David Axelrod,"Right. He said in advance, ""If we lose, it will have been stolen."" It wasn't something that he thought of that night. He worked on that project for months. This is what Donald Trump does, and you need to be alert to it. I do think we do have to call him out on these... These are strategies. This isn't just expressions of outrage on his part, they're strategies, and we need to call them out for what they are. Well, yeah, I've very much thought that, therefore, I don't really like the, ""He's popping off again, it's all instinct with him and anger."" And there's, of course, a lot of that, God knows, but yeah, there are these branding strategies, he's been doing that for 50 years, marketing- Yes. ...and he's unfortunately good at it. I said to someone the other day, I was critical of the Biden campaign, but I was sympathetic, I said, ""It's tough to run against Trump, he's a tough opponent. He's, in his own crazy way, a very skilled politician of a certain type."" And the person looked at me like I was just crazy. ""Trump is not skilled at anything. Trump is a lunatic. Trump is crazy. He can't control himself. He says one stupid thing after another."" But I think that's a mistake among Liberals and Democrats."
O7JScyuLyBh,4302,Doug Sosnik,"I think it's true for Republicans, I know it's true for Democrats, which the last time that the convention served that purpose of nominating someone based on who's on the convention floor was '68. Yeah, that's an unfortunate memory for Democrats. Yeah, and so that was such a disastrous- But let me make this, can I just- So I read this little piece, and I said, it's funny that the convention was in Chicago, because you know what? The convention was in Chicago, Roosevelt in 1932, and I believe Roosevelt was nominated on the third ballot, and it was a very much of a weeding out of candidates, some of whom... They weren't really primaries then, but who were favorite sons and so forth. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago at 1860 on the fourth ballot, so maybe multi-ballot conventions in Chicago were good. Then [inaudible] 19,000 people wrote in and said, ""Are you kidding? What about '68?"" But I would make this point about '68, just not to obsess too much on the replacing Biden thing. It was a horrible mass. Robert Kennedy was tragically assassinated, McCarthy, Humphrey, the violence in Chicago, Dick Daley, the whole nightmare, right? Still, at the end of the day, Humphrey almost won in '68, and I believe Humphrey would've ran better in '68 than Lyndon Johnson would have..."
P6vhwvNd8Dp,4219,Doug Sosnik,"They couldn't stop him from going, the staff couldn't persuade him not to go out Thursday night when he was angry about the Robert Herr Special Counsel report. And that was not great. And then he chose not to do the Super Bowl interview. And again, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, obviously in the big picture, no one's going to remember Super Bowl interview in 2024, but I don't know if that's sustainable for eight, nine months. Trump isn't exactly Mr. Accessibility either in certain ways, but you do get... He's good at giving the impression that he's doing a lot of things and he does friendly interviews a lot at least, and therefore people kind of feel like he's on top of things. Well, first of all, Trump was way more accessible to the press and not just the right-wing press compared to Biden. So let me just say this quickly on the interview. These interviews have become staples of Super Bowl Sunday. They have changed over time and have become less soft interviews and harder interviews and more aggressive interviews. So that's changed. They had over 10 million people watch Trump when he was interviewed by Hannity before the Super Bowl a few years ago. So that's a lot of eyeballs. And remember that, and this may be one of the reasons by the way, the Biden people didn't want to do it, that while 10 million people may have seen the Trump interview, there were probably four or five times that who saw a report on the interview without having seen the interview."
cI7m0ORFEm_,3997,Doug Sosnik,"And so for completely different reasons. I think they're obviously in a much stronger position within their own parties now than they were back in June. What's different, and it is different, is the race, I would say from the beginning of last year until around the middle to end of October, was pretty static. And it had Biden ahead of Trump, both nationally and in the battleground states. It was consistent. It wasn't an overwhelming lead, but it was a lead of 2, 3, 4 points pretty much consistently. The polls never changed. Over the last three and a half, four months, the race has changed. And it started, I would say around the end of October with a series of polls that came out. There was a six-state battleground New York Times poll, which had Trump ahead in all six battleground states. And pretty significantly, the NBC poll that came out in early November had Trump ahead for the first time in their polling. And their Wall Street Journal poll came out in November, which not only showed the same Trump advantage, but they asked a series of questions which haven't changed in the last three and a half months, which compared voters' views of what life was like when Trump was president compared to what life is like with Biden as president."
OMeRx6v1T1M,4108,Doug Sosnik,"What really, really concerned me, I remember was sometime in that spring of '95 when I was walking through an airport and Clinton was on television and no one was watching him. And that really struck me, that struck fear with me. And I do worry a little bit that at some point the public is going to shut down on Biden in terms of giving him another look. And he's got two related but different challenges right now. One is to inspire and motivate his base to not only support them, but to turn out. And it's far from a given that that's going to happen. And then the other of course is with the swing voters in the handful of states that'll determine the next president if it's a close election, his numbers with the swing voters are lagging his overall numbers, which are quite bad. The kicker view in your New York Times piece was that disqualifying Trump might not be enough or likely wouldn't be enough. You can't just do that. I think Democrats have really been counting on that to a considerable degree. Explain that a bit. I think they have that a think people who forget that or discount that I don't think have either thought about or interpreted properly. One of the lessons of the 2016 campaign in which Hillary Clinton's campaign was almost entirely predicated on an anti-Trump message."
-0jEvb44euM,4102,Doug Sosnik,"Well, I'll respond everything you say. Let me just take your last question first. Let's assume nothing changes and then I'll talk about if something does change. All right. But assuming nothing changes, the bar that Biden's going to have to clear at the convention is one of reassurance and that he's up to it. He's not going to be exciting. He doesn't need to be exciting, but he does need to reassure. But going back to the land of what would happen if something happened for a moment, the big point about '68, though, and what happened after was, they changed the rules and made the role of convention delegates much different than they used to be. They actually used to pick nominees at conventions. And back to your point on Humphrey, I think if he'd broken with Johnson in July instead of October and Vietnam, he probably would've won. But let's just take two scenarios for a moment of something happens to Trump or something happens to Biden. If something happens to Trump and you go to a convention, the party of Trump is the party of Trump. So those delegates on that floor are completely MAGA Republicans. In addition, of course, to the fact that despite the fact there's still a primary for the Republican nomination and 90% of the delegates haven't been picked, Trump has already taken over the RNC."
SIQjpwl63MO,8824,A.B. Stoddard,"So that's what I was expecting. I was expecting a big Republican margin that was going to buffer them, and let the crazies rule. So it's a challenge for the Democrats to respond to that, and they need to get their head around the fact that McCarthy has landed in a good spot right now. At least tactically. No, that's such an important point. And we'll close with that. I do feel like the Democrats haven't done a very good job of taking all these mini-scandals and embarrassments, George Santos and stuff, they haven't really wrapped it around the Republican's neck. So it's sort of well, Santos is a bizarre story, and here's the latest detail of that. But no one thinks, I don't know, that somehow, shouldn't the speaker do something about that? Or shouldn't his colleagues do something? And that's been true of Gosar and others. And so the Democrats are not very good at sort of attaching the worst things any one Republican member does to the whole conference. And McCarthy has done a decent job of getting Marjorie Taylor Green and Gaetz and all to speak up less. I guess maybe the speaker vote thing, which was sort of an short-term embarrassment to McCarthy was kind of also a wake-up call for all the others that we can't go through, it would hurt them all if everything just broke."
b35d0r6z1Mo,9016,A.B. Stoddard,"All they'd have to do is say you have to pledge to support the nominee and they won't hold Trump to [inaudible] but of course they would hold Liz to it. But they're not going to hold Trump to it. Right, of course not. He's not going to pledge to support any nominee except for him. Will he debate, do you think? What do you think? I don't think he will. Interesting. Because it's just a set-up for failure. He could go in and start screaming at everybody and saying crazy things and dominate, and he likes that, I think he enjoys the actual fight, but I think he knows, he's telling people privately, I'm too far ahead, he knows that the most likely outcome is he loses his lead a little bit and so what's the point? And they can all stand the stage and say he's afraid and he'll be like, ""They're afraid."" Yeah, it draws him down to their level if you're the front-runner in your debate, whereas he's done a town hall, he's not scared of anything. This is where that CNN Town Hall let's just do a final before we get to President Biden, who's important. This is, of course, typical of the Biden years, you spend the first half hour of the conversation on Trump, Right."
2ogvT8ILKL3,8402,A.B. Stoddard,"And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day. So he's been rewarded by the primary electorate and the fact that his rivals cannot bring themselves to criticize any of that. Do you think DeSantis... Two questions. He launches in 10 days or so, does he start criticizing Trump more directly either because he can't win or because he wouldn't actually be as good a president as he DeSantis would be? And also it seems like DeSantis's strategy is focus on Iowa and New Hampshire, if you win both of those, you're probably the nominee, if you win one of them, you have shot at being the nominee, and that's how an underdog typically gets to at least parody with a front-runner, you win Iowa, Obama won Iowa and so forth, McCain won New Hampshire in 2000. McCain fell short, Obama won the nomination, but in each case that's how they became the plausible alternative to the person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W."
MvQHqP0t2Gk,9283,A.B. Stoddard,"I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary? I guess not. It just makes me so sick. I wrote that for The Bulwark months ago. They're not allowed to say that he didn't win the election. Chris Sununu says that, Chris Christie says that. Mike Pence says things like, ""I didn't do what he wanted me to do because I didn't have the constitutional authority to on January 6th,"" and will always disagree, but he doesn't like to come out and say, ""We lost the election."" He really avoids that. But you shouldn't incite mobs. It's the story of the Capitol. But they won't even, they will not even criticize January 6th. So not only will they not say he lost, they will not say he definitely tried to steal an election, he plotted a two-month coup, he incited a deadly a riot where people died. They won't touch January 6th. They won't touch his coup plotting. And so the message they're sending everybody is that it's okay. And Trump is absolutely giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he's gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million dollars, but people were laughing the very next day."
ntNbT9cNsvO,8705,A.B. Stoddard,"And you're right, now that he has gotten away with it all... And of course you're a better liar if you're totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you're a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new liberal friends are, ""well, he can't get away with this. This lie is even worse,"" but I think they underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it... The open mic night is a great line of Mike's, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn't that bad last time. Then you say, ""Well, the reason he wasn't that bad if he wasn't was because he had 19 different constraints, both individuals and institutional constraints that won't exist in a second term,"" but no one of course is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn't stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think? I don't know. January 6th incidentally, is anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary?"
yQKnwqQL2uC,6987,Tom Tugendhat,"But are you a little heartened? Are you worried, concerned? What heartens you? What concerns you, et cetera? Well, I mean on one level I'm heartened, there's been huge numbers of weapons deliveries to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves have expanded from, well, depending on how you count, some two, 300,000 people at arms to what's now, I mean, depending on who you ask, anywhere between 700,000 and a few million in various different ways. I mean, these numbers, for very obvious reasons of national security, the Ukrainians aren't advertising the figures, and of course it depends whether you count things like border forces and reserve battalions and how you count them and so on. But basically the Ukrainians have mobilized their entire nation very effectively. The weapon supplies are coming through from many allies, not all. There's a few notable exceptions that are pretty famous. And the Ukrainians are in a better position than they were when we spoke, whenever it was, eight, 10 weeks ago. The reality is they've just launched their counter offensive in Kherson, an area in the Southeast of the country. I tell you my thoughts and prayers are with their soldiers. I hope very much that they achieve the ends that they need. But the reality is this is a hard slog, and..."
unXbr-YcRTJ,7204,Tom Tugendhat,"And so I'm very sorry it has required the invasion, of the attack on Kyiv to do it, but I'm very glad that we've finally woken up. So I think that this is a huge change. Well, let's talk about that for a minute and get back to Ukraine itself and the situation on the ground, but that's important. I mean, how much of a mugging by reality has there been? Or are people understanding, though, coming grips with it? My father used the phrase, ""Neoconservatives and liberals who are mugged by reality."" And a friend of his said, ""Well, there's an awful lot of liberals around who,"" this was 30, 40 years ago, ""who sort of understand that they've been mugged by reality, but don't want to press charges."" Which I thought was a nice way of capturing a certain kind of, ""Well, yeah, Putin's worst than we thought. Who thought he would do this? I predicted he wouldn't, ugh. But on the other hand, we can't really go crazy and we have to work with him and energy and other things. And it's a big country, and China's more of a threat."" And so where do you think we are on the sort of Putin question generally, as you would see in terms of what you would take to be a sound understanding of it, of him and of it?"
lMErQwTUXV4,6998,Tom Tugendhat,"And he's managed to get German foreign policy changed pretty radically in recent months. His Zeitenwende , his sort of time of change as it were that he spoke about in February means that he's pledged 100 billion euro to German defense spending, which is, it's not nothing. That's a hell of an increase. And he's speaking about different ways of helping the Ukrainian people as well, so that's not nothing. Although, I did read recently that a Polish minister was referring to the end of Ostpolotik politic and the beginning of ""lost politik."" And there is a tension now between some of those countries that border Russia or near border Russia, like Poland. I would say it borders Belarus rather than Russia. But those bordering states, near bordering states, and those that are further away, and there's a certain resentment between them and the level of commitment that some are showing and others could. And they'll have to show commitment at home, right? It'll be cold in the winter and energy prices will go up a lot and they may be, I don't know, rationing and so forth with gas and they let themselves get dependent on Russia. Unfortunately, we didn't do much to help them the other way, I will say, to be fair to them. Everyone beats up Germany, but it wasn't as if we were saying..."
F0ue4k5den8,7478,Tom Tugendhat,"It corrupts just all of it. And the reality is we know that Putin has been doing this for 15 years, but sadly, when I started calling it out five, six years ago, what was it, yeah, about five years ago, many people around the world thought this was some sort of anti-Russian paranoia. And that this was, frankly, it's minor, it's nothing and Putin's not that bad really. And I kept pointing out, this is a guy who in 2007 launched a massive cyber attack on Estonia, in 2008 invaded and still occupies Georgia, and at various points in recent years has shot down a civilian aircraft killing nearly 300 people over Ukraine. I mean, this is a guy who is quite literally a mass murderer. He has actually murdered many, many people around the world. He's assassinated several people in the UK, including using a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury, a chemical weapon which his henchmen was so cavalier about, they had it in a perfume bottle, had that liquid got into the drains and got into the water supply he could have killed quite literally thousands of people. And he clearly had absolutely no care about it at all. And we know that he's triggered explosions in ammunition depots in Prague. We know that he's tried to assassinate the Deputy Prime Minister of Montenegro, amongst other people."
Yv47kw1UZRg,7498,Tom Tugendhat,"We know that the Russians had sent in death squads to try and catch and kill various members of the Ukrainian leadership team, including Zelensky and his family, and for those first few weeks and months, probably still today actually, as far as I know, I mean for all I know, sorry, he was having to sleep in snatched moments, and move around the whole time, and with bodyguards who he trusted, and be very, very careful never to be caught anywhere, you know? But he still did it. He stayed, and he demonstrated something, and I think you mentioned him, but Senator McCain and others have demonstrated at various points, President Reagan demonstrated it, various others have demonstrated it. Courage in leadership matters. It can be game-changing. It can be inspiring, you know? Winston Churchill demonstrated it for us, most famously, and others have demonstrated it at other times, but it really can be game-changing, and President Zelensky demonstrated it. I think we underestimate the importance of President Zelensky's courage to the shape of the world as it will be in 10 years time. If we don't recognize the effect that having Putin victorious in Ukraine, and Belarus, would have had on countries like Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and the pressure that that would have put on NATO, and therefore on European liberty."
PkKUi5S3Lc5,7459,Jack Goldsmith,"It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime. It may be that previous Justice Departments have overreached in indicting people for things or investigating people for things, but there's at least been the claim that there's an actual statute somewhere in the, what's it called, the code of whatever it's called, the legal code. UC Code, yeah. Yeah. There's like Statue 1274, which someone violated. Well, we don't usually... Let me just back. Yes, first of all, I wasn't surprised, because he did that all throughout his first term. He did it all throughout the campaign. So the thing that surprised me last Sunday was the moderating part, not the part about people needing to go to jail. Yeah, we don't typically have presidents talking about who should go to jail. Biden actually did once in violating norms during his term and said some other things he shouldn't have said. But typically, presidents don't even talk about this stuff. And typically, law enforcement doesn't talk about people going to jail. They talk through investigations and indictments, and the indictments come down and they specify the alleged facts and the law that was allegedly violated. And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump."
sD1GyvexKvc,7046,Jack Goldsmith,"So I would say there are two stages, one, the three or four month stage, but then Trump is capable of causing chaos at any moment, and that's going to be an ongoing thing for four years. So it's going to be very hard to say, okay, we now know what's going to happen because he could... And who knows which one of his new subordinates he's going to have fallings out with. He's already fired his White House council before and gotten a second one. He's lost one nominee. I mean, this idea that this is going to be a disciplined organization compared to the first one I think is yet to be proven. And I suppose just on the first three or four months, we'll also see these second and third tier appointments, which the overall character of which you mentioned OLC in particular, but will be pretty important. Does the FBI suddenly have 20 non-career people there working for Patel, or is it basically one director and some career- I'm pretty sure that... Maybe is an inspector general in the FBI or is it in the DOJ? But I'm pretty sure that the FBI director is the only political appointment in the bureau. Up until now, but this will be- Well, we'll see if they can use the civil service rules and the two- I'm going to say that's one instance of just..."

And that's the way these things typically work. So this is all way outside normal, but it's normal for Trump. And let me just say, part of what Trump is about is to just blow up all these norms. He thinks or talks or acts as if he thinks that they're just illegitimate, that they're corrupt, that the Justice Department is under the control of the deep state or the Democrats or some combination of both. And there were some deep state shenanigans against him in his first term, and I get it, but this is all completely out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, it's started to become ordinary. There's so many things, nobody, just to change topics for a second, nobody in this election talked about tax disclosure, very few people. That was a big deal in 2016, 2020. Trump defied it twice, and now, nobody cares. And it had been in practice for, what, 40 years or something like that? Going back to Watergate, going back either to Ford or Carter, I can't remember. And same with conflict of interest rules, very little discussion of that. Now, it's just accepted, now, that they're not going to follow the statutory rules, almost very few of them, and none of the important ones apply to the president."
5AKCgbT2Oke,7208,Jack Goldsmith,"So they can both have big roles here. Ultimately, I think the Attorney General, again, who knows how those two are going to get along, but ultimately, the Attorney General is in charge on almost every matter. And so, again, one can be optimistic or pessimistic about what they're going to do. And I suppose whether it's one as optimistic or pessimistic is in the eye of the beholder. Yeah, Trump was amazing on just this past Sunday to ""Meet the Press."" He had, I'd say, half the time, was being pretty careful to, ""I'm not going to order anyone to do anything. It's their call."" On other issues too, mass deportations, while the Dreamers. ""Well, we try to work that out with Democrats."" And then, the other half of the time, it was, ""Well, Liz Cheney deserves to be in jail."" Right. And that, I found a little astonishing from the president elect to say about a member or former members of Congress, all the members of that committee deserve to go to prison. And what was striking in some of the commentary was we're so used to Trump, A, some of it's dismissed maybe correctly, it's just Trump being Trump and blowing off steam and so forth. It is kind of amazing to say that people should go to prison without specifying a crime."
mPGe16IO_Ce,7583,Jack Goldsmith,"And a very high percentage of pardons, when you think about it, including Clinton's example, which are pretty deplorable, the huge majority of them are cleaning the record as a favor of someone. Maybe you shouldn't do it. It's not quite equitable. But the two previous family pardons, Bill Clinton's brother, I think had served a year in jail in the '80s. Clinton pardoned him in 2000 to kind of clear the record, so to speak, and the same was true... There's another one, which I'm blanking on, but where it's a very similar situation. Yeah, I can't remember, but there's one other. It's a previous... It's an old, so to speak. Yes. This was the middle of a court case. He'd gone to trial, he'd chosen to go. It was kind of messed up the way the plea deal fell apart, but he'd chosen, in any case, to go to trial. There was a jury. It wasn't like this was some arbitrary star chamber thing. I don't think people thought the trial was particularly unfairly conducted or anything. He was, of course, ready to appeal. He had plenty of attorneys to do that. I feel like doing it in the middle like that is more egregious in a way than doing a favor for someone that you respect or to be fair to someone you think was a good civil servant, a good public servant who deserves to, in a sense, have a break retrospectively."
te1XKuICx8F,17982,Anne Applebaum,"Buying certain kinds of American products or big investments, investing in American defense technology, by accepting the dominance of American tech companies. All of that has taken place in the context of a world in which the US and Europe were somehow on the same page, in which we cooperated together and we weren't perceived as threats to one another. And really very suddenly all that looks different. And I can't tell you right now exactly what the implications will be or whether it can be reversed by further actions down the line. I mean, I suspect among other things that Putin doesn't really want to end the war. And so, I don't know exactly what the... I still have no idea what Trump is talking about when he says the war will end this week or it'll end by May. I'm not sure what he means. But all those things suddenly begin to look different. And the conversations happen in all kinds of contexts. So in boardrooms, in government offices, everyone who deals with the United States in any context is suddenly saying, ""Wait, are all the assumptions that I've based 30 years of decisions on or 80 years of decisions on, are all those assumptions wrong?"" And again, maybe this is going to be reversed and maybe it's not going to be as extreme as people think."
xvgCtIseNqR,20295,Anne Applebaum,"And that was part of why they won the first battle of Kiev. And I just don't know how the comments of Trump will affect people fighting on the ground and working on behalf of troops. So it's very hard to say, but they do have cards. They're better prepared now. They have an army that's a million people strong. For fighting this particular kind of war, they are not in a bad position. And so there's no feeling there that this front line is about to collapse. That's good. And I do think... I mean, Trump has gone very far in the direction he's gone in and all the talk about Keith Kellogg. He's pretty pro-Ukraine, and he's going to make a difference. That seems a little farcical right now at least. But I think especially if Ukraine doesn't collapse and if the fight slogs along unsatisfactorily but not disastrously for Ukraine, and if Putin is unreasonable and won't take yes for an answer, which is quite possible since he wants to destroy Ukraine and conquer Kiev and, as you've argued many times, not simply have a little more territory, I mean, he might take that as a temporary thing, but he might not even take that as a temporary thing at this point. I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress?"
FtrW79XRI6E,17750,Anne Applebaum,"He will be pro- defense. He will pro-Ukrainian. He will want to work with France and Britain and Poland and others to create some kind of new defense alliance within the various alliances. And so, I am going to be positive today and I'm going to say it's a good thing. Yeah. I want to get to the alliances and the rest of Europe in a second. Just one more note on Germany itself. I guess I'm struck that-we're speaking Monday morning right after the Sunday elections-they fell a little, well yeah 20.7% of vote or something like that, the AFD, Alliance for Deutschland. Incidentally, Vance's intervention was more direct. He supported the AFD. Certainly, on Twitter and said nice things about them repeatedly before coming to even to Munich. And of course, Musk was just all in including putting a heavy thumb on the scale in terms of X. Algorithms. Yeah... what was Twitter. There's a very interesting study that showed the degree to which it's not just, oh, the algorithms naturally lead to a certain kind of extremism, which is probably true incidentally as well. But that they actually, if you had a neutral test, so to speak, they push towards the, I guess we're not quite supposed to call it a neo-Nazi party, but I call it an anti- anti-Nazi party."
lZFZFony8gE,18150,Anne Applebaum,"They had many, many friends and colleagues across the military and across the US government. If General Milley to take an obvious example in 2020 had resigned, all the other chiefs would've resigned. A ton of three-star generals would've resigned. Maybe the Secretary of State would've felt he had to resign, Pompeo. I mean, the degree to which Trump has got people who have no authority or independent standing. I think your own work on autocracy has emphasized that point, and he's gone further in that direction, I guess, than even I expected. I think it's also really important to understand that this is not a conservative movement. It's not even... I wouldn't even say it's a right-wing movement. I mean, it's the wrong way to think about it. It's something... This is a radical movement. These are people whose understanding of the world comes from online conspiracy theories. They are not based in reality. They are skeptical of science. They're skeptical of all existing institutions, whatever they do, whether it's the FBI or the Army. They're not the kinds of people who have ever been in the US government before. And so there's a qualitative difference. You see, online, people saying, ""Oh, well, Reagan started it, and this is the obvious conclusion of the conservative revolution or the conservative movement."" No, this is not."
YktGqiPv3z4,18272,Anne Applebaum,"I wonder if in the US there couldn't be more of a reaction against what Trump's doing than people think, including by the Republicans in Congress? And I'm the last person to put any hopes in them at this point, but half of them did vote for aide for Ukraine less than a year ago. Are they literally going to, just because Trump decides he's... Not decides. Trump has been a friend of Putin's and remains a friend of Putin's so to speak, or an ally Putin's almost. Are they simply going to give up on that? It wouldn't take that many Republicans to join the Democrats to conceivably stop Trump from doing a [aid] package, even? I guess I'm slightly more hopeful than some people that... I mean, generally presidents have a huge amount of power on foreign policy, very hard to override them when they're going at a certain direction. And sometimes that's good and sometimes that's bad. This time, it's very bad, I think. But I don't know. So for whatever it's worth my sense of if it could snowball in a very bad direction, or the opposite could happen. If it turns out that this attempt by Trump to sort of collapse in a sense, the fight against Putin doesn't work, you could get some others saying, here, ""Wait a second, we shouldn't go in this direction."" Maybe I'm being too hopeful."
_viK2K3XlpN,7050,Invisible Rulers,"I would argue that that same concern about what happens when China controls your feed, right? That was the topic around TikTok, is what happens when a CEO you don't trust controls your feed? What happens when Elon Musk controls your feed, right? Because Elon Musk owns Twitter. And right now you can... And I am not saying that Elon Musk is doing anything nefarious, but the point is... I'll say that. You can not say that. RENÉE DIRESTA: But the point is, Elon Musk, when he bought Twitter, significantly changed how content was weighted in the feed, right? ""Blue checks"" all of a sudden were for sale, and their content would be ranked higher, their replies would be ranked higher, and people could monetize. And what I was referencing earlier, influencers who wanted to make money wanted to be more sensational, and then the algorithm would curate that, would curate that content, because people would engage with it. And so you would see a very different style. Like your feed, when people say, ""My feed on X is totally different now,"" that's because the incentives are different and the way that it's ranked is different. And the person who controls that is X, which is now owned by one person. So what's the alternative? It's to move to platforms where you have better control over your own feed."
Kpln52V4s5F,7287,Invisible Rulers,"And the interesting thing about Coughlin though is that, normal people can't be counter speakers in that moment. Normal people aren't on the radio. So, the one thing social media does offer is the opportunity for instantaneous counter speech. Whereas what happens with Coughlin is, they try to make him pre-clear his broadcast. So they've essentially appoint an official censor to go there and see if he's cleared to speak, which kind of has some parallels to content moderation. They have a person, essentially a fact-checker, come on right after him to say, ""Father Coughlin lied to you about the following things."" And then eventually, the Catholic Church kind of yanks him and is like, ""Okay, you're done."" And I tell the story in the book in kind of greater detail because it really is an incredible parallel to the modern moment. On social media, the theory is that counter- Just on the thirties for a second. Of course, the counter, that worked out okay in the US ultimately, sort of. Mostly- RENÉE DIRESTA: Well, I mean there was a war. Yeah. Well, no. And the reason there was war is because of Hitler mostly. And the reason Hitler succeeds in large part, people thought at the time, and I have no reason to doubt it, because he's the first, in Germany at least, maybe in continental Europe in general, to understand the potential of radio."

There's no evidence offered beyond the theory, but that's where we've kind of gotten to. Well, or some sort of fake evidence of some, as you say, misread spreadsheet. Or they like actually evidence in the wrong way. Right? Conspiracy theories always like... Joe McCarthy waved around the lists.

Well, people who believe Elon, when he says that there was, what was it, 50 million in condoms to Gaza or something, that's just wild theories come out of nowhere. And the fact check doesn't reach people. It takes it to another level, as you say, when he's standing in the Oval Office, and then when a whole bunch of government organizations, and he's got huge people in government who want to keep him happy, have a big incentive to these things.

And so majority illusion is the people who are around you shape what you think the majority opinion is, right? You see these stories where Trump wins and people are like, ""Whoa, how could that possibly have happened? Nobody I know voted for him."" In the case of the vaccine thing though, it's a great example because the only people who were posting about vaccines at the time, this was in around 2013, 2014 timeframe. 2014, 2015 was when we were trying to get this bill passed. Only the anti- vaxxers were posting. And that's because most people go and they get their kid vaccinated and nothing happens and they don't post about it. This is the same phenomenon with the flat earthers. You can find flat earth content, but not round-earth content because nobody is creating the round- earth Facebook group."
cskKgZjQmLV,2953,Ryan Goodman,"Just something that recently happened and I was writing it up, I was just describing it for something and then in writing it up, I was like, oh, my God, look at what I'm actually writing. Can you believe this? Because we've normalized it and here's what it was. Elon Musk threatens that he will help people primary Republicans who vote for the massive spending bill. He threatens that and then he threatened it again. And he threatened not just that again, but then he most recently last like 48 hours, threatened that he would create a third party. What happens within 12 to 24 hours? Donald Trump on Truth Social says, oh, well, we're now going to use DOGE to look into all of the government contracts and support for Elon Musk's companies. And that's just, excuse me, that's just fucking crazy that the President of the United States is going to try to directly penalize somebody for political activity. Elon Musk is fully within his rights if that's what he'd like to do. And all he's saying is expressing political views and using his political muscle and the President of the United States, it doesn't even do it silently as Richard Nixon might've done, but he is publicly saying, we're going to retaliate against you in a way that's unethical, illegal, and the rest of it."

And so he clarifies his order. He doesn't do new orders like clarifying like ""No, no, no. It applies to the DOJ obviously facilitated the military flights"", for example, and DHS did. Like, how did those people get onto the flight? And so, the Supreme Court is giving a blessing to all of that. It's not even touching that. No explanation for it, et cetera. My hope is in a certain sense that the reason that the court did what it did is a very technical reason, and that it's one of Judge Murphy's orders was nationwide, and the other orders were not, they were specific to the people who were on the flight to South Sudan. And that's what the court was doing because they were about to issue the CASA decision on nationwide injunctions. But here we are a few days out from the CASA decision, if that's the explanation, where are we? They didn't do that. And then other immigration cases as well, which the court is not being great on immigration for decades now."
_lm9fzm6JHU,3154,Ryan Goodman,"So, I think Trump is supercharged after that opinion as he did with a performance with a press conference. So, that's where I think it's not understanding the moment that we're in with this particular person in the White House. Yeah, it seems like they haven't given him that many victories on the big substance yet. Perhaps whether it's Humphrey's Executor will be radically limited, or struck down, and we'll see what happens on some of these other Alien Enemies Act, even some of them that presumably might go against Trump, presumably on the executive order on birthright citizenship. But certainly procedurally, I guess is the way I think of it. Maybe I'm simple minded, but they're giving him the benefit of the doubt an awful lot. And again, maybe in a very narrow sense, some of those decisions are their judgment calls, or whatever. It's a matter of court procedure. It's not a of high constitutional principle, but the effect of it is to let him go very far in practice down the path he's on without the courts being able, while curbing really the ability of the lower courts to do much to stop him. And in that context, that DVD decision at the beginning of last week, so that was the sixth three decision on Monday, I guess before the six-three decision on Friday that you mentioned the CASA decision."
4197arSoosz,3012,Ryan Goodman,"Maybe I'm wrong though. I don't know. And how much of this is a choice and how much of this is just the courts can't stop a lot of stuff. Yeah. No. Yeah. So I do think... a number of thoughts on it. One, as you say, that is their theory of the case that he can do it whenever, and it really is. So one of the things I'm tracking are these extremist positions that the administration, the DOJ is taking before the courts. So on the federalization of the Guard, the DOJ before Judge Breyer in California in the district court level, in fact says, and I think it's multiple times, but it says in the oral argument, one of the hearings, ""The president can do this on the basis of no evidence."" No evidence that it's needed to have the Guard protect ICE agents or buildings, on the basis of no evidence. And Judge Breyer says, ""Really, you're making the argument they can do it on the basis of no evidence?"" And they're like, ""No, that's our argument, no evidence."" I mean, that's one part of the extremity of it. And then the second one, which you mentioned, Bill, which is that their briefs say that it's just if there's some inability to carry out law enforcement functions, and admittedly, the State of California has a little bit of the other extreme, so they're like, oh no, if it's completely impossible to carry out the functions."
QvNoe7Pi5fS,3011,Ryan Goodman,"It's not predicated on riots. It's predicated on violence or political protests. The part of the executive order that applies across the country that's anticipatory or preemptive also is only based on protests, if there is a threat of protests. So that's how extreme that is. Back to your particular question of what can the courts do about it, at some level I was a little surprised even that Judge Breyer at the District Court did try to stop on the administration from the federalization of the Guard because courts give so much deference to the executive branch. There's also some indication from the Court of Appeals panel, even though they find in favor of the Trump administration, that they say, ""We're also not going to accept the Trump administration's position,"" which is that this is all complete and deference political question doctrine, that the court shouldn't be involved. That they do some analysis of the facts, which I think is positive, but courts are weak in this particular space. To me, it's one of their spaces in which courts... one should not rely on the courts. I don't have faith that the Supreme Court is going to push back against the power of a president to say that there's a national emergency and need to bring out the National Guard to protect federal buildings, federal functions."
1fUpoYU_7_n,4037,Eric Edelman,"He is got a Ukrainian presence in Kursk which is under pressure, and the Russians are taking back territory, but more slowly than they are in Eastern Ukraine. So it's not a great... and the economy's in terrible shape. He is relying on North Korean soldiers because he doesn't want to have a full mobilization because he is afraid of what the political effects would be in St. Petersburg, in Moscow if he did that. So he's under pressure too. And so I can imagine him wanting to get some kind of respite, and I can imagine him thinking he can work it around so that he gets a ceasefire under maximally advantageous conditions to Russia. He can then rebuild, reconstitute, and then go after Ukraine again in a couple of years. Interesting. One word on Europe, since you served there in Prague and elsewhere, followed it very closely from when you were back at the State Department here at home and Defense. It seems like German government just fell, they'll have elections. The French government presidency is very weakened as they keep turning over Prime Ministers. Problems elsewhere. Also, problems in Central Europe as well and Eastern Europe, different kinds of governments, different flavors. Hungary, without going through everything, which we can't, what...I guess Trump will just... I don't know, what do you think there?"
_CLy6ebtGGk,4153,Eric Edelman,"And of course, he won't have most of anyone confirmed at the beginning, and he may not get some of these secretaries confirmed at all. And Hegseth, I suppose, or Gabbard. And then of course, second and third tier people, even in a normal administration, take a while to confirm. Maybe this Republican Senate will be very, very solicitous and get them through fast. But yeah, I think the degree of just the combination of chaos and to be fair to them, challenges they inherit or they confront and their own management style of course, and then things that could happen and adversaries may be looking at the situation and thinking this is a pretty good time to... But if you're Putin, don't you think, ""Look, I'm going to call Trump on January 22nd. He wants an early victory. I'm going to make it pretty attractive to him here, to have a negotiation with me at a summit, and we're really going to make this happen,"" and he'll find some fake concession he didn't make before, or something like that? I don't know, maybe not. Or maybe he'll do the opposite attitude. Putin wants to conquer all of Ukraine. Ultimately, he'd like to march into Kiev and maybe he'll decide Trump is preoccupied and dealing with budget government shutdowns, and he can just stiff-arm Trump and end up winning everything at 18 months."
_8kBN3Rhuzu,4155,Eric Edelman,"So if there's anything that Donald Trump understands, it's strength and weakness. So it depends on who's going to be briefing him, of course. But one would think that Mike Walz and Marco Rubio, who have traditionally been pretty firm supporters of Ukraine or were at the outset of the war, less so this past year when they were among those who voted against the April assistance package, but who certainly understand the dynamics here. There is a possibility that Trump might see it in his interest to strengthen Ukraine in order to get Putin to the table and get a negotiated settlement. But on the other hand, you can also see certain forces saying, ""Just cut off the Ukrainians,"" the Tucker Carlson.... The next tranche of aid expires fairly early in the Trump administration... Not expires, but gets exhausted. It's hard to imagine, Trump's the president who asked for more aid for Ukraine after everything we've been through with the Republicans on The Hill and with Trump and Vance and so forth. Maybe that's possible, but I suppose that... Anyway, that moment of truth will be a 2025 moment of truth. Yeah, and there are a couple of points here. So the Biden administration has been trying to get as much of the assistance that was approved last April out the door as it can, and the assistance comes in two flavors."
FzGYukJx5jP,3988,Eric Edelman,"Erdogan prevailed on Trump to pull US forces back. Trump tried to get them all out, the so-called adults in the room, Jim Mattis and others, kept this small force there. Whether they'll be able to prevail on him a second time, up in the air, but Erdogan also had, like the Saudis, a family-to-family relationship with the Trump family. And the Trump organization, of course has business interests in Istanbul. Again, this was a son-in-law-to-son-in- law relationship. How much of that stays in place with Jared Kushner formally outside the administration? Little hard to tell, but as you say, yes, the relationship with Erdogan was a very cozy one, and that could have a role here. So keeping an eye on Trump's decision to seal down those troops in Syria is another little thing that people haven't focused on that could be quite a big deal early on. And he could be under some pressure from his own people who want to get US troops out of all these places since we shouldn't be involved in Middle East wars. Yikes. So after Trump gets this briefing on the Middle East, it'll occur to someone for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. He'll be impatient anyway, but it'll occur to someone that will, ""Hey, it's the largest land war in 80 years that's going out of Europe, and that you've pledged to end, Mr."
QMyvruSZzFF,4217,Eric Edelman,"Who knows what might happen? I think a lot of unexpected things can happen. The Russian army could crack under the strains it's under; the Ukrainian army could crack. They're in extremis right now. So, you could get a catastrophic collapse on the battlefield of some sort or other. I'm not predicting that; I'm just saying these are the kinds of things that could happen. You could get a collapse of the North Korean regime. The Assad regime, nobody thought it was going to collapse in two weeks. These regimes always look strong, but they're completely fragile and on the inside. Russia is more fragile than we think. Think back to the Prigozhin mutiny, I think it's arguable that had Prigozhin not lost his nerve, he might have actually taken Moscow. So, all of these things are out there. The Chinese still spend more on internal security than they do on external security, which is an indication of how concerned the leaders are about their own populace. It's the nature of all of these regimes. The Iranian regime, the collapse of Assad and the success of the Israeli retaliation rate in Iran have exposed, I think, the fragility of that regime, which is loathed by the majority of the population. So, the potential for upheaval, unanticipated shifts is always out there and tends to impose itself on every administration that comes in."
86TRpoUymr-,13020,John Bolton,"And from other departments and so forth. Nixon IRS-type things, obviously, but also the degree of internal crisis of governance we could have. Don't you think- That's exactly right. It'll make the Saturday Night Massacre look like a tea party because the number of enemies he wants to prosecute is so large that this is really going to overload the Justice Department system. In other departments, you could see similar things. For example, Trump decides to order the 82nd Airborne onto the streets of Portland Oregon because he doesn't like what's going on. Who knows what his reason is? But the Posse Comitatus law, which generally prohibits the use of the military and law enforcement, is a very strong and important tradition. What's Pete Hegseth going to do? He is just going to say, ""Yes, sir?"" Maybe so. So, he then turns to the pertinent military commander and says, ""Do this."" What's that military commander going to do if he's got a legal opinion from some career Department of Defense lawyer that says that violates Posse Comitatus, you know officers are not supposed to carry out illegal orders. That's why Lieutenant Calley got prosecuted for the My Lai Massacre. You don't carry out orders to do that sort of thing. Are they going to refuse to carry out an illegal order?"
m8CvqO1nD8h,13315,John Bolton,"When Mel Laird was Secretary of State for Richard Nixon, David Packard of Hewlett- Packard was the deputy, and everybody said, ran it in a very significant way. But nonetheless, Hegseth has got to convince Republicans, who have dealt with many of the people that you mentioned, that he can be up to the job. Whether he can do it or not is anybody's guess. And again, I'm just leaving the personal stuff out, which could be disqualifying on its own. Just as a professional matter, it's not on his resume now. People forget there will be these confirmation... It's all happened so fast. It's not Thanksgiving yet, and the old Congress is still not in session exactly, but in power and authority, until the new Congress convenes on January 3rd or 4th or whatever it is, right after the new year. And that's when the confirmation hearings begin. Right? Right. And I assume those will happen, and some of them will happen in those first two weeks before the inauguration. Sometimes a few of them happen the week or two after, but usually, they try to do it in January. Yeah, no, in past administrations, many people have been confirmed on the 20th of January, they hold the hearings, they had the FBI background checks. The President turns over the nominations, maybe before lunch, after the inauguration, the Senate votes 10 or 12 of them through."
dG9VwSfEOYC,13316,John Bolton,"So it'll be interesting to see how Trump responds. But my guess is Republican Senators are basically finding ways to do this behind the scenes, not to have a public confrontation with the President, which would hurt them and hurt him, but clear this detritus away more quietly. And presumably the Gaetz example would embolden them a little bit in that? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I feel like that weakened Trump a little more than I realized. At the time, it was sort of that's smart of him to just pull it. You don't have the votes. You pull it. [inaudible] to the Hill on Wednesday, you pull him on Thursday, you don't have a week of drip, drip, drip, which is often what happens in these cases and all that. But I now think pulling it so quickly and without really even explaining anything and without defending him particularly or anything, or I don't know, maybe it looks a little bit like, ""Okay, if that can happen to Gaetz, it could happen to one or two others if you're sitting there on the Hill."" No, I think that's right. I mean, in part, this was Trump-induced because his people were saying, ""He's totally in charge. He's invincible. He's going to get whatever he wants. These 53 Republican Senators are just a bunch of lickspittles, and they'll acquiesce very quickly."" And then they didn't."
4o1T0a08HRa,13615,John Bolton,"I mean, he knows there's a lot of other stuff out there, but he doesn't really care about it. Department of Housing and Urban Development barely passes his radar screen education. These are just not things he cares about, but subordinates in the White House pursuing what they think his agenda is could cause a lot of turmoil in departments by the things they're doing. And that slows the work of everybody down. I mean, while I have you here ... I can't resist asking about Trump himself. You've spent more time with him than 99.99% of Americans and very intense times sometimes and very important issues in the Oval Office every day. A, I mean ... well, you wrote about him in the book, but the judgment, do you have a sense he's changed some? Anything you would say that those ... A lot of Americans saw him in the first term and decided they could live with that. Obviously, they voted for him, but it's four years later, I don't know. What's your sense? Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him."
p9woW6rth9Y,15977,John Bolton,"Well, it's important to state every time he does not have a philosophy. There is no Trumpism. He wants to do what he wants to do. He doesn't think in terms of policy, he thinks in terms of what Donald Trump wants and how that will benefit him. It's ad hoc transactional, episodic, inconsistent. And there has been no change that I've seen in his behavior. What some people say, ""Well, he's gotten worse over time, he got worse during the first four years, he got worse during the intervening four years."" I don't think that's right. I think what has changed is that behavior and statements that I and many others saw in private in the first term, he now has no inhibition about saying publicly. I mean, he curses like a sailor in some of these rallies and people just think it's great. It sounds like even more outrageous things. But as I say, those are just things he said in private before. And I think his focus on what benefits Donald Trump, what makes him look good, that's going to dominate all of his calculations for the next four years because that's all he's got. I mean, in particular, anything ... What worries you the most? I mean either policy areas, the kind of judgments? The most serious unquestionably in the national security area, all of his neuron flashes are isolationist."
lvccR9T6v18,5095,Steve Vladeck,"And at least since the 1880s, we've had a robust tradition of a civil service, of a statutorily and regulatory protected civil service where folks can earn protection from being fired, where we don't expect the janitor at the Department of Energy to be someone who's hired or fired because of their connections to the current president. Yeah. And the trade-off was, in a way they accepted perhaps lower salaries and less opportunities for big windfalls because they had the security of a government job. Now within that category, as someone who was chief of staff of a department, they were the Schedule C employees, the political appointees who were fireable, hireable at will basically and fireable at will. They were a rather small number- I mean, that's the key. ...were at least of this huge pyramid. And then there was this massive civil service space. So Trump is going way beyond, I mean of course every administration removed, if it comes in with succeeding the opposite party, pretty much all the Schedule C's leave and you put in your own Schedule C's. So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments."
bfK5uJOHZTV,5184,Steve Vladeck,"And I think it's almost literally true that no one like that is there in the power agencies... is really ... That's been a wake- up call. And then the question becomes even if there is a reaction among the public, which I think there most likely will be, does it catch up to sort of the momentum of the internal destruction of norms and checks? And the answer sadly is going to be, it will never fully catch up. And we're going to no matter how things go from here, even on the optimistic account, we're going to look back at this period with a lot of regret and a lot of woe. But the critical point, and I think this is a point that is underscored by history, is the time to sort of lay down the marker and stand up is earlier rather than later, right? You fight the war, not when it's best for you to fight it. You fight the war when you can minimize the damage. And minimizing the damage isn't going to make everybody whole, but we should be all invested in minimizing the damage at this point as opposed to any scenario where Trump is given more of an opportunity to make it worse. No, that's so well said. It's a good note to end on."
p4Oa-L5H6Q1,4855,Steve Vladeck,"Bill, it has not been part of the unitary executive theory or arguments or push that the president can therefore fire the entire civil service. And so my own assumption is that this Supreme Court, and I mean the one we have right now, is not going to be especially in a hurry to stand up to Trump when it comes to firing people like Hampton Dellinger, the head of an agency, but actually is very much going to stand up for the civil service if and when we get a case to the court. The problem is that there's such this like, complicated labyrinthine administrative process for civil servants to challenge their firings that getting that case to the court could take some time. And I suppose as I understand it from Project 2025 and talking to John DiIulio and others about this who know a lot about the internal workings of the federal government, if something like Schedule F, which would vastly increase the number of political appointees, the Schedule C's I mentioned before, there's a schedule, there's also ABCD. This is F. This would be a new schedule, I think. Trump tried to do it at the very end of his first term, and it never went anywhere. But if there were 40,000 of them, instead of the four or 5,000, I think it is Schedule C's, that I think he has quite a lot of ability to just do on his own."
6H7nCygAbJF,5005,Steve Vladeck,"I don't know, presumably- Crimes. What? I mean, he's accused, right? He accused Representative Ocasio-Cortez of breaking the law, right? Yeah. He's accusing of breaking the law for their Congressional... for giving speeches. And so all this kind of craziness, the domestic terrorism on Tesla is kind of... One could see it being more extreme 18 months from now. A lot would depend on the courts and the Congress. I mean everything would depend I suppose, on the courts and Congress. Courts, of course, are a bit of a changing thing because Trump gets to make appointments, maybe not at the Supreme Court, depending on whether people retire but at the appellate and district court level. So I'm just curious, I mean, A, what do you think about the next, let's say this term of the court? I think that's an obvious moment to think about. And then more broadly the next year and a half in terms of sort of risks, what worries you the most? What kind of encourages you a bit, et cetera? So just one note on the courts. I mean, it's interesting Bill, that we're 50 days into the administration and we have not seen a rash of judicial retirements. Usually, when you have a political turnover, a partisan turnover, a whole bunch of judges who were waiting for the next president from their side of the aisle to be elected come right to the front the line and say, ""I'm stepping down."" We haven't seen that, which I think is an interesting data point."
2sIHI8Ek0XR,4822,Steve Vladeck,"So that part is not controversial, I think. No, but your point about numbers is I think the important one, which is, right, the issue here is not trying to resist President Trump's ability to have his own hand-picked folks at those jobs that have always been political appointments. The point is everything else. So the firing of probationary employees, many of whom are not actually probationary, right? Maybe many of whom were 15, 20-year veterans of their agencies who were just recently promoted. Right. Those are not the folks who are- Yeah, the way that works is you're ""probationary"" for a year when you're in a new position, I believe. But as you say, many of them were quite very experienced and in fact probably were among the better employees because they were put in these new jobs and more responsibility. Right. And this is the problem. I mean, so whatever you think of the law, and I think a lot of what Trump has done in this space is unlawful, right? But even if you aren't troubled by the legal constraints here, the folks who are being fired are the folks who are the real just force of these agencies, the productive force, the folks who have moved up in the agencies as they've gotten more and more sophisticated, more and more experienced."
JrypDi5-dtw,6548,Aaron Friedberg,"Those people are out. He's put people in all these positions who are loyal to him, dependent on him, and in many cases, whose qualifications to hold the positions that they now hold seem to have more to do with their political loyalty than with their previous experience or their obvious expertise. So, he's put emphasis on control. The other thing, though, that's been going on is- And that 20th party Congress was just a few months ago. Right? Yeah, October 2022. So since as we talked of looking forward at it in our previous conversation and wondered if what you just described happened would happen, and it did happen. Yes, it did, and I think it was predictable. So, a third term as general secretary, he did not identify anyone as a possible successor, which, Chinese leaders have done in the past, which many people think means he intends to rule indefinitely. Because if you have a successor, they can become a kind of focal point for opposition to you if you're perceived to have screwed up, and he's not going to let that happen. So, I think the smart money would bet that we've got him for quite a while. Until his health fails, he's not going to... These guys don't generally retire peacefully, especially if you've thrown as many of your enemies in jail as he has."
3XwKlfJKiTw,6446,Aaron Friedberg,"If they do this or if they come to a moment when they're contemplating whether to do it, their decision is going to depend on an assessment of a whole array of factors of which the military ones are maybe not even the most important. They're going to be asking themselves in Beijing, how cohesive is the Democratic alliance? How strong is the US support for Taiwan? To what extent would US allies in the region come to our assistance? To what extent might our European allies do things, maybe not military things, but to support us and to oppose China if it tried to coerce or to conquer Taiwan. They're looking at all that. How effective could sanctions and embargoes be if they were imposed with force and speed as we did on Russia? All of that is going to be factored into the equation. And I guess my hunch is that their assessments of our political resolve and cohesion may ultimately be more important even than the military considerations, or once they reach a certain level of military capability, the judgment about whether to go or not to go is going to depend much more on these softer factors and their assessment of them than it is just on how many missiles and how many ships and so on."
TxouNLAn4ui,6859,Aaron Friedberg,"So, I think the smart money would bet that we've got him for quite a while. Until his health fails, he's not going to... These guys don't generally retire peacefully, especially if you've thrown as many of your enemies in jail as he has. He's got to stay on the tiger. And I think he intends to, partly because he sees himself as the crucial figure. The environment that Beijing, that Xi Jinping himself faces, has in many respects become more challenging over the last couple of years. And I guess we'll talk about the external part, but internally, there's COVID, COVID lockdowns, increasing dissatisfaction with those lockdowns, a sudden reversal of policy, abandonment of ""Zero COVID,"" letting the disease just sort of rip through the country. We don't know for sure, but it's probably been over a million people who have died of COVID just in the last month or so. So, they made a decision that their attempts to stamp it out were not going to succeed indefinitely, and they were willing to pay the human cost and the cost of some further temporary economic disruption to get through that and to get on with business. But even more important, I think, are the deeper sort of underlying challenges that China faces in trying to continue down the path of economic growth."
NQLX350NDLt,6420,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't mean to be complacent about it, but we should look at the broader picture and the things we can do to deter them by threatening to use or increasing our capacity to use a variety of different instruments. Which in part brings us back to where we started because I had this conversation in Europe with someone who follows China closely. I said, ""What's the most important thing you think we could all do?"" He said, ""Stick with Ukraine, win the war in Ukraine, make Putin's gamble really, really, really not pay off as they see the analogy and the lesson."" So, I was going to ask more broadly as we conclude what to look for over the next months and year, maybe in terms of US actions and other actions around the world that Chinese actions that might tip us off about where things are going. But I suppose Ukraine really matters, right? I think it does, and they're watching it closely. If Western resolve crumbles or if the Western alliance begins to break apart, that's going to make Beijing more confident that it can deal with whatever the consequences of their acting against Taiwan might be. They may be hoping that in the next American presidential election, a candidate will be elected who will be much less supportive of Ukraine and perhaps they'll take some comfort from that."
LpxBl0xKfVw,6968,Aaron Friedberg,"I don't think anybody in his right mind in the Chinese system is going to do that, certainly under Xi Jinping. So no, I think they had an interest in this trip. They would've been happy to have Blinken coming to Beijing. The visuals of that are favorable from their point of view. So, I don't think they deliberately sabotaged it. But they're committed enough to that intelligence gathering that they weren't willing either to, maybe they canceled it, so to speak, or to pull back the weeks before a summit. That wouldn't have been a crazy thing to do. I don't know, maybe it just has a certain autopilot character to it. They certainly weren't willing to apologize or to say it was a mistake, which they could have. I mean, we did after the U-2, right? I think, didn't we? I think. Eventually, afterwards. Maybe it took a while, right? Eisenhower was caught in a lie because he originally thought the plane had been destroyed and there was no evidence. So, he got up and said it was a weather plane, not knowing the Soviets actually had the pieces of it and knew that it was a spy plane. So yeah, at times they have done things that are provocative on the eve of or during visits by foreign dignitaries."
i_SIV3j1m9J,2941,Jason Furman,"And in a funny way, it's hard for him to do that, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, I was picturing what would've been going on in a normal White House over the weekend after the ""Liberation Day"" announcement. And when you saw what happened in markets on Thursday and Friday, what we would've done in the Obama administration, not what would've done, what we did do during the financial crisis-I'm pretty sure it's what the Bush administration did during the financial crisis-is the whole economic team is there in the White House, they're meeting together, chaired by the NEC director. The president would probably come in for some of those meetings, but he wouldn't be there obviously for all of it. And the goal of that entire weekend's of work would be to have an announcement to reassure markets, create a predictable path forward, and the time you would have for that announcement is before the Asian markets opened. You are always aiming to just create certainty and predictability before the first market in Asia opens, I think around 8:00 PM on Sunday Eastern time. And it doesn't seem like that's what happened over the weekend after ""Liberation Day"" in this administration, although obviously I'm not privy to everything they do. Well, the one thing we did see was almost everyone on some different Sunday TV show, I guess, secretary of the treasury, secretary of commerce, the..."
ugf_Z6NRmAy,2514,Jason Furman,"And he's threatened a 50% tariff on China against its retaliation. So the announcements are all about more tariffs. And by the way, there's other ones he's talked about, like if you buy oil from Russia we'll put a tariff on you, or buy oil from Venezuela. So everything he's talked about is higher tariffs. That being said, maybe he'll do lower tariffs. And that's the whole point is who knows. And do you think this is a big shock, that is to say there are other parts of economic policy, obviously monetary, fiscal, et cetera, tax policy, but does this dwarf whatever's likely to happen in those areas for the next few months or year? Or some of what will happen in those areas is reactive to this obviously, as we've been discussing with the Fed. But you think this is the big news, so to speak, of 2025. There is one piece of news that could be bigger. I still think it's an outside chance, but I've raised the odds that I attach to it, and that would be ending the independence of the Federal Reserve. What would that require? It would require not just replacing the chair, the chair is only one vote out of 12 on the FOMC, a very influential vote. But if you put a crazy person in his chair, they're not going to get 11 other votes for their vision."
qwq4q3RmpZ9,2430,Jason Furman,"This really puts the Fed in a bind. It gives them a worse set of choices than they had before. They can accept higher inflation in order to combat unemployment, or they can accept higher unemployment in order to combat inflation. Most likely they're actually going to do a combination of somewhat higher inflation and somewhat higher unemployment. And all of this is a bigger problem now because we went into this with an inflation rate of about 2.8%. And so inflation was already... hadn't come all the way back down to the landing we had wanted. That means the fear that this gets built into expectations built into the economy going forward is much more real than it might otherwise have been. And how quickly, just assume, again, oh, this policy sticks now for a couple of months at least, how quickly do we see the effects, do you think, on inflation and on unemployment or the inflationary side effects and the recessionary side effects, so to speak? Once again, unfortunately don't have enough historical experience to trace out what an economist would call the impulse response function- how the economy responds at every moment in time. My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are."
oWyol-fpwjy,2430,Jason Furman,"My gut instinct is that you see the price increases first before you see the larger increase in the unemployment rate. I think that's going to put the Fed more towards the, ""We don't cut interest rates,"" because you're seeing all the inflation before you're really sure about what the real economy effects are. And in terms of inflation, some prices are going up in April, which means when you get the CPI print in May, that'll show you the April numbers. I think you'll see some sort of pop there. And by the way, just as an aside, it does puzzle me that people in the Trump administration, their economic officials are saying it's not going to show up in prices because we're going to know the answer to this question. This is not like an academic study a decade from now is going to try to tease out the effects of this. It'll be clear and they will either be right or they'll be wrong. And I think they're pretty likely to be wrong. And how soon, I guess, will we really see, will there be just a consent? Well, if they're wrong, how soon will we know that in a sense, more certainly that we do just from the theories and the models and I guess the opposite also."
uOZXD7a4lI0,2552,Jason Furman,"And so they would try to figure out how to rule in a way that lets the president decide all executive branch things except monetary policy. That being said, the Supreme Court's a wild card. Donald Trump is a wild card. And I think this episode we've just gone through is a good reminder to care and pay more attention to some of the tail risks. It's not just Trump derangement syndrome to think he might do some of the things that he said he would do. I suppose the Fed would get into the crosshairs-and Trump's crosshairs-in a big way, if the economy slows. And he's always been a low-interest rate guy and he wants the Fed to cut, and he did in the first term, and he'll urge them to do it again. And Powell will say, ""I'm sorry, inflation is now at 3.7% or something, I can't cut."" And that would be the scenario, right? I suppose. Exactly. I think the most likely scenario where he goes after the Fed and- Exactly. We're heading into something where he wants them to do something they're not doing, and he doesn't really care as much about market constraints anymore, and there's been some permissiveness from the courts. So all of those are what could come together. And again, this is just something that is well within the realm of possibility."
NVfWUq27dzX,6906,Aaron Friedberg,"People made this comparison, I think we did when we talked last year, to the North Korean attack on South Korea in June 1950, and the decision that the Truman administration made to ratchet up defense spending and to solidify NATO and so on. Different, undeniably, and maybe less intense. It was pretty intense, but maybe it was different than the Russian attack on Ukraine, but there was a model there for rallying the American people, and it seems to have passed, unfortunately. Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly, obviously, for things that could... but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents. But the Trump thing is... I mean [inaudible], ""Oh, you don't like Trump, so you're just saying this."" But of course it really isn't just analytically so different that he's going to, presumably, going to be the nominee again. I was thinking about it. Take the Trump, take the Truman example, just a very simple way. Roosevelt in '44, and Truman in '48 all ran against Republicans who defeated the isolationist wing of their party and therefore were more or less..."
X3yDZ52xAba,6911,Aaron Friedberg,"We're all just sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they're dealing with now. Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you're saying is I just worry also though about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months. I mean, that is to say, what does the world look like in October of 2024? Are we confident Ukraine hangs on and is able to at least stabilize the situation, which itself isn't great in a way, a frozen war without USA? Are we confident there will be USA? Are we confident about what happens in the Middle East? What about the Taiwan situation? So, the degree of just a very short-term instability in the middle of an election year with Trump as the probable nominee and everyone and him saying certain things, weighing in on everything presumably, which then affects the instability. I mean, I think people, we haven't really gone through that either, honestly. And so, in a way, not really, I would say even in 2016 where people didn't think Trump was going to win or 2020. And again, that was all before February 2022 and before October 7, 2023. So yeah, we'll have a lot more to talk about even this year."
jINXupZ6Oh-,6834,Aaron Friedberg,"So it's a defeat for the mainland that the DPP won as the least pro-succumbing-to-the-mainland party and quite resistant to it actually. That's kind of their brand. But on the other hand, a defeat that they're going to try to deal with. Not one that's going to make them think, ""Oh gee, I guess we have to give up on those prospects of unification with Taiwan."" Yeah. And people have pointed out that there's now divided government, so I believe the KMT has a majority in the legislative branch. So, there are going to be some constraints on what this new president can do, and undoubtedly the PRC is going to try to work on those and slow down Taiwan's efforts to strengthen itself, in particular. The problem, I think, for China in the long run has been evident for a while, and this is just a reminder. And that is they really have lost any possibility of achieving, as they would put it, reunification in an uncoerced or peaceful way. For a long time, they did entertain the hope that they could do that. They thought maybe the KMT was the vehicle. But Taiwan has changed in the last 20 and 30 years, and more and more Taiwanese people think of themselves as Taiwanese first and not Chinese first."
oxyOst6WmKR,6806,Aaron Friedberg,"We went through some of this January 6th. But who knows what happens if he gets in. And that really is going to force everybody to recalibrate their thinking about the United States and about the role that we play. Of course, it's exaggerated, and it's led to some mistaken decisions to have this view as the United States as the indispensable power and so on. On the other hand, we are the poll in the tent that's holding up anything resembling a stable international order, at least among... in the democratic parts of the world, democratic with a small D. And if that's gone, I think we're going to see a lot of chaos. I think we're going to see a lot more conflict even than we've seen. Our allies are going to have to recalibrate and do various things, including potentially acquiring nuclear weapons of their own on the one hand. And on the other, what is that going to do to our opponents? And there's not a simple answer to that. I think there's reason to believe that Putin has been playing for this longer term with the hope that if Trump comes back, the pressure is going to be off him and support for Ukraine is going to be reduced if not eliminated, because I think our European friends would at least try to fill in if we were doing less."
oPenOXvSx1R,7052,Aaron Friedberg,"He might. But would he be as interested in supporting Taiwan as the current Democratic administration has been? I mean, there's some reason to have doubt about that. If you think about how Trump appears to make these calculations, what's Taiwan done for us? They've stolen our technology, and we should be making these semiconductors. So, the other thing I think from a Chinese perspective is the prospect that deepening divisions within the United States and between the United States and its allies are very much in their interest. I think they are for reasons that maybe we'll talk about next time around, they have significant problems of their own, but they also have still faith in their long-term prospects. And they're convinced that our internal problems and divisions are greater than theirs and are going to prevent us from responding as effectively as we might to what they're intending to do and what they have been doing. So would they rather see Trump elected in 2024 or not? I don't know. In one sense, maybe it doesn't matter to them. We're all just sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they're dealing with now. Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you're saying is I just worry also though about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months."
aaHsjVplliM,6913,Bill Galston,"And how much of an effect do you think the extremism of some Republican candidates in primaries, and some of them won their primaries, out of some of the law, the application of some of the laws that triggered in after the decision... Has that played a role also, in making pro-life just seem generically more extreme than perhaps it might otherwise have been? That's hard to judge, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised, and it is frequently the case that parties or factions are judged by the loudest and most extreme expressions of their views. This would not be the first time that's happened by a long shot. It's happened to Democrats over and over again, particularly in recent years, on issues having to do with criminal justice, immigration, schools, et cetera. And now the Republican party is learning what it feels like to be on the wrong side of that dynamic, which they are in this case. Yeah, you're right. I mean, if you're already sort of on the wrong side of public opinion, and then you've got a few people, or more than a few sometimes, on your side taking the extreme version of the wrong side, it does more damage, right? To the party as a whole. And it's also triggered discussion of a parade of horribles."
R0HjQQfSpfy,6737,Bill Galston,"It's almost hard to believe that that could be quite correct, but it is what it is, a real poll, and it ends up with Whitmer winning by 12 or 13, or something like that. And abortion, when asked, then is a big concern to a lot, especially of the Whitmer voters. And I'd be curious about thoughts on this while we're... And in the breakouts, I was talking with Ron Brownstein about this, who looked down at the cross tabs and so forth. It was penetrating, it was helping Whitmer a lot among working class white women, not just among college educated. I wonder if you think there's some potential for Democrats to ameliorate the damage that's been done to them among white working class in general, but especially women, perhaps if those women may not be so much on board. The Republican in Michigan has a pretty, I think, no exceptions stance on abortion. There are some women who are willing to accept a no exceptions stance, but not very many. That's hard turf to defend. Look, I think experience has taught both of us that a single state poll is not something you can put in the bank, but if it's confirmed by others, it will be more than suggestive. And I do think... Let me step back."
-Si1w5JLzjv,6943,Bill Galston,"So it's very specific. Let me just ratify your general point, and that is that Kansas is a red state, but it is a red state, I believe, with a democratic governor and it's a red state that indicated very, very forcefully at the ballot box that it was prepared to lean red but not to plunge into a vat of red dye. It said this far but no farther. And if you look at a state like Kansas, the sorts of people that it sends to the Senate, or at least used to send to the Senate, the Doles and the Kassebaums of this world, I think that ethos in Kansas is still there. And so we're going to have to differentiate a little bit more among quote, unquote ""red"" states. Kansas is not Alabama. And this is a [inaudible] of mine which I'll indulge for 30 seconds. I think you agree with it, though, that people who were... The last 10, 20 years, you would've been right about a lot of elections by saying demography is destiny, as you said, geography is destiny, It's the red districts, blue districts, and it's gotten more polarized. And so people like me who said, well, I don't know, that candidate's terrible, didn't matter. That candidate's good. If you were running for the Senate in South Carolina and you were a fine Democrat or Kentucky, didn't make any difference at all."
6-pAL6tIyb2,6568,Bill Galston,"Everyone can imagine circumstances that might come up, that might affect, if not oneself of course, but one's family members, or it has affected close family members or friends, and if you're a young person, it's more your own decisions, and if you're a mother or grandmother, as you say, or father or grandfather. But I also think people underestimated the importance of the fact that it was a five to four decision. Again, not that most voters are analyzing Supreme Court decisions super closely or whatever, but this was clear... A five four decision. Most of these big decisions are... Roe v. Wade was seven two. A little broader spectrum, you might say, of justices, and it was entirely a court... Well, there of the five were put on the court by Donald Trump in the last four years, so it was sort of not like the court has been moving in this direction for quite a while, and there were some appointees of Obama and some of Bush, who were kind of on board, and this is... You can dislike the decision, or you can say, as people do to other decisions, ""This was an overreach,"" but it would sort of have a certain kind of grudging legitimacy, you might say. Whereas here, it just... If you were already inclined to distrust the court, distrust the way some of these judges got on, distrust then, as you say, the attempt to impose this as an overturn of a 49-year-old precedent by a five four decision with three judges who were appointed in the last four years, I think that just compound..."
b_ipkrQ-rGF,6505,Bill Galston,"But I'll tell a self-centered story about 1988. Good. It was June of 1988. If memory serves, Dukakis was up on George H.W. Bush by about 17 points in June. Then out of the blue, and I'd been talking about my skepticism privately with Democrats, so out of the blue I get a call from the late sainted David Broder. He let off, as with his usual Midwestern bluntness, ""Hey, Galston, I hear you're the only Democrat in town who doesn't think this is in the bag for Dukakis."" And I said, ""You heard, right?"" He said, ""Would you tell me why on the record?"" And I did. And I was not a bit surprised when H.W. won the election going away, but for the Democratic party, as a whole, it was a third shock. This sort of plays into my law of threes, that for parties who are entrenched in a bad position, it usually takes three national election losses to convince them that something has gone seriously wrong. That was true for the Democrats. It was true for the Labor Party in the UK. They needed to lose three consecutive elections. Then it was true from the Tories who needed to lose three consecutive elections. So I do think... and back up. This is what the lawyers call an argument against interest."
U46A2ZQmUjL,4737,Ray Takeyh,"So he's in a position where he's a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in history of Britain. But he became a prime minister, came Suez, and he's discredited. Ali Khamenei, if he had died at age 83, he would be remembered as one of the Middle East's greatest revolutionaries. He helped defeat America and Iraq. He helped surround Israel with rings of fire. He brought the nuclear program to a point where it was elaborate and on the cusp of detonation. He had consolidated the regime and more importantly, consolidated its revolutionary values. Today, that obituary cannot be redeemed. Today, there's a big footnote in there saying, ""But..."" So his authority is going to diminish, and the regime will have to, assuming it survives, recalibrate the elite structure. In Western lexicon, the civil-military relations, the civil-military balance of power is likely to have tilted toward the military and whatever's left of it. Interesting. I mean, it is kind of amazing. I want to ask you in a minute whether that would make it more radical or less, but I also want to say, I mean, I guess it's easy to say these things after the fact."
ugKvVGynd2L,4670,Ray Takeyh,"I mean- The events of past week could not have happened if the events in Lebanon had not happened. Yeah. Say a word about that. That's the word I think. Well, it's- It's one of the deterrents was this ring of circle around Israel, right? That could cause so much damage. The idea that Hezbollah missile force could destroy Haifa. The idea that given the geographic proximity, Hezbollah's vast arsenal of projectiles didn't have to travel far. And essentially it had the entire Israeli society as a hostage. Once that front was disabled, and it was disabled with imagination and alacrity, once something happened that nobody thought would happen, Nasrallah was buried in his bunker. Because previously the argument was however bad Nasrallah is, and you're hearing this argument about Khamenei, however bad Nasrallah is, he kept Hezbollah intact and he can be counted on to be pragmatic because he has learned lessons of 2006 about messing with Israel, and even when he was having rings of fire during the Hamas crisis, he wasn't fully intervening. And that dispersed Hezbollah into various militias will be more of a security problem for Israel than a cohesive Hezbollah by a leader that has experience dealing with the state of Israel. Once the Israelis- This is an argument made by some in Israel and some in the West, right?"
MAb9JQc4BBr,4430,Ray Takeyh,"Well, those voices are going to come back in the deliberations of the state and say, ""If we had the bomb, we wouldn't be getting bombed."" And the dangerous aspect of this is that the Iranian nuclear program, whatever is left of it, is likely to be a clandestine one now. The Islamic Republic will probably no longer try to reconstitute a large civilian nuclear program, big plants in Natanz and so forth. It will try to have a surreptitious one with a purpose of detonation with alacrity. That's the argument that they got to be making. Now, that argument has to be made in the context where their intelligence services are penetrated, their scientific establishment is beset, their Atomic Energy Organization building is destroyed, and there's a possibility of intervention given that air defenses have not been constituted. But that's the argument that he will hear from the right. From the left, his misjudgments would be viewed as different. And from the population, his misjudgments would be different. They would be criticizing him for his ruinous policies that has essentially destroyed this country. So he's in a position where he's a man without the constituency. Ali Khamenei is a lot like, he will be offended by this, Anthony Eden, the British Prime Minister. If Anthony Eden had never become a prime minister, he will be viewed as one of the greatest foreign secretaries in history of Britain."
P2Q9JdxLNNo,4570,Ray Takeyh,"And speaking of leadership, what about the supreme leader who's, what is he? 86 years old, and- 86 years old, yeah. Assuming he physically survives because there are reports that his life could be targeted, was considered a target, assuming he survives. And there is actually a problem with killing a national leader. It is a legally dubious proposition. This is not Nasrallah. He's a leader of a recognized sovereign government. It's generally not a good idea to commission the assassination of national leaders. That has to be said as a preamble to this conversation. If he survives, he will not be supreme. He may be a leader, but he will not be supreme because his cascade of miscalculations have led Iran into this position. By the way, he will have critics on the left, more importantly, on the right. On the right, there will be those who will say to him, and they did say, in the aftermath of October 7th, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the rules of the game are different now. Israel will approach the Middle East differently than it has in the past. And you saw their intervention in the Gaza Strip. Subsequently, obviously Hezbollah. There were voices within the Revolutionary Guards, we know that by their publications that were saying, ""If the Israelis have changed the rules of the game, then we should change the rules of our game."
vmRwRSIBV4s,5033,Ray Takeyh,"It could go very dangerously. He could finally concede that we're going to build a nuclear weapon, we're going to do whatever we have to do. And also we are going to see, once the population takes account of this, right now the people are leaving their homes from the cities, they're leaving their home from Tehran, once they come back and recalibrate their lives and take accountancy of all this, how they will react to the next regime outrage. And there's always another regime outrage. So that the notion of how this will sort out for the Iranian politics is a post-crisis situation, is a post-crisis development, that's when you see it. But we're still very much in middle of a crisis, or at the beginning of a crisis or a beginning of the beginning of crisis, I don't know where we are. But that's kind of what you look for to see what kind of a regime can actually limp out of this, if any. And there's another online possibility of a simple military coup by the Revolutionary Guards against the civilian leadership. I don't see that happening because they're very much intertwined. They require religious sanction for their violence. That's just the way... They're revolutionaries. The Soviets kept talking about Lenin and all that, Karl Marx and Engel and all that nonsense because they may not have understood it, but they needed those foundational text to justify their misrule."
bLMRPxs2oRf,20346,Anne Applebaum,"I don't actually like it when all of our friends spend too much time making fun of him for all this stuff. I'm not saying he's doing this purposely and it's a brilliant four-dimensional chess thing, but it sort of conceals the true, as you say, the really sustained and pretty systematic threat to the rule of law, the institutions, the norms that he's perfectly happy to carry out and pretty conscious that he's carrying out. Right? He's pretty conscious. And a really telling thing was said to me recently by a Russian journalist I know who's now in exile, who said to me that in the Kremlin ... And this will take a minute to explain, okay? In the Kremlin, they talk about Trump as the American Gorbachev, by which they don't mean leader of the free democracy and blah. Blah. Blah. They mean he's the person who will take the system down, because in the Kremlin, the current Kremlin, they remember Gorbachev as the person who destroyed the Soviet Union. And so now, they're betting that Trump will be the person who destroys the United States, whether he makes it ungovernable, whether he assaults the institution, so that they no longer function, whether he creates so much division and chaos that the US can't have a foreign policy anymore."
jKfkDmaYylG,18921,Anne Applebaum,"I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have. And so there could come a point when he doesn't want to do it anymore. I mean, there's another additional piece of this, which is this war is over when the Russians leave, and it doesn't matter why they leave, they can leave because they lost a battle. They can leave because they are tired. They can leave for economic reasons. And one of the things that's actually happening as we're speaking is that the G7 is meeting, and at the G7, there are going to be a number of things announced. Some have already been leaked, that will increase pressure on Russia. So there will be money that was Russian assets that were frozen at the beginning of the war. The interest from those assets is going to be used essentially to give $50 billion to Ukraine. Also, there's new sanctions on not just Russian companies, but companies that are enabling Russian companies to get around sanctions, especially concerning the rebuilding of their military industrial complex."
e_xOe_JBuoQ,18308,Anne Applebaum,"The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian. The people living on it are put in concentration camps. I mean, there's a horrific story that came out in the FT, in the Financial Times in the last few days, describing how the Russian plan to kidnap Ukrainian children, bring them to Russia, Russify them and put them up for adoption, was actually created before the war. And the FT actually found advertisements, I mean essentially offering Ukrainian children up for adoption inside Russia. So they will lose their children, they will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life. They'll probably lose their businesses because Russia nationalizes whatever businesses it finds in occupied territory. So for them, an occupation is the imposition of a totalitarian regime, and they can't live there, it will be the end. So they will keep fighting. And for Russia, it remains a war of choice. I mean, it remains something they don't have to do. It's a war that's being fought largely now for the sake of Putin's ego and for both his belief in some recreation of some kind of Russian Empire, but also it's his battle against the idea of democracy and the idea that a country like Ukraine can choose what kind of government it wants to have."
x1uW8JCIBhb,18115,Anne Applebaum,"And the cleanliness and stability of dictatorship. You can hear that in the American political debate. And that's not necessarily Russian influence, that's Americans talking like Russians. I think some of it is also influencing them, even the Christian nationalism stuff and all that. I wonder if Putin... He didn't need us to teach him about that given Russian history and European history and history in general. But, the degree to which you can appropriate these religious traditions and symbols and hijack it, or distort it as a supporting populist authoritarian nationalism. I don't know. No. No. This was a kind of co-invention. The American far-right and Putin together invented this idea of some kind of pure white Christian state. In the case of Russia, to be clear, it's absurd. It's not a white, Christian country, it's actually a multinational state. It's some very large percentage, maybe as high as 10 or 12%, Muslim. It's very high divorce rate. Nobody goes to church. Nobody's read the Bible. It's very much not a Christian state. And yet Putin uses this language, both somewhat for internal reasons, but also for external reasons to appeal to the American far right, to appeal to some dictatorships in Africa and elsewhere, also who use this kind of language of traditionalism or traditional culture as a way of dividing the public and fending off people who want to talk about transparency in the rule of law."
FHyk12zKTjK,19163,Anne Applebaum,"But Ukraine has recovered from the very low point of three or so months ago when they didn't have the prospects of war aid and they were really beginning to lose ground. So I would say on the ground, that's where we are. I suppose for all these reasons, including the new uses of technology or the new technologies, it's a little unpredictable actually, if things might break in one direction or another, but I guess, am I right that the safer prediction or assumption is not huge changes in the balance of power or balance of forces on the ground over the next several months? So people are thinking that not much will change this year. The key event, of course, is the US election in November, and it's possible that different decisions will be made depending on who wins that. And then most think that by next year, the cost to the Russian economy, which is being paid in other ways too, will begin to become high enough that Putin will have to start thinking about how long he wants to keep this going. The Ukrainians will keep it going because they don't have a choice. So as far as they're concerned, it's an existential war. I mean, they have to fight because when they lose territory, the territory becomes Russian."
TpyIn3eHfL3,13323,John Bolton,"Well, I think we will have crises because I think some of them are just incapable of showing good sense. Again, this fellow who's the acting US attorney in the district has been sending letters to medical journals, questioning what they're writing about the various diseases. The argument being this could be fraud or corruption of some kind. This isn't going to go very far. Trump's executive orders against the law firms where they have been challenged, where law firms haven't given in, have uniformly been struck down. And I think we'll see whether a number of the other executive orders he's trying to float don't find the same fate. Again, it looks like Trump is succeeding in a wide variety of areas. The litigation is slow to catch up because that's the way the courts operate, but I think it's justice itself that's going to find it harder and harder to do the kinds of things Trump pushed his lawyers in private practice to do. And you think the administration ultimately more or less yields to these court decisions? Well, if they don't, then we will have a constitutional crisis. There's no doubt about it. I think the courts have been pretty restrained, frankly, in the way they've approached this. There are plenty of places where you could see contempt citations being administered, but the courts are building a record because they know every time they do it, it will be appealed."
O6HnWPBRBU_,12404,John Bolton,"Secretary of Defense and we respect, I think, have intervened at times in the Dick Cheney and Bob Gates and military promotions a bit to change the panel some to reward some new thinking or whatever, but it feels like Hegseth and his team want to go way beyond that. On the other end, there's also been a lot of disarray. So just give me your sense of DOD. Well, I think there is a lot of concern on the military side and the civilian side. I think that's right. I think Hegseth's performance has been so far below expectations that despite some initial moves like removing the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and like taking pictures off the walls and things like that of former secretaries of defense, which is just silly and I think regarded as silly, there hasn't been as much disruption as there might've been. Now, there are things that are coming that are not good. I don't think the military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, which coincidentally is the anniversary of the formation of the Army is a good idea. It didn't happen in the first term, although Trump talked about it a lot, and I think that was a good thing for the country. It will not be a good thing to have this parade."
shVvQiPDq2i,12367,John Bolton,"So Vought and Miller are very powerful. Is your general sense, again, as you've talked to a lot of people who are in there and very close to it, people on the Hill, I want to get back to that in a minute. A sense that they are powerful also in terms of compared to the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, traditionally very powerful figures in a cabinet. Is that your sense this time around? I think that we'll have to see now as Elon Musk's influence fades, and I don't think he's going to be doing a day or two a week at the White House. I think when somebody goes, they go, they may come back once a month or something, and I think that means the DOGE operation, to the extent it still exists hidden somewhere in the executive office of the president will also see its influence diminish. But that may be an opening for Russ Vought, that he will take over that job. But overall, I think more and more decisions will be made in the White House and fewer decisions in the cabinet in the second Trump term than in recent presidencies. I think that's the clear message going ahead. Because I think people will be afraid to do something that might front run Trump and make a decision that he doesn't want to make."
IhJ_6uH_VvU,13918,John Bolton,"I just hope it's not as bad as it looks right now, and I hope we are able to repair it when Trump is gone. But this is purely gratuitous. It is a completely self-inflicted wound. That's really eloquent and powerful and a little chilling, honestly. I mean, I hope we can repair it also, but it's also how much damage he's done at 100 and whatever we're now at, 10 days or something, less than that, I guess. With 1,300 days or something left, I mean, one assumes that this was the shock and awe period and there's some version almost to the mean or some checking or some rethinking or some mugged-by-reality moments here where he comes back but can also spiral a little out of control, right? And that's what I guess alarms me the most. You just don't know how much strain... We're putting a lot of strain on allies and structures and arrangements that one hopes can... They've been around a long time, they can hold up some, but can they hold up throughout? That's the question, I suppose. Well, it is, and we're not acting alone here. If you're in Beijing looking at this, you're sitting around saying, ""How are we going to take advantage of what Trump is doing on Taiwan, on the South China Sea, on a range of other issues?"" And other rogue states like North Korea are thinking the same, which is why how Trump handles the Iranian nuclear weapons program could be so important."
gNOdAFBfF8u,12966,John Bolton,"I think if Steve Feinberg could clean up defense department procurement, you could speed up the delivery of weapons systems. You could save billions of dollars, all of which you could then plow back into the defense budget and there's an enormous amount of work to do. John Lehman who was Reagan's secretary of the Navy, said some years ago, ""The way to solve the procurement problem at DOD is take all the armed procurement regulations, take all the board of contract appeals decisions, take all the court cases, put them in a big pile in the Pentagon parking lot and burn them."" And I think that's basically about right. So if Feinberg can do that, if he can help make the personnel selection process more efficient in the military, if the service secretaries really do their jobs in an efficient way, if they bring some of what they've learned in business to help make the services more effective, that could all be good and let Hegseth do pushups in the morning with the troops and testify on Congress and things like that. There's a lot to do over there and there may yet be a chance it can happen. Where I think the biggest failing is occurring, and it just happened this week, is in the White House where the defense budget, it looked to be over a trillion dollars request for the next fiscal year, but as Roger Wicker from Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee pointed out it included 150 billion that he had added to Biden's budget just in the past few months."
