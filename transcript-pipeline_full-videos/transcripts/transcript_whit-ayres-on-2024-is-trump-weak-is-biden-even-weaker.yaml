      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very glad to be joined again today by my
      old friend, Whit Ayers, the head of North Star Opinion Research, one of the most well-respected
      Republican, but also non-political opinion polling firms in the country, and also a real strategist
      who’s been involved in many Republican campaigns from presidential, to governor and senator. Good
      time to be talking also because the South Carolina primer is coming up. Whit, I don’t know if you
      were born there, but you started off in South Carolina? You were a student there and a professor
      there, if I’m not mistaken, and a budget director there. Did I make that up? I think that’s right.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      I actually taught eighth grade in Greenville in an earlier era, eighth grade civics and history.
      Toughest job I ever had. And then I—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      They could use more of that civics and history, there and elsewhere, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      That’s right. And then I was on the faculty at the University of South Carolina, Department of
      Government and International Studies, and then I was on the governor’s staff under Carroll Campbell
      as his budget and policy director. So, I spent a lot of time in South Carolina.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And you’ve done races there, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yes, we have. Starting with Carroll Campbell.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. He was a good governor. Yeah. Different era though.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      David Beasley and a number of others in South Carolina over the years.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So we’re talking on February 1st. We last spoke at the end of August after the first Republican
      debate, I think. And of course, no voting had taken place. We’ve seen Iowa, we’ve seen New
      Hampshire. We now have a two-person race. Many people thought it would take longer to get to that.
      We have the results from Iowa and New Hampshire, we have polling from South Carolina. Where are we
      just as a kind of analytical matter in this Republican primary contest?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Well, we are right where we have been, which is that Donald Trump is a strong favorite to win the
      Republican nomination. Nikki Haley is making a good run and hanging in there. I think it’s important
      to realize that most presidential campaigns don’t end because the candidate believes they would not
      be particularly good in the office, or they have no chance. Most campaigns end because they run out
      of money. And at least since the New Hampshire primary and Donald Trump’s less than gracious victory
      speech that night, apparently Nikki Haley has been able to raise a lot of money, enough money to
      keep going, at least through South Carolina and maybe through Super Tuesday. But of course, the
      reality is that Donald Trump remains the odds-on favorite to win the nomination.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You know I remember before New Hampshire, I thought we discussed this not in the conversation, but
      just in our own private conversations, that Haley probably had to get within 10 points, maybe even
      make it really close in New Hampshire to sort of really stay alive. She lost by 11, but she’s a
      little more viable than I would’ve expected. Maybe it’s because of Trump’s lack of graciousness and
      the speech, which probably had more effect than I realized, watching on primary night. Maybe it’s
      because they really… I don’t know if she’s just hanging in there, or maybe it’s because of the
      voters, maybe it’s more impressive than people out there think that now consistently Trump’s not
      been able to break… What, he got 51 in Iowa, 55 in New Hampshire? Trump is the overwhelming
      favorite, obviously, but it feels like it’s a little more of a race than I would’ve expected, I
      guess. Do you think that’s right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah. He’s a quasi-incumbent, and some 40 to 45% of Republican primary voters are voting for
      somebody else. This is not exactly a sign of overwhelming dominance when you’ve got almost half the
      party at least interested in an alternative. But of course, he remains the favorite. But it does
      cross my mind if he had said what I’m sure Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wanted him to say after
      the New Hampshire primary, something similar to what he said after Iowa, “I congratulate Nikki Haley
      on a well-run race, but this primary is over and it’s time to join forces and unite the party
      against Joe Biden.” Instead, he went on this angry rant because Nikki Haley refused to bend the
      knee, and it reminded all the people who are not for Trump why they’re not for him. It was really an
      incredibly missed opportunity on the part of the Trump campaign, I thought.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. And do you think to the degree he keeps that up, it does help Haley at least somewhat,
      right? That sort of—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Sure. He did not get a single vote on the primary night in New Hampshire that he didn’t already
      have, and he reminded everybody who wasn’t for him why they didn’t want him in the first place. It
      was not an impressive performance.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And in the Washington Post poll this morning on February 1st, it’s Washington Post-Monmouth, 58-32
      for Trump, which is a little— if you’re for Haley, or prefer Haley, or want Trump to be stopped it’s
      a 26-point margin. But it feels to me like when you see a number like that with Trump, who as you
      say is a virtual incumbent, and maybe 58-32 ends up being more like, I don’t know, 58-42 at a final
      ballot. One doesn’t know, obviously, and there are questions of who can vote in the Republican
      primary, like New Hampshire. It is pretty open in South Carolina.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      It is open, it’s an open primary.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      If you haven’t voted in the Democratic primary, which is this Saturday, you have the right to vote.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Right. But they don’t register by party. South Carolina has changed a lot over the last 10 or 15
      years. It’s one of the 10 fastest growing states in the country. About 500,000 more people live in
      South Carolina today than did in 2010. Huge growth in Horry County along the coasts, Myrtle Beach,
      also the suburbs south of Charlotte have been booming, and Greenville is an unrecognizable town to
      those of us who saw it a half century ago. So, it really is a growing state, but it’s also clearly a
      very conservative state, and it’s the kind of state where Donald Trump ought to do well, and
      probably will.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, if you look at the breakdowns of the likely Republican primary electorate, but the caveat
      we’re not sure what that electorate is, it feels like it’s sort of between Iowa and New Hampshire in
      terms of evangelicals, how many people self-identify as very conservative and so forth, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      That’s correct.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But people do think it’s a little more conservative than it is. It’s not like the state didn’t elect
      Nikki Haley and Carroll Campbell, that was a little while ago. And for that matter, Lindsey Graham
      and Tim Scott who, what everyone thinks of some of their behavior recently, are not far right MAGA
      Republicans really, or present themselves since then.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      They did not run as far right wing crazy candidates, which is one reason why they won.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Speaking of, one more word on, just having mentioned Tim Scott. How much does it matter that the
      Republican establishment is so almost uniformly, preemptively capitulated to Trump? If Tim Scott had
      stayed out of it or had, well, endorsed Haley but even just said, “look, I’m neutral. I respect them
      both.” Would that give a little more oomph to the notion that it’s not foreordained that it has to
      be Trump? Would it make Trump a little more of a pure MAGA candidate and a little less of the
      candidate of everyone, from his MAGA loyalists all the way through Tim Scott, and the kind of
      mainstream Republicans on the hill? Do you think that matters much or do people just not pay
      attention to those endorsements?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Well, South Carolina has always been sort of an establishment state. Carroll Campbell helped win the
      state for Bob Dole in 1996, for example. So, the establishment has always played a significant role
      there. In some ways, it sort of plays into Nikki Haley’s whole mantra though, that she’s the
      outsider running against the good old boy network. That’s the way she ran in 2010 when she beat the
      incumbent attorney general, now the governor, the incumbent lieutenant governor, and an incumbent
      congressman from the most conservative part of the state. And she won that race going away by
      running against the good old boys. So, in some ways, it plays into her message, but it’s still a
      very high hill to climb once you get everybody on board with Donald Trump.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And maybe that’s well said. Last sort of tactical question or South Carolina focused question. What
      would she need, in your opinion to keep going credibly through Michigan and then Super Tuesday and
      sort of say that, “no, if Trump’s at this number and I’m at this number, it’s still a competition,”
      or have people say, “no, it can’t really go on.”
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Money in the bank. That’s what she needs.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And what number do you think in the results translates into money in the bank? Or is it just hard to
      say?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      I don’t know. I’m surprised that she’s been able to raise as much money as she has. Clearly Donald
      Trump’s effort to bully donors into not giving to her, backfired. When you’re a billionaire, it is
      kind of tough to bully somebody who’s got a billion dollars. And some of them obviously resented
      Trump’s effort to bully them and upped their donations to Nikki Haley. So, what she needs is enough
      money in the bank to keep going more than any particular number on the ballot.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I feel like 40 though… It’s kind of nice to be in the 40s, not the 30s, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      She said she’d like to do better than New Hampshire, and she did 43 in New Hampshire, so we’ll see
      if she can meet that bar.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And then [inaudible] I can’t resist a little bit more of the tactical stuff. It’s just interesting
      to people like us. It would be great if we had a wide open, exciting nine-way primary of the kinds
      that we’ve seen— five-way or that we’ve seen in the past, but this is the primary we have. So, what
      do you think? Everyone says, “well, she can’t win a state,” and stuff. Don’t you think if she can,
      let’s say get 42, I’m just making this up, and then stays in, gets something like that in Michigan,
      maybe goes to Super Tuesday, then everyone says, “she couldn’t possibly. She won’t win a state.” I
      don’t know. Is that true? Couldn’t she win Virginia here, for example? I feel like she could win two
      or three states. She probably still has to get out at that point because then you would have
      overwhelming, if less things change, delegate numbers, right? They would just be pretty lopsided.
      But I feel like the notion that Trump’s going to win all 50 states, I’m not so sure about that.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah, I think she could win a state or two or three here or there. The problem is California,
      because California is winner take all, and they have jimmied the rules in a way that really helps
      whoever comes in first, and that’s likely to be Donald Trump. And California has such a mountain of
      delegates that it would create an almost insurmountable lead once we get through California.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And that’s not Super Tuesday, California. So, we could have numbers the day after Super Tuesday on
      TV that will show Trump with whatever, five to one leading delegates, and it would look pretty…
      Yeah. Well, we’ll see. I don’t know. Well, how much damage? Is this doing some damage to Trump, just
      the fact that she’s able to stay in and sort of demonstrating a little more strength than people
      might’ve expected two or three months ago, or will it sort of be forgotten once Trump wraps up
      denomination if he does, and we’re onto the Trump-Biden race?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      It shows what we’ve known all along. That is a minority of the Republican Party that’s really
      resistant to Trump. And it’s that minority that tends to say that if he is convicted of a crime,
      they will vote elsewhere. A majority of Republicans would stick with Trump even if he were convicted
      of a felony. But we’ve seen numbers pretty consistently that about twenty-five percent of
      Republicans would simply not vote for him if he were convicted. In a polarized age, you need 90% or
      more of your own party in order to be competitive, and if you drop that down into the mid 70s,
      that’s a problem. It’s not that they’re going to vote for Joe Biden necessarily. Some of them will,
      but more would look to a third-party candidate or write in somebody. Some of them would do what a
      lot of voters did in Georgia in 2020, and that is skip the presidential ballot and then vote down
      ballot for Republicans, which is why the Republicans could all win in Georgia in 2020 down ballot
      while Trump lost the state.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Except in the Senate races, which Trump managed to turn into a Trump race, not a normal down ballot
      race, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Exactly, and some just wouldn’t vote. So, if Trump gets convicted before November, that’s going to
      be a problem, to wrap up the number of Republican votes as well as independent votes he needs to win
      the election.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Say a little more just about the numbers here. People might be skeptical also that some of
      those Republicans are saying they’re not going to vote for Trump and then they’ll revert to him at
      the end. But you’ve looked at these numbers pretty closely, I know in New Hampshire, and now there
      are numbers in the post-poll in South Carolina where they do push the question pretty hard. I think
      a poll you did of not just, “gee, would you be unhappy if he’s convicted of a crime?” Because you
      could be unhappy and still vote for him. But, “would you actually have problems voting for him?”
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah. The exit polls ask a question, do you think he would be fit for office if he were convicted of
      a crime? And you get a pretty significant number who say, “yes, he would be unfit for office.” But
      that’s not the real question. The real question is, would you vote for a man who has been convicted
      or would you vote for a man who’s 82 years old, whom Republicans think is senile? That’s the real
      question, and that’s the question we’ve asked. “Who would you vote for if Donald Trump were
      convicted of a crime?” And that’s where you get the 75% of Republicans saying, “yes, they would
      still vote for him against Biden,” but 25% going elsewhere.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And of that 25%, half maybe go to Biden and the other half just want something else? Or not even
      half to Biden?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      No. About 7% go to Biden, about 11% go to third party. The rest scatter in saying they either won’t
      vote or they’ll skip the presidential ballot and vote in down ballot races.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So really, the trials is one big thing out there that could affect people’s judgments, and I suppose
      not just the conviction itself, but the prospect of conviction as the trials start, if they ever do
      start. That’s a question we should get the lawyers to discuss.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      It’s not just the prospect of conviction. If he goes to trial and is not found guilty, that is if
      he’s acquitted by just one juror out of 12 saying I’m not convicting, then he’ll think it’s all
      over. It just plays right into his whole argument that this is a partisan witch hunt. I think it’s
      the outcome of the trial that is absolutely crucial. The testimony is, well, who comes out and who
      testifies, but it’s fundamentally the outcome. If he is acquitted, it’s all over, it looks like a
      partisan witch hunt, but if he’s convicted, I think we’re in another world.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The one trial that looks, I think maybe is still likely to happen in 2024, is the DC trial on
      January 6th, which could have Mike Pence testifying and other interesting things. Certainly it will
      be very high profile won’t it. It’s funny, we usually analyze these campaigns and it’s all campaign
      tactics, will this issue be bigger or if there’s a foreign policy crisis, would that help McCain
      against Obama, all the usual stuff that for a few days people focus on, which tends to fade
      actually. I think you would agree with this, I think you’ve argued this, that the underlying
      dynamics of the race reassert themselves after a little bit of a blip, someone has a bad debate,
      he’s up two or three points, then it goes back to where the race wanted to be all along, so to
      speak. You think the trial really is a different category than having a bad debate or—?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Oh yeah. Is Mark Meadows going to testify? He’s been awfully quiet. You’ve got to actually get to a
      trial and this latest brouhaha over whether the president has absolute immunity, I can’t imagine
      going Trump’s way, but it has caused more delay in the trial and the classified documents trial is,
      from a legal standpoint, I think, the strongest of all of them, but you have a much more Trump
      sympathetic judge in Aileen Cannon, Fort Pierce Florida jury is likely to be more sympathetic to
      Trump, but the actual facts of the case are pretty devastating. They didn’t charge Trump for any
      classified documents that he voluntarily returned, just like they didn’t charge Biden or Pence on
      any classified documents they voluntarily returned. They only charged him on those documents he hid,
      not just from the government, but from his own attorney so that your attorney couldn’t tell the
      government he had classified documents. That is a pretty powerful case, that you refused to return
      classified documents when asked and pressed for them. It’s a pretty tough legal argument to get away
      from, I think, but who knows if that will go to trial. I mean, that could be pushed out past the
      November election.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it looks like Judge Cannon is doing that and, without impugning her motives, it’s certainly
      helpful to Trump to push it past the election, so he may owe Judge Cannon big time if he wins this
      election.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      A Supreme Court seat baby. There you go.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Can you imagine? God. One hears two different things and I think both are somewhat true. I’m curious
      how you weigh them in the balance. Trump’s had a pretty disciplined campaign, really on some issues,
      at least. His team seems pretty confident. It doesn’t seem quite as chaotic as it was in 2016 and of
      course you don’t have the pandemic, thank God, so far, so you don’t have the 2020 kind of craziness.
      On the one hand, they know what they’re doing. On the other hand, the election night speech in New
      Hampshire, some of the other stuff that Trump and his close allies are doing and pushing, seems a
      little self-indulgent, let’s say and maybe Trump’s a little more that way than he was before. That’s
      sort of what Nikki Haley’s been saying, I supported him in the past, but he’s not as grounded or
      he’s more chaotic and somewhat confused. Which of these two is more true. Are you more impressed by
      Trump as a candidate or think that six to eight months of Trump as a candidate, if he sows it up,
      let’s say on March 5th? He may lose. Everyone knows him. It won’t be a massive movement based on
      some speech you get or some stumble he makes or some insult he hurls, but do you think he gains a
      point or two because of the discipline of the campaign or loses a point or two because of him being
      Trump?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Well, there’s no question that Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita know what they’re doing. I’ve worked
      with them both. They’re good, solid professional operatives, but controlling Donald Trump is a
      fool’s errand. He seems to have some difficulty controlling himself like we saw on the night of the
      New Hampshire primary. Who knows what he’s going to do or say over the course of an eight month
      campaign. I don’t know, I don’t think they know and I’m pretty sure Donald Trump doesn’t know. It’s
      a much more disciplined campaign, but seeing Trump in the spotlight as a potential president again
      for eight months may not necessarily work in his favor.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Even if it only moves a point or two or three, that’s important.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah, this thing’s on a knife’s edge. It’s not at the moment. It’s not at the moment. If this
      election were held today, Donald Trump would win in a landslide in the electoral college. I mean,
      it’s pretty clear right now, but that’s a function of Biden’s weakness rather than Trump’s strength.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Let’s get to President Biden since these races are about two or more candidates, not about one. I’d
      say among Biden friends, Biden fans with whom I speak, Biden supporters, there’s a little bit more
      optimism now than there was a month or two ago. A couple of national polls look decent. You’re not a
      believer in that, so talk about it.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      There’s no reason for the Biden forces to feel more optimistic today. The poll that came out today,
      Bloomberg Morning Consult, Wisconsin, Trump up 8, Nevada, Trump up 12, Michigan, Trump up 6,
      Georgia, Trump up 7, North Carolina, Trump up 13, Arizona, Trump up 8, Pennsylvania, trump up 3.
      Trump would win in a landslide in the electoral college if the election were held today and the
      reason is, that Joe Biden is the weakest American president since Jimmy Carter and there’s some
      similarity between the two men. Both of them defeated weakened Republican incumbents. Gerald Ford,
      in the case of Jimmy Carter, who was very unpopular after he pardoned Nixon and Biden defeated Trump
      after a chaotic first term, but both have conducted themselves in a way that has led a majority of
      Americans to disapprove of their job performance and Biden is starting to get that Carter feel. By
      that I mean, that the world is coming apart and he seems incapable of affecting events in any sort
      of positive way and that was the feeling people started to get about Jimmy Carter after the Iranian
      hostage crisis, that he just was incapable of affecting events. You’re starting to get that feel
      with Joe Biden too, that he is just unable to affect events in a positive way, whether it’s Ukraine
      or immigration or the Middle East. It just feels like events are out of control and Biden is a
      bystander watching events spin out of control. Once that perception settles in, it becomes
      incredibly difficult to change it and I’ve seen nothing over the last few months to change that
      perception about Joe Biden. I mean, he’s got two huge vulnerabilities, in addition to the foreign
      policy crisis and the crisis with the border and the economy that people don’t think is any good.
      The most important one is the vast majority of Americans, including a vast majority of Democrats,
      think he’s just too old to serve effectively, in his mid ’80s in the most difficult job in the
      world. The second vulnerability is that virtually no one in either party thinks that Kamala Harris
      is ready for prime time. The White House is fond of saying, well, a lot can change in the course of
      eight months. Well, that’s true, but what won’t change is Joe Biden is not going to get any younger,
      any more physically vigorous or any sharper mentally and Kamala Harris is not going to get any more
      ready to be president of the United States. There’s nothing they can do about either one and it’s
      amazing to me that Democrats at this point have gone along so meekly and I wonder how much longer
      they’re going to continue to go along with a ticket that looks like a sure loser in the fall.

      They’ll tell themselves it’s not a sure loser, that will be the reason for continuing to go along
      maybe, right? There’s an awful lot of “hopium” on the democratic side.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      “Hopium,” that’s a good phrase.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, I didn’t invent it, but—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Also, known as whistling past the graveyard.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, maybe. I want to get to the age thing and how they all relate in a way, these things and then
      talk about what the implications are for the next eight months, but I think the bystander point’s an
      important point that people don’t grasp enough. There’s sort of a tendency to analyze this. Well on
      this issue, he’s unpopular, that’s the way the posters typically ask it, right? Do you agree with
      the Democrats or the Republicans or with Biden on immigration, on the economy? Do you approve of his
      job performance on Russia and Ukraine or the economy or immigration or whatever. That’s important,
      but voters don’t quite think of it that way, I think, and I do think that the notion that he’s just
      a bystander, you don’t want a president who’s just a bystander, is important. I think the other
      presidents who won reelection, people didn’t agree with them often on many issues actually and they
      knew they’d made mistakes, but there was a sense that they were kind of on top of things, I think
      it’s fair to say and that they were controlling things, each in their own different style. Reagan
      was different from Obama, obviously. Bush was different from his father, well, his father lost. Bush
      was different from Clinton, let’s say, but there was a sense in each case, I think, that they were
      running the government and sort of on top of events and controlling events to some degree. I’m
      struck by the bystander point. I mean, this is a small issue, not a small issue, but maybe a small
      example. This Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan package and then the border deal and they’re combining them,
      and they may not combine them. People like me follow it and most people don’t, I presume and this
      four months back and forth and nothing’s happened yet, but I am struck how much of… You read these
      articles and it’s, Mitch McConnell thinks this, and Jim Lankford’s tried to put the deal together,
      but so-and-so Speaker Johnson’s against it. It’s like, isn’t there a president? I mean, doesn’t he
      have something to say about… Can’t he use some muscle to rally public opinion and get stuff to
      happen on one thing that’s a very important priority for him, Ukraine, and another the border where
      he’s had to change his position because it’s rightly or wrongly, he’s viewed as ineffectual and
      stuff, but if you’re going to be viewed as ineffectual, you should do something to make yourself not
      viewed that way. I guess I’m just struck by, again, the absence. It’s more than the details of do
      people like this part of the bill or that part of the bill and sort of a “where’s Biden?” problem.
      Do you have that sense too and I think that’s true on Ukraine. Ukraine, he says, is the inflection
      point for the world and then I don’t know, he hasn’t given any major speeches on Ukraine that I know
      of in the last few months.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah, well, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. A discharge petition is hard to get in the house
      over the objection of the speaker, but it’s not impossible if you get all the Democrats and a chunk
      of Republicans who would really like to see a border deal and would really like to see money go to
      Ukraine. It is possible for a gifted president who can affect events to make things happen and
      that’s what I’m talking about. It’s that Jimmy Carter syndrome that he can’t seem to affect events
      in a positive direction, that he’s basically impotent to make things happen and that is a
      devastating perception to settle into the public consciousness. It’s one of the things that allowed
      Reagan to win a landslide victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I suppose the age dovetails with that, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Of course it does. It feeds right into the age, you know? He’s too old to make things happen, is the
      way it’ll get translated.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. He’s done a good job of scaring other Democrats that way from running and of resisting calls
      that he voluntarily step aside. The one-two punch, I guess the one, two, three punch is what you’re
      saying, really, of age, Vice President Harris. Age could be handled somewhat if everyone loved your—
      if you were confident in your vice president, but that’s not the case or if things were going
      swimmingly and people thought things were going swimmingly and you could kind of in effect, I think
      this was Reagan ’84 is a little bit of this, that you could afford to have a president who was a
      little bit going to not be as vigorous as a 55-year-old in his second term, but directionally things
      were going well and he had a very good team with him and he knew what he was doing on the big
      issues, the economy and Soviet Union basically and George Shultz and Jim Baker and others were there
      and people had a vague sense. I’m also struck by that a little. Again, voters don’t focus on who the
      Secretary of State or the Secretary of Treasury is or Chief of Staff, but people had the sense, my
      vague memory is in ’84 that for the — ‘cause there was a lot of chaos in the Reagan administration,
      honestly and in the White House — that there were people, serious people there, who they vaguely
      knew about, who had been in government a long time. I personally respect Janet Yellen and Tony
      Blinken and stuff. They’re not out there the way Shultz and Baker were, right? I mean, Weinberger. I
      was a little struck. They haven’t run the administration in a way that’s allowed the cabinet
      secretaries to give Biden much help.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah. You’re exactly right. That Kamala Harris exacerbates the age problem. It’s true that people
      don’t vote for the vice president. They vote for the top of the ticket. But we’ve seen evidence in
      relatively recent years that people might vote against the top of the ticket because they’re worried
      about the vice president. They vote against the vice president. John McCain lost votes because
      people were worried about putting Sarah Palin one heartbeat away from the presidency. So, people can
      vote against a ticket because of worries about the vice president, even though ultimately, they vote
      for the top of the ticket if it’s a positive vote.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So let’s talk about, let’s assume… Super Tuesday is March 5th. So ,at that point, Biden hasn’t
      pulled out of the race, and has of course won every Democratic primary overwhelmingly. Trump, let’s
      just say, has won the huge majority pretty comfortably and has a massive delegate lead. And so,
      they’re the nominees, even whether Nikki Haley stays in another round or two or three or until the
      end for that matter. But the country sort of wakes up March 6th and says, “Okay, it’s a Trump/Biden
      race.” I mean, it’ll be the longest general election campaign ever with the least wished for
      candidate matchup ever. Is that right? I think that’s right.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Two thirds of Americans absolutely dread the thought of a Trump/Biden rematch, two thirds. And that
      includes a majority of both Democrats and Republicans. And almost 80% of independents want better
      choices. So, who knows what happens. It certainly doesn’t increase belief and trust in our political
      system. I’ve been very skeptical that a third party could be anything more than a spoiler, and I
      still think I’m there. But you have to wonder if it’s two thirds of the country doesn’t want either
      one of these guys, if there might not be the possibility of a third party having more effect than
      they’ve had in the past. I still am skeptical, I’ll have to be convinced. But it just sort of feels
      like there’s a vacuum there that somebody might be able to fill and start tapping into the
      resistance, the widespread resistance to a Trump/Biden rematch.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I’ve been skeptical too, and I guess I remain skeptical that third party would be likely or
      even have an outside chance at winning, maybe a very small chance. But that doesn’t mean someone
      doesn’t get in or some different combinations of people don’t get in in March, April. Everyone knows
      about the No Labels possible ballot line, but it’s not that hard as an independent candidate to get
      on. Maybe it’s a little hard to get in all 50 states, but not hard to get on 40 plus states even if
      you start in May, let alone March or April. You got to think people are looking at that, whether
      they’re retired politicians of both parties, businesspeople, retired military, celebrities,
      entertainers, Schwarzenegger types, Perot types, whatever. I’m thinking, I don’t know, why not take
      a shot? And especially if you’re terrified of a Trump presidency and you just think if it’s not
      Biden, it’s going to be Trump, you would resist that and a lot of my friends would resist that and
      I’d be inclined to too, but that doesn’t mean they would resist it. I guess what I’m saying is I
      feel like even if that person doesn’t win, it could be a Perot type situation where someone gets in,
      does well enough to be qualified for debates if there are debates, gets a lot of press. I don’t know
      which way that cuts. Talk about that.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Depends on who it is. It depends totally on who it is. But it can’t be just one of these gadfly
      candidates. It’d have to be someone of substance, someone of reputation, and someone whom people
      believe could be a credible president of the United States. But if someone like that did decide to
      make a serious run and were very well funded, you suspect they could do a whole lot better than most
      third party candidates have. Ross Perot set the standard in 1992. He got 19% of the popular vote. Of
      course he got zero electoral votes because he couldn’t come up with a majority in any state. And
      that’s the big dilemma for a third party candidate where the electoral college is coming up with
      enough votes to win some electoral votes and you throw it into the house and you’ve got more chaos.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      If he gets electoral votes, yeah. I mean, in ’92, the exit polls suggested that Perot voters said
      that if he hadn’t been running, they would’ve split evenly basically between Bush and Clinton with a
      fair number saying they wouldn’t have voted. But I, having been in that Bush White House at the
      time, I felt Perot did a lot of damage to Bush. I mean, at the end of the day, people can say what
      they want after they vote, but in the dynamics of the campaign, it legitimated this Republican-ish
      or Republican really, Texas business person who had been a huge supporter of veterans and pretty
      conservative, was running on the budget deficit after all, right, I mean appealing, did not look
      like a lefty protest candidate. The fact that this guy was saying Bush is unacceptable, the
      incumbent’s unacceptable and I’m running, reinforced problems we already had in the Bush
      administration of convincing people we deserved a second term, and the end of the Cold War and you
      didn’t need a foreign policy president anymore, all that together. But I think Perot did a lot of
      damage to Bush in the dynamics of the campaign and on the debate stage for that matter.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      You’ll never convince—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I guess that brings home your point about who the independent candidates are.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah, you’ll never convince the George H W Bush forces that Perot did not cost Bush the presidency.
      They’re absolutely convinced that he did.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And so, who’s the incumbent? I mean, that’s one question, right? Is this election going to be a
      referendum on Biden or on Trump?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yes. This is 1892 all over again. This is Grover Cleveland versus Benjamin Harrison, a former
      president versus a current president. And we really haven’t had anything comparable since 1892.
      Grover Cleveland came back and defeated the guy who had beaten him. So, he is our only president to
      serve two terms non-con consecutively. But that’s exactly what Donald Trump is trying to do today. I
      wish we had some exit polls from 1892, it would really inform us today, but that was well before the
      era of public opinion polling, unfortunately.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s right. I actually am going to go read something about… There are historians who have written
      about that period and that election, I’m sure. We all know… What you just said is something one
      knows sort of at the level of the headline, first time since the late 19th century that there’s been
      the two incumbents that are in fact running against each other. And it was a reversal then. But I
      would actually be curious to look at the 1892 rhetoric of that campaign, and how much of it was
      about Harrison’s performance in office and how much of it was about Cleveland’s, I guess, somewhat
      unsatisfactory performance in his first term, which caused him to lose. Obviously, it’s not like
      Trump and it’s not like Biden and all that, but it would be an interesting little hour or two to
      spend reading some American history, I guess.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Grover Cleveland won the Democratic nomination on the first ballot against pretty serious people, a
      former governor, senator from New York, senator from Iowa or governor of Iowa. So pretty serious
      people. But he did win the nomination on the first ballot and go on to defeat the guy who’d beaten
      him.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In ’92, yeah.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      1892.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s interesting. Yeah. That’s my assignment after this is to read up on the 1892 election. But I
      mean, if you were advising the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign, how do they make it more… I
      take it either campaign has to… They’re not going to change their… Trump’s not going to become
      suddenly a favorite of a huge number of independents and Biden’s not going to suddenly become… move
      his presidential approval rating from 40 to 50%. So, how do they make it about the other candidate,
      I mean, as an actual campaign experience, campaign operative? What’s the—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      It’s just all a negative campaign that convinces voters that their guy is the lesser of the two
      evils. It will not be an inspiring campaign that we will look back on fondly, I’m afraid.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And if people see that, don’t you think, in March and April, it increases the chances of a third
      party, unity, bipartisan positive vision for the future next generation candidates?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yep.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The next generation part is important too. I mean, Haley has begun to hit on that. I wonder if they
      have some sense that that’s working or not, but she has an ad up, I think, with both Trump and Biden
      in it, I can’t remember what exactly the punchline is, but it’s time. You don’t want these grumpy
      old men back or something like that. I don’t really know.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      It is a powerful argument that it’s time to move on and that she is the only person standing in the
      way of a Trump/Biden rematch that the vast majority of Americans dread. It’s a good argument. The
      problem is it might work in a general election electorate. The question is whether she can make it
      work in a Republican primary electorate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But I suppose we’ll learn… I mean, it would be in that respect the next month, I mean until Super
      Tuesday, the more independents who go out of their way to vote for Haley in South Carolina or
      Michigan or Virginia or other states, I suppose would be a bit of an indicator of the—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Oh yeah. The independent vote is critical. In 2016, Donald Trump got 46% of the independent vote in
      his victory over Hillary Clinton. In 2020, he got 41% of the independent vote in his loss to Joe
      Biden. And in New Hampshire he got 39% of the independent vote. So at least based on New Hampshire,
      he is not performing at the level among independents that he did in his victory in 2016.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. And I hadn’t really seen that analysis. And the independents we’re talking
      about in New Hampshire, if I’m not mistaken, would be those who chose to vote in the Republican
      primary.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Who are undeclared.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Which included a lot of, what are they called, unaffiliated in New Hampshire, I guess?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Undeclared is what they call them.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And that would include a lot of normal, let’s say, democratic leaning independents who went over to
      vote against Trump. And there was an effort, which I was a little involved in, to encourage people
      to do that. But still, it wouldn’t include a lot of, a fair number of independents who are
      democratic independents. And so that 39 is actually weaker even than it sounds like, in a way, when
      you think about it, right? There’s some other independents out there who just voted for Biden or
      something, or didn’t vote in the primary.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Democrats couldn’t vote in the GOP primary in New Hampshire. They had to change their party
      registration by October six.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The Democratic leaning independents. Some did, but not all, presumably—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      As long as they’re undeclared, they could have voted.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right, but some of them couldn’t quite probably get themselves to do it if they were basically
      Democrats who just registered as undeclared. So, that is a real weakness of Trump. Maybe that’s an
      interesting… I mean people are so… Biden is weak in the ways we’ve said, but I suppose that Trump
      weaknesses may be underestimated a little, do you think, I mean among the sort of…
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Oh, I can make a powerful argument why neither one of those men can win the presidency, but the
      chances are pretty good that one of them is going to.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, this is where you just don’t know how much this sort of system, it has various constraints on
      third parties, and we’ve all had occasions when no one liked the candidate much, but ended up
      choosing between those two candidates mostly. But I think never as much as today. Right? Do you
      agree with that? Never in our lifetime certainly, nothing like this.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Not in our lifetime. We never had a circumstance like this in our lifetime, a former president
      running against a current president, a former president facing 91 felony counts. I mean, there are
      all kinds of completely different dynamics in this race that none of us have ever been through
      before.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Which does make one wonder when, if on March 6th, the whole country wakes up to the realization that
      unless something dramatic happens that we’re now looking at this race that you’ve just described,
      that something dramatic might happen, right? I mean, presumably politics abhors a vacuum and supply
      creates its own demand or whatever cliche one wants that might lead something to happen. I guess,
      just as we talk, I’m a little more convinced of the possibility, not of an independent candidate
      winning the presidency or even winning electoral votes, but of a much more serious independent
      candidate or candidates seriously considering running. I guess I’d put it that way.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah. This election may be decided by events that haven’t happened yet, and I wish I had a crystal
      ball and could look clearly into the future and see what was coming. But I’m afraid… We’re pretty
      good pollsters at North Star Opinion Research, but we’re not quite that good.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, mentioning, since you mentioned things, in terms of the real world events, which is
      another set of things that haven’t happened yet, anything in particular from your experience or
      analysis of the opinion polls now, particular vulnerabilities on each side, if you could snap your
      fingers and make one thing happen or not happen either for Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the real
      world, in the economy, immigra— border, Ukraine, I don’t know, does one matter more than others? I
      mean, what is your sense?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      I mean, we’re still talking about changes at the margins when we’re talking about things like the
      economy getting better and Joe Biden being more trusted on the economy than Donald Trump, which he
      is not right now. But that’s so overwhelmed by the age problem and the Kamala Harris problem that
      it’s hard to see that kind of thing making a significant difference. It’s more likely to be some
      kind of health event affecting either one of these guys or some kind of unexpected, violent event
      that affects either one of them. I don’t know. And that’s why, while it looks so certain on the
      surface, it feels uncertain beneath the surface.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. That’s well said. You’ve mentioned Vice President Harris a few times. What about Trump’s VP
      pick? Does that make a difference or just try to avoid too much trouble?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah, just do no harm. That’s the first order of business, do no harm.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And you think he’ll follow that? He’s not going to pick Marjorie Taylor Greene or something?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      No, no. But he might pick Elise Stefanik.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, but he might view that as do no harm. I don’t know if she would do any harm incidentally. I
      mean, I guess like Kristi Noem or something would be safer. But I guess you don’t get a Nikki Haley
      pick. It’s not going to be a Reagan-Bush situation, you don’t think?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      No. I can’t imagine it. Not at this stage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Yeah, that’s the thing. I mean, we’ve been through races. I remember I was on TV a lot in
      2008, and there were Republicans who watched the Obama-Clinton race go on and on and on, and people
      forget it went on until the end, and it wasn’t entirely settled until the end. And it was pretty
      tough. I mean, it wasn’t such a… they ended up being, she served in his administration and so forth,
      but it didn’t feel that way. And there were people, “Oh, this is … ” And there were actual polling
      that show certain X percentage of Clinton voters wouldn’t vote for Obama. They were very offended by
      the way she’d been treated, blah, blah, blah. And I remember this case, rare case, I was actually
      right. I said, “They’re all going to end up voting for Obama.” This is like total “hopium” from
      among Republicans that this long, drawn-out race, whereas McCain had clinched by mid-March, I think,
      is going to really help much in the general and the underlying dynamics or the underlying dynamics.
      And then of course, we had the financial crisis that confirmed the underlying dynamics. But I feel
      like the Haley thing’s a little different. I mean, it’s not like Obama-Clinton, right? I mean, it’s—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      No. It reflects a resistance in the Democratic Party to Donald Trump coming back.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Republican Party.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Republican Party, excuse me, for Donald Trump coming back. But Bill, I need to revise and extend my
      remarks. We were talking about things that might affect the election. I neglected to mention that a
      Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce endorsement of Joe Biden would make it over. I mean, then it becomes a
      done deal. Taylor Swift and Kelce are part of this psyops thing, the deep state is coming to endorse
      Joe Biden, and that would probably have a dramatic effect on the outcome.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We have such a weird combination of such a serious moment in our history and such a public
      discourse, which is slightly crazy, honestly. I mean it’s …
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Let me get this straight here. The Republicans have had disappointing elections in 2018, 2020, 2021
      in Georgia and 2022. So the way to get majority support is to attack the most famous and most
      popular woman in the entire world, coupled with a superstar of America’s favorite sport. And this is
      supposedly going to help expand the Republican coalition? I mean, please. I wish there were an IQ
      bank where I could suggest these people go and take out a large loan, but I’m afraid that’s not
      possible. But it’s just kind of bizarre some of the stuff that comes on the internet. It just seems
      like the internet is this magnet for people who want to look foolish in the eyes of the world. And
      there are plenty of people who give into that tendency. It’s pretty amazing.

      But also, I do think, I mean, MAGA is much more extreme, honestly, and conspiratorial than previous
      very conservative elements of the party. Mostly. There were some extremely conspiratorial ones, but
      there were plenty of conservatives who didn’t like other aspects of popular culture. I talked about
      this the other day at a different… on a podcast. I mean, Murphy Brown with Dan Quayle, probably ill-
      advised honestly, but it was fine. We were making a point about family breakup and family structure.
      And he gave a serious speech in which he quoted for a sentence or two, made a point that Hollywood
      shouldn’t make light of the importance of having two parents at home and so forth. But there was no
      conspiracy theory, there was no personal attack on Candice Bergen or something like that. There
      wasn’t obsession about it. It was a line that got— and then it became a big deal for three or four
      days and didn’t end up mattering I think, honestly. And then where Tipper Gore criticized rap lyrics
      and it was a reasonable point she had that it was, maybe these weren’t the best. But that’s so
      different, that kind of cultural criticism you might call it, or middlebrow conservative hostility
      to Hollywood than kind of the conspiracy insanity that we now have. And I think it is an internet
      thing, but it is a MAGA thing in particular. You don’t see as much of this among 40% of Democrats
      thinking that, I don’t know what, that there are psyops going on on the other side or something. You
      might see it among some on the left, but it is pretty… Trump I would say, let’s close on this and
      let’s go back to Trump. Trump sort of resists this. I am sort of struck by that, that Trump does not
      want to be at war with major popular American institutions. Trump did not attack Disney. Trump did
      not attack the NFL. Trump liked, he called Tom Brady. Remember when he was actually president? He
      was watching football games. He was calling Tom Brady. He understands that he wants to be in sync
      with kind of much of, especially much of old-fashioned American, I don’t know what popular culture,
      Americana, that kind of thing.

      Mainstream America. I mean mainstream America loves Taylor Swift and loves NFL football.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It does make you wonder what happens afterwards. The MAGA sort of escapes kind of Trump’s, not
      for now in this election, I think. But there’s a part of MAGA that’s kind of out of Trump’s orbit by
      now and is really into a kind of Infowars world that Trump has catered to and brought into in a very
      responsible way in my opinion, done a lot of damage by legitimizing them. But that’s, he’s been
      pretty good at straddling, right? I mean at being… He’s got all those people with him. But then, if
      you want to convince yourself that, oh, come on, he is a little bit of a loudmouth, but basically,
      he’s going to govern a fairly normal Republican way and so forth, and he’s done a pretty good job of
      straddling that. That would be a bit of a challenge, I think, for him going forward. And then his
      personality of just wanting to attack Nikki Haley in pretty unattractive ways, and you got to think
      some people react against that, right? I don’t know. I don’t know.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      We’ll see. He did set up his own vice president to be murdered by a violent mob. So that is
      something that kind of sticks in people’s minds.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You would think. Not that it helped Mike Pence against Trump in the primaries, right? I mean, it’s
      kind of amazing that January 6th has almost disappeared. Let me close on that. I mean, this made my
      own recession January 6th. But I mean, why is no one talking about January 6th? The guy who was
      responsible for it, who incited it, who organized it to the degree it was a serious effort, and it
      was to some degree, who tried to sort of overturn the results of election is running for president.
      And no one… I don’t know. It’s like not an issue. I mean, Biden will make it an issue, I believe,
      but it’s sort of startling how little it’s in— Taylor Swift is much more in the American public
      discourse than January 6th, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, we’ve had three years of people downplaying the significance and importance of the first
      effort in American history to overturn an election. And it’s pretty stunning, but it is what it is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Would’ve been different, don’t you think if the Senate had convicted or if more people had gone in,
      let’s call it a Liz Cheney direction of taking it really fundamentally seriously, instead of
      accommodating it.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Oh sure. Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But they didn’t.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Well, they want to get reelected. They want to keep their seats.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In primaries especially.
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Yep.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, it sounds like we have to reconvene. I guess my takeaway from this, but I want you to give the
      final takeaway, the more serious one since you’ve been through this so many times and are so
      thoughtful about it is how quickly Trump can kind of wrap it up, how quickly he clinches it, and
      people just think it’s too hopeless to continue contributing to Haley and how quickly Haley decides
      to give up. But if that’s March 5th, which I think is the most likely maybe date, or maybe March
      12th, like she stays in another week, and the American public looks up and it’s Biden-Trump, I do
      think that’s a very interesting moment that people haven’t quite thought about enough about what
      does it really look like. I don’t know. I feel like it’s just, as you say it’s same old, same old on
      the surface, but underneath, I mean so much resistance to it. I’ll say one last thing, just because
      of it. The resistance to Biden, which is the term you used is very striking to me. I mean, I was
      talking with a couple of Democratic members actually the other day, moderate Dems in districts that
      are kind of swing-ish districts and their own polling A) confirms what you say. They won’t say this
      publicly, but Biden is running in their polling about three points, four points behind where he ran
      in 2020, which would only put him even, would be okay. It’s not quite as… It could be even in the
      popular vote, but you lose all the very close states if you get of three or four—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Not even in the electoral college, not even close.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. And these people are sort of running five, seven points ahead of Biden in their own
      districts, and they think they’ll hang on if Biden can keep it close, but not if it erodes a little
      more. But they just say informally that a lot of their own supporters—these are Democrats—they’re
      going to vote for them, for these Democratic candidates. They’re going to vote, they hate Trump, and
      they’re going to vote against Trump. Or they certainly don’t hate, or at least they don’t want Trump
      to be president again. But they say to these people, “So who’s the Democratic nominee going to be?”
      And these members of Congress say, “Well, President Biden.” “Well, isn’t something going to … ”
      They’ll work out a way to change that, right? I mean, they’ll work out a way to have some at the
      convention or something. He’ll step aside, it will be that governor of Michigan, whatever her name
      is, or someone else whom I’ve seen on TV a little bit. You know what I mean? The degree to which I
      think voters have not come to grips with the fact that it’s Biden-Trump is maybe a little greater
      than those of us inside the beltway who most of the people here have come to grips with it or think
      they’ve come to grips with it or have acceded to it. And I was struck by that—
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Resigned to it maybe.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What’s that?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Resigned to it, perhaps?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes, yes. But I don’t have the impression that the voters out there quite have gone, and they may
      not get so resigned, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Who knows? That’s the great conundrum right now.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s a good note to end on. Even though it’s people of course want wisdom from you and they want
      the crystal ball. What’s the point of all that polling if you can’t perfectly predict what’s going
      to happen over the next eight, nine months?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      Wish we could, Bill. But afraid that’s beyond our powers of public opinion research.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean, my takeaway from this is though that actually March, April, May become quite important
      because A) we have the question of is there a serious third party, which is very important, and how
      much voters just look up and kind of shudder at Trump v Biden, assuming that Trump does sort of
      dispose of Haley pretty quickly. So, A) there’s that question, third party, let’s call it question
      revulsion at Trump-Biden, question. But B) there’s the trials. I mean, I think we’ll know by May
      whether the trial is not what’s happened, and it will have happened in the trial, but whether the
      trial, any of these trials will even happen in 2024. So I feel like, usually you get these nominees
      picked in March or whatever, and then there’s a bit of a lull, and then everyone focuses again as
      the conventions happen. And nothing obvious at least happens in those March, April, May months. But
      I feel like a lot of, at least on both the trials front and the third party front, March, April, May
      become pretty important months, right?
  - speaker: Whit Ayres
    text: |
      I agree. I agree. Particularly on the trial front. We will tell a whole lot about what’s going to
      happen with those trials in March, April and May, I think.

      So we need to have a Memorial Day conversation and really see what we understand.
