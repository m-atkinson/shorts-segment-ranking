      Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again by James
      Carville, with whom I had a discussion, what, five weeks ago, which stands up quite well. Quite
      well. You were pretty bullish on Harris’s chances and on the convention. Then after the convention,
      I guess it slipped back to maybe an even race. Last night was the debate. We’re speaking here on,
      what is it, September 11th? Where do we stand? What do you think?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Well, Fox ran a story the night before the debate. I did Dan Abrams’ show and I said, “look, I’ll be
      honest with you, I think Trump’s walking into a trap.” I knew who was in the prep room and they were
      the right people and I thought that she would do very well. I thought he would be typically
      undisciplined and he was. I mean Laura Loomer. Yeah, I think it went very well. I was texting people
      last night and as you have been around Democratic culture a little bit more, there’s a great deal of
      negativity. It’s smart if you say something’s wrong and I had a friend of mine who’s actually very
      smart and this person texted me, I wish he’d talked more about the middle class and I said, did you
      see the first seven minutes of the debate? I mean, she was laying out child tax credits and
      everything that you could. I think this person was just being, felt like they had to be nitpicky.
      The stuff that I would get via text last night was very nitpicky too.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      She was getting under his skin, which she obviously did and which really is driving a lot of the
      coverage, at least as of now, the next day of the debate and it was very noticeable at the time. I
      mean, people now talk about it as if, well of course she got under his skin, but I don’t think
      that’s easy to do. It wasn’t so obvious that was going to work, at least to me. I thought she did it
      very skillfully, don’t you think?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I did and I thought the biggest challenge she had was people don’t know her. I think they found out
      a little bit more about her last night and there were 28%. I saw one poll, I hate to quote one poll,
      but I remember in the back of my mind it was a deep, pretty good one, said 28% were open for more
      information about her. 9% were open for more information about him. That last night couldn’t be
      anything but good, in that sense. You usually try to play these events down. Well, it’s pretty good.
      63 to 37 said she won the debate. Somebody told me, a reliable person, I’ve seen it myself. Plouffe
      said that they both did dial groups and they were about the same, showed what you’d expect them to
      show. And on the abortion question, there was a 40 point advantage, I think, which is unheard of. I
      can’t tell you, people said, well, the convention didn’t change much. It actually did change a
      little bit. If you look at favorability and other things are better. I think last night there’d be,
      can’t tell you it’s going to be dramatic changes, but I would be a little disappointed if she didn’t
      have some… People have more familiar with her and a little bit more of a positive opinion. And the
      biggest thing she did was talking about turning the page. Hopefully he looks stale and yesterday and
      I think he kind of did.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This is what you stressed four or five weeks ago and I really think she very much stressed that she
      had that line that I think was prepared. At one point when I guess he was going on about the
      Biden/Harris administration, blaming her for things and she said, I’m not Joe Biden. I’m certainly
      not Donald Trump and she took the edge off the first half of that sentence in a sense, by making it
      an anti-Trump thing ultimately, but I think she really wanted to say that. Don’t you think? She
      wanted to say those words, I’m not Joe Biden.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      She went in. I was very clear that she needs to kind of separate her herself from Biden. That’s not
      being disrespectful of anybody. People understand that. What she has here, Bill, is when you think
      about it, she has a lot of strategic space. She has Dick Cheney and Pramila Jayapal in her
      coalition, okay, that’s not going to last very long, but for right now, hey, whatever you got to
      say, I’m fine with it. Now the question is, does she pivot? I hate that word, but people use it all
      the time. What I think she has license to do is, I think the party’s, whatever we consider it’s
      base, will allow her great leeway in appealing to more unaligned voters and Trump doesn’t have that.
      In abortion, he’s caught. He doesn’t have very much strategic space at all because if he goes one
      way, the pro-life people will get furious. He goes another way and the people that he needs to
      supplement his base, get furious. He’s caught in a pretty bad place there and I can’t think of an
      issue where she doesn’t have space to operate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, well I was struck by that, so let’s just talk about it. Let me get back to one question about
      the vote. I think some people, the race is over last night and all. Other people, the other extreme.
      It’s not clear it’ll change any vote share, any ballot test, even though she won the debate. I did
      see one, that someone told me about a private super PAC that was doing its own focus groups and dial
      testing, that actually asked the ballot tests, didn’t just ask who won the debate. These were
      undecided voters and soft supporters of both Harris and Trump and there was pretty good movement. I
      mean it wasn’t 80/20, it was more like 45/25, with about 35 still saying, I want to know more, but
      that’s pretty surprising, I think, for a debate. It usually doesn’t move the ballot test much at
      all. Do you think we will see actual movement in the polls?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I hope so, but I’m not very good at predicting these things and probably neither is anybody else.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, of course that’s for sure.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Let’s say this upfront. Let’s just take the economy because I’m working on a piece. The question is
      not, is it a good economy or a bad economy? I mean, you can ask that and it’s fine, but have we got
      to the point where people feel like they have something to lose? Maybe it’s not what I want it to
      be. I was on the Wall Street Journal today, was for the first time incomes are up since the end of
      the pandemic. 4% is pretty good and they adjust for inflation and everything else when they do that,
      it’s just not a number they pull out. We know the stock market is good. Some said, well, I don’t
      like it overall, but if Trump gets in there and they did a good job, highest tariffs would be bad
      and economists say this would be bad. I’m sitting there saying, well, I got a little bit more than I
      thought I did. I tip a little bit higher. I buy an extra magazine at the airport. In your own kind
      of behavior, other people feel the same way. I think she doesn’t need to tell people the economy is
      great, but I think she now has license to say, you have something to lose and I think that’s an
      important threshold across.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. Any issues that leapt out to you last night and then we’ll go forward,
      that either slight vulnerabilities for her, just to get on the nay saying side again or real
      strengths that she can just continue to exploit? Anything that got you slightly worried or other
      things that you thought, man, she can really go to town on this?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      They’re going to continue on the 2020 foolishness and she’s answered it, but she could have to do it
      a little bit better and I think she can, but she looked like she knew what she was talking about.
      She didn’t look vapid at all. You know when you introduce somebody as a former prosecutor, Attorney
      General, United States Senator, Vice President, she honestly, [inaudible] is not particularly
      engaged. She’s like, well, I don’t know if she’s qualified. I said, I could tell you what. In terms
      of qualifications, she’s the most qualified person to run non-incumbents since maybe old man Bush.
      You could say what you want about him, but he was qualified by any stretch of imagination. Think she
      is too.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But less well-known. I mean, she had the virtue, we discussed this a month ago, of not having a
      primary of course and getting the nomination in this somewhat bizarre and unusual way. She had the
      deficiency of not having to go through a year of debates and speeches and tough interviews. That was
      why I was nervous the last few days. Presidential debate, as you know, is its own thing and she’s
      never done one of those and she’s done one VP debate four years ago and not a whole ton of real big
      interviews over the last four years. It was impressive that she was as poised and in command as she
      was, I thought.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I was told, that Philippe Reines, who played Trump, who’s very good at it. These guys almost, it’s
      like golf to them. They practice all the time and he was sort of in debate prep, I was told, I can’t
      verify this, that he actually kind of dressed like Trump. He had a blue suit and a red tie, took too
      long, but he has all of the mannerisms down and I didn’t have the sense that she was surprised by
      anything. I had the sense that she was prepared and you could see the answer. I’m not Joe Biden, but
      I’m not you either. She was waiting for that, you know that. They said, okay, slow down, say this
      and there was a guy in debate prep, I’m told, by the name of Michael Sheehan, who was like an MVP
      that no one ever heard of. From 1986 on, I would never do a debate without Michael. This is where
      you’re looking when you say the line, you say it five times. The camera angle, what she wore. I
      liked the outfit she had on when she went on the stage. I think it startled Trump because she’s what
      I’d call a handsome looking woman. She’s tall and she looks authoritative and kind of sexist to say
      it, but who gives a shit, I thought she was dressed very well for it and I think her appearance
      probably rattled him a little bit out of her shoot.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Do you think her walking over to shake his hand, which I don’t think he expected.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I thought that was great. She wanted him to get a good look at her. Remember, the last democratic
      candidate who got look at it was President Biden, which not exactly going to scare you off the
      stage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no. I think her going over there and being totally unintimidated. That was pretty interesting.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      All intentional and very, very good.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Will there be another debate?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      There’ll be a debate over the debates because now Trump was saying he won, 91% says he won. He
      doesn’t think they need another. She said that she’s willing. Prior to last night, given the latest
      beta poll, Democrats were getting alarmed. They were feeling a bit better. She’s more in control of
      things now than he is. This is what’s changed. [Inaudible] He’ll come up and then we’ll have a long
      debate about debates and whether or not she should do long-form interviews or sit down or sit down.
      This is inevitable. But if the subtle change in position is very favorable to her as she deals with
      these things going forward.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think it’s such an important point. It doesn’t always show up, as you say, in the actual ballot
      tests, in the polls and so forth. But somehow I do feel like there was an inflection point and she
      now can sort of shape things in a way that wasn’t clear that she could a couple of days ago.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I would never let a pollster, do what they call a doubts battery. Bill Kristol is a right-wing
      authoritarian they said in some op-ed piece and such and such. The question is not: Do you agree or
      disagree with Bill Kristol’s statement? The question was: Are you more or less likely to vote for
      Bill Kristol having heard this? All right? And I used to hate to get to questions. I don’t care if
      people agree or disagree with it, all right, but what I want to know is: Does this drive voting
      behavior? Because that’s the only thing you really care about. You made a very astute point that at
      least one person we know, we don’t know for sure, that it did change votes. And the question is not
      who you think won the debate, it’s are you more or less likely, you might ask you a little bit
      broader, having seen this debate, are you more or less likely to vote for Harris or Trump? Which is
      much better framing of the question.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So what does she do now, do you think? There’s people that, “She’s got to get out there and do a
      million interviews.” Other people, “No, no, no. You really need to take a week to capitalize on this
      and ride this white wave as long as you can.” And how does this work? In ’92, we were joking about
      this before the camera started rolling, you were there with Bill Clinton, had a very good debate
      against George H.W. Bush in, I guess, mid-October ’92. And I mean, how do you capitalize on a good
      debate?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Well, I think you’re going to see it. They asked him about immigration. This is my favorite. They
      asked about immigration. I love this. We need to talk about the issues. If Trump just went out and,
      okay, so they asked immigration, that was the strongest issue. And he started talking about crowd
      size.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      If I was his campaign manager, I would’ve stuck a fork in my eye. And I love this Lindsey Graham,
      “If you just go out and talk about the issues, it’s all going to be fine.” Of course he can’t do
      that. And he gets the immigration question. By the way, she’s pretty good. I think she did pretty
      well on that question. But he didn’t even take advantage of that ‘cause he’s so massively, he’s a
      massively insecure person. That’s the thing to remember about Trump. And we always miss that point.
      Because his people think he’s so ordained by God and King Cyrus and everything. But he is just
      insecure about his hand size. He’s insecure about his hair. He’s insecure about the fact that he’s
      never been part of the Manhattan elite. He’s insecure about a lot. And you could just see that
      coming out. He’s just a massively insecure guy, and it was on display.
  - speaker: Bill Kristoll
    text: |
      Yeah, I thought that was a key. So they began with the economy, where I think she did fine. But he
      did his thing. Then they went to abortion where she did very well, and he’s weak on that. But then
      they came to immigration. I think despite all the talk about the ABC people were so tough on Trump,
      that was a pretty good sequence for Trump. He got the economy first, then he got immigration third
      and she gave a good answer. I agree. She emphasized the bipartisan bill that Trump torpedoed and so
      forth. And she stuck in there, and it really was kind of stuck in, this didn’t have anything to do
      with it, the crowd size point. Right? She’s the one who said, “And incidentally, his speeches are
      boring and the crowds are leaving before they’re over.” And it didn’t have much to do with the
      immigration answer. But that was very well done. He couldn’t resist. Right? As you say, he missed 90
      of the 120 seconds of what is his best issue because he couldn’t resist saying, “No, that’s totally
      wrong about the crowds.”
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Right. It just [inaudible]. But I love the issues. “Oh, if we just forgot everything and we just
      voted on the issues.” But the most popular thing that you can propose in American politics was, is
      and will be raising taxes on the people who make over a half-million dollars a year. I don’t know
      how to tell you that, but that’s the issue that will get you 73% every time. But yeah, I thought
      that was hilarious when he had a chance to run with the issue, he went to crowd size.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      A lot of people have been saying she should do, follow up with a lot of interviews. I’m not really
      sure that’s right. I mean, what do you think as a tactical matter here?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I don’t know. I don’t think the public really cares if she sits down with a half hour with Kaitlan
      Collins.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Or with anybody else. They always have to say something. All right? Whatever you do, it’s never
      going to be satisfactory. And I got some texts this morning from some reporters, ” Do you think she
      needs to sit down?” I said, “I’m not sure she does at all.” And the big question people are going to
      have is: Are we going to have another debate or not? That’s what people give a shit about.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I don’t know what the audience was last night, but it was a lot. It was tens of millions easily. And
      who wants to sit there and watch Meet The Press for 40 minutes where you’re just grilled? I mean not
      very many people. Meet The Press has been very good to my family, but that’s just not where people
      are.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean, I was thinking about this. Yeah. And also, I just think you can make one slight slip up and
      suddenly that becomes the story. And I think you can ride this debate for, maybe I’m wrong though,
      for quite a while. I mean it was a very big deal. Tens of millions of people watched it. It’s now
      going to have second and third day follow-up in terms of clips being shown. Do you agree with that?
      I mean, she has some time here to ride this. Right?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I totally agree with it. And one of the things that really conspired against him was the last debate
      was maybe the most significant Presidential debate in Presidential debate history. I mean, it ended
      up with a candidate having to drop out of the race. So I think just heightened. And I also really
      believe that the Trump people, and even some of the non-Trump people, thought he was a great
      debater. He’s never been. I mean, his play against Biden, which is like beating the Chicago White
      Sox or something, I mean everybody does that. And a big question I think is, will there be another?
      And she says, “Okay, I’m fine with that.” And he said, “Well, I don’t know if I need one.” And of
      course they’ll figure something out. When you are asked the inevitable question: When are you going
      to do a long-form interview? Says, “I’m ready to do another debate. I want to do it where the most
      people see it and I have best chance to make my case.” And you’re never going to satisfy them. So it
      doesn’t matter. Just forget about it and just keep talking about the next debate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s good. I like that. No, I’m slightly against the interview focus. I just think it can trip
      you up in a way that’s not helpful. And she’s already made her key points. She could— I mean, the
      other way to go might be, or a way to go, would be to give some set speeches on major issues. That
      is a tradition that presidential candidates do. Bill Clinton did it in the fall of ’91. She never
      had a chance to do it, in a sense. But you could. They might not be fascinating, and millions of
      people aren’t going to watch them; but from a media point of view, you give your serious speech at
      Georgetown on foreign policy and your serious speech at some economic club on economic policy.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      The Economic Club is the kind of gold standard. I don’t know why. They’re destroying economics. But
      it’s easy to get to. It sounds very Middle America and industrial and that. But what’s wrong with
      that? Yeah, Georgetown, Clinton, we did our foreign policy speech in Georgetown. It’s close by.
      Everybody knows it’s got a good brand, take advantage of it. She could do a China speech. And talk
      about how it’s an adversary but not an enemy. There’s a standard foreign policy, Foreign Affairs
      Magazine. But you can do that, and it’s got to be covered. And it will. And she can make news like
      that. She can do new economic stuff. She can talk about how tariffs have a very checkered history of
      doing any good. I mean, there’s a thousand things that she can do. And she can actually take five or
      six questions, of which you can plant two. Okay? I mean, that’s one of the things. You should never
      do a town hall, a speech, you can’t plant all the questions because it’ll be evident that they were
      planted. But you can say, “Mr. Kristol, you in the back. Oh gee, I’m glad you asked that question.
      Hadn’t thought about until right now, but blah blah.” And “Well, God, she’s pretty good on her feet.
      Bill Kristol asked that question and she hadn’t thought about it.” And of course they’ve thought
      about it for five hours.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I’m shocked to even hear this discussion of being anything less than perfectly straightforward in a
      campaign. But I do think the other speeches might answer, sort the media complaints about policy and
      also let her develop some policy stuff, which could be, it’s a way of going to the center in a very
      careful way, it seems to me, where you could write it up ahead of time so you don’t inadvertently
      get into some controversy where Bernie Sanders is attacking you for the next three or four days. I’m
      not sure that would hurt, but still.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I wouldn’t be surprised if she doesn’t do some of that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. For me, of course, as a McCain person, I love the moment when she went out of her way, again,
      this was clearly planned, in discussing Obamacare and healthcare, which is not a McCain special
      issue, unlike foreign policy. She went out of her way to remind everyone of the moment when McCain
      showed up on the floor of the Senate when he was already ill and with a thumbs down. And she was a
      senator then, so it was appropriate for her to reminisce about that. But it was a way of her to say
      “The late, great John McCain.” And then Trump had to remind everyone why he didn’t like McCain. But
      there were quite a lot of people who voted for McCain, and so there’s some number of them probably
      hadn’t, were interested that she respects McCain and spoke well of him.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Jimmy, his son, who every time I would see Senator McCain, I think Jimmy was in the Marines. I think
      he was enlisted Marine for a while.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes, I think he was. Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      And he’d always bring up Jimmy to me. Well, Dick Cheney, he didn’t say, “I’m torn.” He said, “I’m
      voting for Harris.” And I keep hearing from a lot of people, and the same thing is true of The
      Bulwark people and other people, like “We’re for Harris. That’s it. We’re not reluctantly and we’ve
      been sucked into this. That’s just where we are.” And you keep hearing about these people, I won’t
      say their names, but their initials are Rex Tillerson and Jim Mattis, how much they hate Trump and
      what a giant fool he is, but they won’t say anything. Well, if Dick Cheney came out, you can come
      out and just say, “I’m simply voting for Harris.” It’s not that hard. You might lose a couple of gin
      rummy partners at the Dallas Country Club, but such is life. We all have to make sacrifices, don’t
      we?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s striking how many of them don’t want to quite cross that bridge. They’ll say things, even
      sometimes in public, about Trump’s lack of judgment and all this other stuff, and then they won’t
      quite pull the trigger, so to speak. Right?
  - speaker: James Carville

      Do what Dick Cheney did.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Okay? Just “I’m voting for Harris.” I mean, maybe you don’t want to go as far as Liz went and
      endorse Colin Allred. Okay, I can buy that. But if it’s necessary, but just say. And I do think that
      Cheney saying that is going to make some difference. I mean, you kind of know where it’ll make a
      difference is just certain people, most of them in pretty affluent, traditionally Republican areas.
      They say, “Well, Cheney’s doing it. I guess I can do it too.” They needed some permission to do what
      they were kind of inclined to do in the first place. I think it was important, and I wish more of
      these types would come out and just say it. You don’t have to say anything more than, “I’m going to
      cast my vote for Harris in the coming presidential election.” That’s it. You don’t need any more
      than that. [Inaudible] why.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. As someone who’s been involved in the attempt to get Republicans to come out for Harris
      against Trump and then for Harris, I’d say there’s a lot of skepticism, like would it really matter.
      You think it would, especially if there were more. Don’t you think there’s some critical mass, and
      if George W. Bush did, for example? Why is he being so quiet, incidentally? What’s that about?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      A lot of them are just torn by this. I don’t know. Ask him. I think Cheney was bigger than W. I
      think it gave people more of a license. I don’t know how to quantify that. Do I think it’s going to
      be a huge number of votes, no, but it could make a difference in a lot of places that make a
      difference, in Buckhead and places like that. A lot of places in Maricopa County, Scottsdale, where
      you’re probably going to lose in a normal election 68-32, you might lose 65-35. If you chip away at
      enough of that, you could do pretty good.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. There are a lot of people there. There’s the George W. Bush, Paul Ryans of the world, the
      people who served in Trump’s own cabinet and own White House, the John Kellys of the world. As you
      say, Tillerson. I mean, there’s a fairly substantial pool of people who could say, “Look, I’m not
      going to attack the guy for 10 minutes. I’m not going to discuss private conversations we had in the
      Oval Office. I’m just going to give you my judgment. He shouldn’t be president again, and I’m going
      to vote for Harris.” Don’t you think that would be enough?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      In those WOW counties in Wisconsin, like suburban Republican, traditional Republican counties around
      Milwaukee, I bet you that Trump does less well there than you would think, and I think that’s where
      this matters.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, that would really be something. But you think it still would help to get some comfort in the
      numbers?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yes, I do. I think people just need an extra shove, because it’s hard. I mean, I’ve voted Democratic
      all of my life. It’s in the DNA, and it’s hard to abandon your DNA. Yes, I do. By the way, for every
      voter in Milwaukee, lethargic, low-potential voter, you get them out and you get one vote. For every
      WOW county Republican you turn around, you get a net two. I’d rather have a net two than one. I’d
      take both, but you don’t have to make a choice between the two at all.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The gender gap, do you agree that it could be bigger than ever in this election? Or is it that
      people say that all the time, it doesn’t quite work? What’s your thought on that?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I’ve always been worried about males. Yes, females are more important than males by a factor of
      probably 52-48, but 48 is a big number. I hope the gender cap closes, but it closes in a way that we
      don’t lose females but we pick up more, and we may. I have thought, you know how we have every cycle
      there’s a fashionable demographic, the NASCAR dads, soccer moms, national security, the year of the
      Black female, okay? I actually think that the demographic that may have the most elasticity in this
      cycle might be white college males. A, they tend to be much more pro-choice than non-college white
      males, and B, they’re probably doing, because of the markets and other stuff… I don’t have a figure
      in front of me, but I’m pretty safe in saying that more college white males are in the stock market
      than other demographics, and that we are the least fashionable demographic in America. You could
      listen to NPR for two weeks and not even know that we exist. I do think there’s some elasticity in
      upward movement for her among college white males.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. Well, that would be worth really looking at.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Right. It’s instinct. I can’t go to a well of polling data or anything, but it seems like there’s
      real chances there, and I think the abortion stuff is really going to open up some opportunities
      there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Also, I suppose just Trump looking crazy and chaotic to these people, right?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yeah. If you are a mid-level banker, you’re not impressed with what you saw.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. On the 2019, 2020 issues that you mentioned where she took these left-wing positions, which
      she’s walked away from but hasn’t really explained much why she changed her mind, any ones that
      strike you as particular vulnerabilities, that you think the Trump people are just going to hammer
      for the next week or two or three as they try to recover from the debate?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Oh, she has vulnerabilities. I mean, every kind of silly thing they thought. I’d love to know who
      the political consultant was that told her to do that, because he or she should be summarily
      horsewhipped. It was a really strange time in the Democratic Party, where I don’t know if people
      collectively thought this was the wave of the future. Of course, it was no such thing, and she’s
      just going to have to say that she grew in experience. I mean, there’s good answers to it. I can’t
      tell you there’s great answers to it, but she needs to deal with it. I wish it’d have come up more
      last night. I think you ought to get it out of the way. That may be where you do a long-form
      interview. You gotta always want the question. If I were coaching somebody, once you have a sense
      that, “I hope they don’t ask about this,” then you’ve lost. You gotta affirm and say, “I want him to
      ask me about that, because I’m ready for it.” In anything in life, if you want to avoid talking
      about something, when it comes up, you’re not going to do it very well. You gotta put in your mind,
      “I want that question,” and I think she can do that. The other thing last night gave her,
      understand, she hadn’t been on a national stage that long. Her presidential race was disastrous. She
      had a not particularly stellar first two and a half, three years as vice president. She’s gotta be
      feeling today like, “Goddamn, I can do this.” She should. I mean, just reason says she should. I
      mean, confidence is a big, big thing in a candidate, a big thing.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, talk more about that. I’m so interested by it. You’ve been through these campaigns, and what
      do we have, a little less than eight weeks left here as we speak on September 11th. How will it go
      now? How fast is the pace? How crazy is it? Does she have time to step back and say, “Well, I really
      need to address, get out of the way almost, some of these objections about what I said in the past.
      Maybe I’ll give a set speech on that next week.” Or is it just frantic, four events a day, or both?
      What will it be like and how fast and furious will everything be, and how much can she make it a
      certain way?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      We’ve got some markers coming up. It’s September 11th today, but the big marker coming up is October
      7th.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Okay? That’s going to be a bucketload of coverage, a lot of uncomfortableness everywhere, but
      particularly in some quarters of the Democratic Party. If I’m her, I’ve got this thing bookmarked,
      and maybe that’s a time to give a speech on, you know, foundations of Middle East policy or
      something like that. I don’t know, but you’re not going to escape October 7th. I think October 7th
      is a more relevant date than September the 11th. Not that I think it’s a more relevant event,
      anything like that, but one is 23 years ago and one is not even a year ago. You gotta be aware of
      that. That’s a big date. That’s clearly a place where she could talk— give a speech and take some
      questions and that kind of stuff.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. I guess in general, I’m struck that… tell me if I’m correctly interpreting
      this… that you’re saying that obviously she’ll capitalize on her strengths, the issues she’s got a
      big advantage on over Trump and the characteristics, personal characteristics she has an advantage
      on, but she also needs to play some defense at the same time that you’re playing offense, and prop
      up your walls, your protection on some of these things where they are going to come after her,
      whether it’s I guess immigration or crime or some of the stuff from 2019, 2020. It would be mistake
      to think that she had a good debate and therefore she can just forget about it, all these other
      things are done, finished.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      No, no. October 7th is going to come, and it’s going to get a lot of attention.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, and these other issues they will make that will give them some attention. The VP debate,
      October 1st, I guess that’s scheduled. I guess that will happen. Will it matter?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Well, you see he threw Vance under the bus last night.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Is that right?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yeah. Harris set it up. “Well, your vice president, J.D. Vance, said this.” “Well, I haven’t talked
      to him about that.” I think it was on an abortion question.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Oh, right, right. Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      The guy has just been a massive disappointment, and he hears stuff particularly from these right-
      wing Catholics and he goes out and repeats it like it’s really smart. I know that you know the
      childless cat lady thing came right out of Tucker’s mouth, in his ear and out of his mouth. That’s
      so Tuckeresque, you don’t even have to think twice of where that came from. For the record, he used
      to work for Bill. I used to do a TV show with Tucker. We know him quite well. You know that’s where
      it came from. Boy, I’ll tell you. She made reference, but what you look for in politics is something
      sticky. Sometimes it’s unjustified, the potato incident or something like that, or, “I didn’t have
      sex with that woman.” I mean, I could think of many, many things on our side also. The childless cat
      lady thing, it’s now standard. You don’t even need to explain it to people. Then they started
      talking about the immigrants eating cats. Like, okay, you’re just bringing more attention to it. And
      they can’t get away from it. And go, have the debate. People will watch it because Vance is a kind
      of object of curiosity. He’s shown himself to be… something’s weird about that guy, and it’s going
      to be interesting. It’ll have some play. It’ll have some play.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Maybe more than a typical VP debate, like our under-card debate, like ours was. Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yeah. All we had, the famous 1988. And John Kennedy was a friend of mine.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Thank you for reminding. It’s good that you can bring up all… the potato, the John Kennedy is a
      friend of mine.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Right, yeah. But you don’t even have to explain these things anymore.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      True.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      They just have become part of… Biden, “We’re going to get rid of Medicare.” Whatever he said. But
      it’s just funny how Biden doesn’t exist anymore, and you can see she was waiting for that. I’m not
      Joe Biden. That was in her quiver. She was ready for that. She wanted to say that. And then of
      course, “I’m not you either.” That was a good breakaway moment for her.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. On the negative side for Harris, I’ve worried a lot about the incumbency. You just can’t walk
      away from it. You’re the vice president. It’s the wrong track. The country thinks the two favorites
      were on the wrong track. Biden doesn’t have a high favorable rating, so how do you… and I got to
      say, the attack on her is far left, I think. I’m not sure how successful it was, but that Trump did
      try to do last night. The actual tying Biden administration things around Harris’s neck, didn’t do
      that much of, and generally she’s paid less of a price for that than I would’ve thought in this
      campaign. Do you think she still could? Or is it just she’s so different from Biden that it doesn’t
      quite stick?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      There’s a simple factor of American politics that we have to acknowledge. The Democrats have not
      lost an election since Dobbs, and I include 2022 in that. I don’t think this administration is any
      less popular today than it was in October or November of 2022.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s for sure. Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      And I’ve always alluded. What cracks me up are all these people that say, “This is what the
      Democratic party…” all these Republicans. There’s always been Republicans giving advice to
      Democrats. “But this is what you really need to do to get your house in order.” I’m like, “Well, if
      the measure’s winning elections, we really don’t need to get our house in order. We’re doing fine.
      If it’s something else, maybe we do.” So, I think there’s evidence. We’ve had a bucket load of
      special elections or referenda. There’s been a lot of political activity since the summer of 2022,
      and it’s been almost universally faithful to Democrats, which is in an environment where the
      Democratic presidential administration is certainly, you’d say, not particularly popular.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And you think that’s mostly Dobbs?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      It’s the first place. Yeah, I suspect it is. It was the biggest, mega event that would account for
      winning elections when you’re not particularly popular at the top. Yeah, I think it is Dobbs.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I thought Harris did a good job last night of saying, A, “You appointed these three justices who
      made overturning Roe possible,” and B, she referred over and over to the Trump abortion bans in
      these different states. Because Trump has in his mind that he can get out of it by saying it’s a
      state’s issue, not a national issue now, but maybe not quite so easy. And then there’s a question,
      would you veto a national abortion ban? And all that stuff.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      But Democrats, people would not trust us on taxes. We’d come out and say, “Oh no, we’re for middle
      class tax cuts.” They don’t trust the Republicans on abortion. They don’t give a shit what they say.
      I know who these people are. They’re just saying that to say that. And the harder they try… this is
      another thing I noticed about Trump last night. Most great politicians, and people like Reagan,
      Clinton, and even Obama come to mind. You never saw them sweat. They never looked desperate. Of
      course they were trying very hard. Competitive as you can be. He looked like he was really trying
      last night. He went into an abortion thing. He was talking fast. You could see he was nervous. He
      was trying to talk around it, and I think voters got a little bit of a sense of that. He didn’t like
      it. Of course he doesn’t believe the shit about abortion, and everybody wanted it, all the legal
      scholars, everybody wanted it returned to states, of course. But it doesn’t do any good to argue
      with him on that, and I think she did a good job of humanizing the issue.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. No, I thought that was impressive. I’ll let you go in a few minutes, but any last words for
      Vice President Harris herself? For Governor Walz? The campaign strategists? Still a long way to go,
      but…
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yeah. I’d say that, a long way to go. People still, for better or worse, know Trump. They both know
      who you are and Trump are. They’re pretty convinced that they know what Trump is. There’s still… I
      know you had a great debate, you had a great convention, but you still have some more to fill out
      here. There’s no doubt about that. And you got some… always look at the calendar and make the
      calendar your friend. And I do think that they need to look at the fact that, my sense is there’s a
      little economic momentum out there. It’s based on some improved consumer confidence numbers and
      stuff like that. You certainly shouldn’t go out and tell the people that your economy’s great or
      good, but you can imply that you have something at risk now. You start laying tariffs on everything
      and start doing a lot of herky-jerky stuff, you could make things worse. And I think there’s real
      opportunity there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. That’s interesting because Biden was criticized, including by you and others, you can’t tell
      people, “The economy’s fine. Don’t believe what you’re seeing.” But you think there is now a chance
      not to say that but to build on what is probably slightly better sense of things. Also, I guess the
      Fed’s going to cut rates in a week, right? A week from today.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      That’s a big event. September 18th. Okay?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Put that on your schedule. We talked about October 7th. September 18th is going to be a big event
      because, I know they’re going to cut rates. We think it’s a quarter point. It may be a half point.
      But they’re going to pick up the paper or the site or wherever they get their new, and they’re going
      to say, “Interest rates may come down.” I’m not sure we’re not going to be able to… I can see myself
      maybe getting that house a little bit down the road. But we can’t remember interest rate cuts. What
      our whole recent memory is is to just keep… I don’t quite understand how to do that but I’ve seen
      people complain a lot about the Fed. I don’t know how you could do it much better than they’ve done
      it, honestly. We’ve gotten rid of inflation. We haven’t had massive unemployment. It could all go to
      hell in a hand basket tomorrow. I’m not suggesting anything other than that, but there’s a guy who
      jumped out of the 40 story building and said as he passed the 20th story, “So far so good.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s always worth reminding—
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      …until November. After the first week in November.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Always worth reminding people of that famous line. And maybe next week is the 19th time when you
      give your economic speech. Build on whatever positive momentum there is after the Fed rate cut.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      The 19th.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I’m all for the Detroit economic [inaudible].
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think it’s good that we’re scheduling the Harris campaign here for them. I’m sure they appreciate
      this work that we’re doing.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I’m sure they all listen in, glued to the podcast
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I hope so. I’ll let you go, but I love that. I love the, “As you pass the 20th floor,
      everything’s fine.” It reminds me, it’s so much in the same spirit as my favorite John McCain line
      that he used to love using in speeches, that, “It’s always darkest before it turns pitch black.”
      It’s a saying.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      I like that. Yeah. Yeah, because you expect that the darkest hour is before dawn. It gets dark and
      then it gets really dark.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That was very McCain-like. Anyway, James, any last words or we’re good?
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      No, we’re good. Hope we get together after the election hopefully.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Or maybe even if there’s another debate. We should do another one.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      Yeah, absolutely. I love doing it, and I love the work The Bulwark does. I think it’s really
      important work. And I think we have some opportunities here.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Great.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      And once this crisis passes, maybe we can all get back to the way we were. But we don’t have that
      luxury right now.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No. We sure don’t for the next two months.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      No.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      James, thanks very much.
  - speaker: James Carville
    text: |
      You bet.
