      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined today by Joe
      Klein, veteran columnist, commentator, author. Began as a reporter. And we can talk about that if
      you want, Joe, but I think that’s informed so much of your commentary, and you’ve stayed a reporter
      throughout, and traveled to Afghanistan, Iraq, and around America, and based your commenting on
      reporting, which has not been the case for all of us as much. So I give you a lot of credit for
      that, and I think it’s made your commentary so much more interesting. You were columnist for Time ,
      Newsweek , many other major organs, author of the bestselling book, Primary Colors , and… was that
      1996? I don’t think I’ve ever told you this, but a very distinguished political scientist I know, it
      was a private conversation, so I won’t say his name, but told me in ’96, ‘7, I can’t remember, we
      were just chatting, and he raised the book and asked if I’d read it, and I said yes. He said, “I
      think that book, I’m thinking of assigning it in class. I think that book teaches its readers more
      about contemporary American politics than 98% of all the political science stuff I assign.” And he
      was a tough grader. Not an easygoing guy who loved popular literature, so you should take that—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      That may be more a commentary on political science than on Primary Colors .
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, yes. That could be true. But anyway, people should still read that book. And now—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Thank you.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …you have an excellent Substack, “Sanity Clause,” which people should sign up for, and which I read
      diligently. So, thank you, Joe, first of all, for joining me today. Where does that phrase, “Sanity
      Clause,” come from?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      It comes from the Marx Brothers, A Night at the Opera . The opera manager is saying, “You guys are
      crazy! I can’t have you. You’re fired.” And Chico produces a massive contract. It just goes on and
      on and on, and he reads through and reads through. And he finally says, “There ain’t no sanity
      clause.” And I called it that because I don’t think there’s much of a sanity clause in most
      commentary these days. Well, this is, you talk about all these places I’ve worked for. I keep on
      retiring and then unretiring, and I think that this is the third time I’ve unretired. But you’re
      right. I began as a reporter, I saw myself as a reporter even when I was writing columns, and I
      learned a lot from that. The first big story I ever covered was busing in Boston, and I came into it
      as a classic ’60s liberal, and then I went out in the streets and into the neighborhoods, and I
      couldn’t find any Black parents who were in favor of it. And since then, that has made me a very
      uncomfortable partisan, someone who takes conservative positions on some issues, what would be
      liberal positions on other issues, but all of it usually based on reporting.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s great. And you wrote a terrific piece, I remember, which I think captures a lot of your
      thought. And it was the mid-’90s, which was a cover story, as I recall, in Newsweek , “The Radical
      Middle.” So, we can talk about that, and will we ever get to a radical successful center or middle
      in American politics? Or will sanity come back? But why don’t we begin with the Democrats? You’ve
      been sort of closer to them, I would say, over the decades, and have known many of them so well, and
      been a sympathetic critic of so many of their policies and the politicians. So go back to the ’70s
      where you just began. And so I mean, as a way of understanding today’s Democratic Party, and then
      we’ll get to Trump and everything else, but I don’t know. Yeah. So busing, that was kind of a wake-
      up call that all was not well on the left of the Democratic Party?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that was it. But there were other things that had positioned me on the left
      before that, which were the war in Vietnam, obviously, and the civil rights movement. I was never
      much of a socialist, and what busing taught me was that when government tries to do social
      engineering, it usually doesn’t work. And concomitant with that is that when government tries to do
      industrial policy, when it tries to pick winners and losers in the free market, that often doesn’t
      work, with the exception of industries, and I think that Biden is moving in this direction now, that
      involved national security. Chips should be made here. I kind of think that even though US Steel is
      a very peripheral business in the steel industry these days, it might be nice if that stayed US-
      owned. But I do believe that the Democrats took a very wrong turn in the ’70s, and they’ve been
      paying for it ever since. Because of the civil rights movement, and because of various other
      movements like feminism, gay rights, immigration, and so on, Democrats became the party of identity
      rather than unity. And—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And these were movements that you were sympathetic to, I think?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, yes, but in their—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In their core, original agendas, right?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      In their core, original agendas, certainly. But the one thing, and it’s really amazing to me, that
      you will never hear a Democratic candidate acknowledge is they won. The last 60 years have been the
      most incredible in the history of the human species when it comes to the advancement of human
      rights. I mean, you don’t hear Democrats talking about the tremendous improvements in the condition
      of Black people in this country. You know, the gay rights movement succeeded in eliminating
      thousands of years of unnecessary human suffering in the blink of an eye. Women, I saw a piece the
      other day that too many women are graduating from college and too few men. I think we have a male
      problem, especially a young male problem, in the country, but Democrats won’t acknowledge this.
      Latinos are assimilating in the same way that Italians did 100 ago, through small business, through
      construction, but they’re assimilating. They want to be part of this thing. And I think that this
      thing, this American thing, is far more important than any of the identity agendas that are out
      there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You were close to Bill Clinton, and I mean, wrote a lot about him, and of course, the book is based
      on his primary campaign. How did he succeed, and how did he not succeed, I guess, in bringing the
      Democratic Party back to the center, or to the center, and away from a excessive
      compartmentalization and identity politics and stuff? He thought he was doing that to a considerable
      degree, didn’t he?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Yeah. And I think he did to a certain extent. And I think that he saw some major injustices that
      Democrats weren’t acknowledging. He saw crime as a problem. He saw the welfare system as it existed
      then as a problem. Welfare dependency was a problem. He reformed those. There are places he wouldn’t
      go, though. He wouldn’t abolish affirmative action, and he remained in his gut very sympathetic to
      the various identity movements. But there’s been backsliding since. I remember I did the first
      interview with Hillary Clinton when she became First Lady, and she admitted to me something another
      thing Democrats won’t admit, which is that two parents are better than one. There are a lot of
      heroic single parents, but the sociology on this is irrefutable. 50 years of sociology show that
      intact families are more secure venues for children. And I also should mention at this point in
      terms of my influences, a very big one, my mentor, was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was in effect,
      the left tried to run him out of the Democratic Party because he pointed out that the out-of-wedlock
      birth rate among Black families was alarming. That was in the 1960s. Nowadays, the out-of-wedlock
      birth rate among white families is higher than it was among the Black families in the 1960s. So this
      is a problem Democrats simply will not acknowledge.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Just since we mentioned the Clintons, you were reasonably close to them, you reasonably spent plenty
      of time with them, interviewing them, and I think covering them in the campaign and then in the
      White House, and since, I suppose. Just most of us, 99.9% of us, have not spent personal time with
      the Clintons in that way. What’s the truth? What do you know about them that we should know? What’s
      not true about the caricature or the kind of conventional view of both Bill and Hillary Clinton? I’m
      just curious. We didn’t really plan to talk about this, but I don’t want to miss the chance to get
      you to say a word about it.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, it is interesting. It is interesting. I’ve known them for about 40 years now, and I can’t say
      that I ever had a truly honest conversation with Bill Clinton. I’ve had a lot of off-the-record
      conversations with Bill Clinton. I tried for over the course of those 40 years, because I’m a
      prickly son of a bitch, to raise his hackles, to get him angry. I never could get him angry.
      Hillary, quite the opposite. Hillary, I remember when she was First Lady, I went to South Asia with
      her, mostly because I wanted to see some NGO programs. I wanted to see the Grameen Bank in
      Bangladesh, which provided microloans very successfully for poor women, and she was a vehicle for me
      to get there. And we had this off-the-record conversation, and she started screaming at me because I
      had opposed her healthcare plan. And in fact, I favored the Republican healthcare plan, the Chafee
      plan, which you helped tank, Bill, if I remember correctly?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It came back sort of as Obamacare, right? 15 years later.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      It came back as Romneycare and then as Obamacare. But she and I had this screaming fight, and at the
      end of it, we became friends, and she would invite me to the White House. And in the 1990s, she
      would always be asking me, because she knew I would go out and try and find things that worked, like
      charter schools, for example, and faith-based social programs. And so her first question to me
      always would be, “What programs have you seen lately?” And then when she joined the Senate in 2000,
      and by the way, she never would go to a charter school. She would never go to the phenomenally
      successful Harlem Children’s Zone charter schools. But—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Those are the Eva Moskowitz ones, I think?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Yes. And Geoff Canada, and so on.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. Fantastic success stories, right? Yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      I mean, they are. The test scores, and test scores are important, in the Harlem Children’s Zone
      Charter schools are equivalent to upper-middle-class high schools in the suburbs. So can’t imagine
      why Democrats never, ever, ever talk about that. Could it have something to do with the teacher’s
      unions? But anyway, when she became a senator, and I became obsessed with the military, it was, who
      are you talking to? She knew I was close to General Petraeus. She always wanted to know the latest
      things. And by the way, the feeling was mutual. I once asked Petraeus whether there was any Democrat
      who might be president who had the vaguest idea of how his mind works. That’s another problem I have
      with Democrats, by the way. They have little interest traditionally in the military. Anyway, I asked
      Petraeus this question, and his answer was, “You mean aside from Hillary?” And so you asked for
      surprising things—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, she was on the Senate Armed Services, just to be clear, so he got to know her, I think,
      probably, and she was an active member of the Senate of Armed Services and traveled with McCain and
      stuff, so yeah. She really did have a real interest in military, not just in the military as a kind
      of sociological thing, but an actual policy with regard to the Armed Services.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Yeah. She was really into counterinsurgency. And I wrote one of the early columns. I was against the
      war in Iraq, as you remember all too well. But I thought that once we were there, we had to figure
      out a way to calm things down and leave with some integrity. And so I wrote about counterinsurgency.
      I got a phone call from Petraeus the day after it appeared. I hadn’t met the guy at that point. And
      he said, “You’re on the right track, but you don’t know anything.” And immediately, he sent me 30
      pieces about counterinsurgency that appeared in academic military journals and invited me to come
      out and study with him. He invited me out to Fort Leavenworth. Now, Donald Rumsfeld, who I thought
      was one of the worst secretaries of defense in American history, had sent him out to Fort
      Leavenworth to the think tank there to kind of get rid of him. And that’s where he and his group
      wrote the counterinsurgency strategy, the counterinsurgency manual. So I was in on that from the
      start, and I think that that’s where you and I, Bill, began our journey toward reconciliation
      probably.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes. I remember we’d argued quite a bit over the Iraq war, but then I called for Rumsfeld to be
      fired in ’04, and then we spent all of 2005 and ’06, and even before that, calling for more troops,
      calling for counterinsurgency, at the Weekly Standard, closely working with Senator McCain. We were
      in sync there. And we were correct, it turned out, right? I mean—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Right. Absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … Rumsfeld was stubborn. And Rumsfeld was ridiculously stubborn, or just didn’t care, I suppose.
      Just wanted to get out kind of, and—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      And I thought the selection of Gates was a brilliant one. And in fact, I had a role, a small one, in
      Obama choosing Gates to continue on. But you know, what I said—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s too intriguing. Say a word about that if it’s appropriate. Yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Oh, okay. Well, Gates wrote about it in his memoir, actually.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Okay. So then…
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      What happened was that I did an interview with Obama in 2008, where I asked him would he select
      someone like Gates as a Secretary of Defense? And he said, “Yes, absolutely. I’m thinking about it.”
      And so I called Gates and I said, “Do you have any reaction to this?” And he said, “Yeah.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean, to be clear, Gates is already secretary. Yeah. To keeping Gates on as Secretary of Defense.
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      He was George W.’s Secretary of Defense.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      For the last two years. Yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Yeah. And he was the one who brought Petraeus back to run the show in Iraq. And anyway, Gates said
      to me, “If you print that, I’m going to have to say no. I would never do that. So could you take it
      off the record?” And so what I did, I don’t know how the stands in journalistic ethics, but I think
      that journalists have to be patriots too. And I called Obama back and I said, “Gates says that if
      you say that, he’s not going to be able to say yes.” So Obama said, “Okay. I didn’t say it.” And so
      it didn’t appear in the interview, and we know what happened. And what happened was the right thing.
      And as a journalist, I believe in journalistic ethics. I’ve tried to be a fair journalist over the
      years, especially when I get things wrong, which I’ve done. But to me, journalists also are
      citizens, and I didn’t want to hurt. At that point, I’d gotten very close to the military, as you
      know, and there were lives at stake here. There were kids out there. There was your kid out there in
      Iraq and—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Afghanistan, but yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      He was in Afghanistan?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, a little later.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      With the Marines, right? BILL KRIST0L: Yeah. 2010, 2011. Yeah. 35.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Helmond?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Oof.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      I’ve been to Helmond. Anyway, but enough of that, although I will say this, and I will put in a word
      for an organization that both you and I have had a hand in, which is the Four Country Caucus, which
      is funded by the With Honor PAC, and it is a caucus of post-9/11 veterans who run for the House,
      both Democrats and Republicans. And With Honor gives them funding if they sign a pledge to work
      together as a bipartisan caucus. And there are 30 of them now, and they are my greatest source of
      optimism about this country. They’re just great. And when you talk to him and spend a lot of time
      with him, I’ve continued on the advisory board, it’s just really inspirational. They’re great
      people. We’ve lost some of the best of them like Adam Kinzinger, and we’re losing Mike Gallagher,
      who I thought was very strong. He’s from Wisconsin, but there are people like Jared Golden from
      Maine who is just excellent. And Mikie Sherrill from New Jersey, former helicopter pilot.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So we should talk about that and that’s part of the new center that could emerge. One more
      reminiscence if I can ask you to indulge me in that, and then we’ll get to the current state of the
      Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which the reason Mike Gallagher and Kinzinger and left
      and Gallagher’s going obviously is the state of the Republican Party, so that’s a worrisome thing,
      to say the least. But President Obama, you mentioned him, so I just can’t resist asking. The two big
      triumphant Democrats of our time really are President Clinton and President Obama. Your judgment of
      him? You knew him pretty well. You interviewed him many times, and I think you were pretty early in
      seeing that he was really going to be a rising star?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Yeah, well, drove Hillary crazy that I pretty much supported him. I thought he was a better
      candidate for president than she was. And to finish on Hillary, by the way, she was a lot more fun
      in private. I know other people have said this, but she had a really wicked sense of humor. And by
      the way, she really liked Primary Colors . I will tell one story. At the end of the Clinton…
      Actually, I will tell many stories. I’ll tell stories until—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no, we’ll get to your deep analytical thoughts on the nature of the parties, but keep telling
      stories for a while here. They’re excellent.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      At the end of the Clinton administration, I was working for the New Yorker, and I decided to do a
      piece about what Clinton had actually accomplished because so much of the coverage focused on the
      scandals. And so Clinton found out I was doing this. I was interviewing people from the assistant
      secretary level on up and he said, “I want to be part of this.” And so he gave me lots of time at
      the end of his presidency, and the first thing that he did was a two-hour session on healthcare and
      welfare reform. And at the end of it, Hillary kind of comes in and she asked what we had been
      talking about and I said, “Healthcare.” I said, “He just ripped you to pieces.” And she looked
      stricken. And I said, “No, I’m just kidding.” He was very politic. And he turns to me, we were
      drinking Diet Cokes, as was his want. Those guys, she drank a glass of wine, he would never. But
      anyway, he turns to me and he says, “So why’d you write that book anyway?” And I said, “Well, I saw
      it as a tribute to larger than life politicians,” which was the truth. And she snorted derisively.
      And I said, “Would you rather have a larger than life president or a smaller than life president?”
      And she shook her head. At that point, her choices were two people she absolutely despised, George
      W. Bush and Al Gore. And I said, “Larger than life politicians have larger than life strengths and
      larger than life weaknesses.” She looked at me, she looked at her husband and she shook her head and
      she said, “That’s for sure.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Wow, that’s a great story. Bill Clinton was, just for our younger viewers who don’t understand why
      people like you and to some degree me across the aisle were so interested by Clinton, I would say,
      and impressed by him, he could have a two-hour discussion on healthcare policy and welfare policy,
      couldn’t he, without aids feeding him all the facts or details?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Oh, absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Without descending into bromides and generalizations. That is pretty unusual.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      There are a lot of policy wonks around. Jeb Bush was a policy wonk. He could have a two-hour
      conversation about healthcare and about it. He was smarter on education than any politician I have
      talked to over the last 50 years. But Clinton had this other quality as well. He was perhaps the
      best standup politician I ever encountered. He was just great on the stump. He could, as he once
      said, feel people’s pain. And that’s a major advantage. He also, as Obama later said, was like the
      “explainer in chief.” He could make complicated topics comprehensible to the mass of people in a way
      that they understood. And I think that he was probably the last Democrat to really get a sizable
      white blue collar vote, because I always thought that the fact that he messed around with lounge
      singers and supersized at McDonald’s and felt their pain was an advantage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. Okay, more about Obama, then we’ll get to the deep analysis of the current
      sad moment we’re in. What was President Obama again? How different from the outside perception in
      your dealings with him?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, he was drop-dead smart, and he would have me in to talk about stuff far more often than
      Clinton would, and especially when I would do things like I went to Iran a couple of times. And I
      was in Iran the night after he gave his Cairo speech. Actually for our younger viewers, one of the
      first major moves that Obama did was to try to reconcile with the Islamic world. And I decided to do
      a really weird thing. I went and watched that speech with Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas, who
      was in Damascus, and then had a conversation with him, and couldn’t get him to go anywhere near
      recognition of Israel. Then I got on a plane and went to Tehran, and I went to a party. Parties in
      Tehran are so wild. It’s where people blow off steam.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You know what happens in Tehran should stay in Tehran, Joe. You don’t have to share all of that with
      us.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Although this. On the night that I arrived in Tehran, I got invited to a party. It was a debate
      watching party. This was during the 2009 election that was eventually stolen for Ahmadinejad. And a
      whole bunch of us are watching this debate between various Iranian politicians, which was weird, but
      really interesting. And all of a sudden someone comes in and says, “There are a million people in
      the streets.” And it was the beginning of the Green Movement. And what had happened was that Obama’s
      Cairo speech had been broadcast on BBC Persia with subtitles. And as soon as that was over,
      everybody went into the streets to say, “We want that. That’s what we want.” And so I came back and
      I told Obama that story, and he just completely dismissed me. He didn’t want to hear it. What he
      really wanted was what I had seen there, what the facts were, what so-and-so was like, who so-and-so
      was like. He was the most resistant politician I had ever met to flattery and was interesting in
      that way. But then he kind of disdained politics because of the flattery and the backslapping
      involved. I once had a conversation with Joe Biden about that, and I said, “Why doesn’t he invite
      people over to watch a football game and give him those White House M&Ms that they all crave?” And
      Biden said, “Because he thinks that people will just see through that.” And I said, “Of course,
      they’ll see through it, but they’ll still love it.” And Biden said, “Well, don’t you want to have a
      president who’s more high-minded than we are?” And I said, “No, I want to have a president who’s a
      pol.”

      That’s good. That’s good. Okay. So Biden, it’s good that you mentioned him. So now we’re in the
      current moment, and maybe before we get to Trump, who is the central figure of the current moment,
      so what about the Democrats? I could make a case, just let me make a very brief argument and you can
      refute it or correct it. Biden is governing pretty much as a centrist Democrat? The party is more
      centrist than it has been in quite a while. The younger governors, Whitmer, Shapiro, Polis, et
      cetera, are pretty self-consciously, I would say, centrist and not really of the left, the
      Spanbergers and the Slotkins and the… Mikie Sherrill you mentioned in Congress, Seth Moulton are not
      on the left. The squad gets a lot of attention, but it’s a small number. Is it crazy to think it’s
      going to be a more centrist Democratic Party that escapes some of the problems you’ve seen over the
      last decades, or am I overstating that?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, Bill, I’ve been hoping for that for decades now. By the way, can I ask you where you are? Do
      you have an affiliation these days?

      For a while I was using that excellent Pete Buttigieg line from the 2020 campaign that he wanted the
      support of everyone left, right, progressive, centrist, Democrats, independents, future former
      Republicans, he would say, which I liked. There was a clever… Buttigieg is clever in a way, right? A
      little like Obama maybe in that formulation. No, I’m an ex Republican and I haven’t voted for a
      Republican since Trump emerged, though I did vote for Nikki Haley in the primary here in Virginia.
      It’s an open primary, which I thought it was important to help her get more Republicans accustomed
      to not voting for Trump so they could stay not voting for Trump in November. So I guess I’m an ex
      Republican and I am honestly pretty fine with those moderate Democrats I mentioned. There are a few
      issues where I wish they were a little more respectful of markets, and of unanticipated consequences
      of big government action and some of the things you mentioned earlier, but I can certainly live with
      that Democratic Party.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, I have to say that I’ve voted for Republicans in local elections consistently for the last 40
      years for one reason, which is that the Democrats are controlled by the teacher’s unions and I think
      that the teacher’s unions are a very reactionary force when it comes to educating poor kids, which
      to me, education is a local issue, not a national one, but it is to my mind, absolutely the most
      important issue. Now, as to Biden, that’s one of his failings. He has quietly not encouraged the
      charter school movement. Another one of his failings that I just cannot comprehend, and I am totally
      mystified by this… Another one of his failings is the border situation. Now, I’ve been vehemently
      pro-immigration as I think you have over the years, but at a certain point, the chaos at the border
      is dangerous. It’s also really bad politically. Now, I think that the vast majority of people who
      try to come across are going to become great Americans, the overwhelming majority of them are, and
      the vast majority of refugees should have their cases heard. But I think we need to pause right now.
      And I cannot imagine why Biden didn’t use the State of the Union to declare a national emergency and
      say I’m closing the border, sending elements of the first cavalry and the fourth infantry division
      whose forts are located near the border down there, and I’m suspending all refugee applications at
      the border temporarily until we get this under control.” I think that that’s an instance… Well, you
      saw what trouble he got into when he used the word illegal accurately to describe the guy who
      murdered Laken Riley. I think that he has been a little bit too receptive to the Democratic interest
      groups on the left in that regard. But on the whole, I think the bipartisan stuff that he’s gotten
      through the Congress is remarkable. The Infrastructure Act, the Chips Act, some elements of the
      hilariously named Inflation Reduction Act. I think that his foreign policy, especially when it comes
      to things like Ukraine and NATO and the difficult, near impossible line that he has to walk with
      Bibi Netanyahu, and perhaps we can talk about that, that may be an area where you and I still have a
      little bit of a difference. Huh?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Could be. We could be. Yeah. It’s a complicated area, though.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      It is.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That would be another conversation. We can have a four-hour conversation about that.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      I am very much in favor of Israel’s right to defend itself and I am very much in favor of a two-
      state solution at the same time, which does not include Hamas or terrorists. And I think it’s been a
      difficult walk for Biden to walk, but he’s done it courageously and has lost support in the
      Democratic Party as a result. He may lose the state of Michigan as a result. So I agree with you. I
      think he’s been a very good moderate Democrat president. I also think he’s probably too old for the
      job because when I think about that, I don’t think about where he is now. I don’t think he is
      failing cognitively, I think he’s failing physically. But what is he going to be like when he’s 86?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You think that’s the core of his—just to get to current politics then—Is that where the core of his
      weakness as a presidential candidate in 2024? But also some issues you pointed to, the border and
      sort of the Democrats still not being able to shake. I’m very struck by this that when I say to
      people, including people who will probably end up voting for Biden, what about these governors? What
      about these members? What about TikTok? They’re doing something that’s pretty strong in foreign
      policy if you’re very worried about China, which makes sense to me, I think. And Biden, a little
      hesitance on it because it is a political risk. I mean, tens of millions of Americans like TikTok.
      We’re basically ready to close it down here. But he’s after a little bit of, I’ve got to say
      hesitation on the White House’s part. They stepped up yesterday and said, “Nope, he’ll sign that
      bill. No question about it.” Hopes the Senate moves on it. So he has been a little more courageous
      than people give him credit for, their work sometimes on the illegal thing where he conspicuously
      backs off something and looks a little uncourageous or bowing to the pressure groups. Anyway, a long
      way of saying that, I wonder what is the core of his political weakness? Well, I don’t know if you
      agree with this. I mean, Trump being Trump and the objective numbers we’re seeing in terms of the
      Biden administration, he should be a reasonably strong candidate for… He should be Clinton or Obama
      running for reelection at least, right? He should be a favorite. And the Republicans are pretty
      alienating and pretty some number of their supporters, but he’s not a favorite right now. So what do
      you make of that? How much of it age, how much of it is the Democratic Party and liberalism and all
      that stuff?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, I think that Michael Deaver, who was in charge of imaging for Ronald Reagan taught me
      something which was that, and every politician has followed it ever since, you want as many American
      flags as possible on any given set. And the visual image is always more important almost than the
      words, unless the words are extraordinary. Ronald Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall and
      saying, “Tear down this wall.” For Biden, the overpowering visual image of his presidency is his
      staggering walk across the south lawn to the Marine helicopter. As he takes that walk, you’re
      worried, my heart is in my throat that he’s going to fall over or that he’s going to have to use a
      walker sooner or later. That is the image that most people have in their minds of Joe Biden, and it
      extends to about 80% of the population. I don’t know if there is any way you can counteract that. I
      was hoping that the State of the Union would do that, but apparently in terms of moving the needle
      in the polls, it didn’t do all that much. Although I think a lot of the impressions that people have
      of presidents are subconscious and evolve over time. So I thought the State of the Union was a good
      step toward ameliorating that impression. But that is a big deal. The other big deal is that it’s
      not the economy, stupid, inflation is the only economic… It wasn’t even the economy, stupid when
      James Carville said, “It was the economy, stupid” in 1992, that was an election about vitality and
      Bill Clinton seemed young and vital and really with it. And George H.W. Bush, a wonderful man,
      didn’t remember—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And also a Cold War president after the Cold War ended, right? I think that was a huge part of the
      time for someone to focus on domestic policy. Clinton really sensed that mood out there in a way
      that we certainly didn’t in the Bush White House.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      But I do think that issues like race and transgender, business and education and immigration
      obviously are cultural issues that really are more at the forefront of what people think about than
      things like the debt ceiling or the national debt.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And COVID, I think, had a role there that kind of what I suppose in retrospect was too much
      shutting down of the schools. And so I think it hurt here in Virginia where Youngkin had a surprise
      victory of Terry McAuliffe really just on two issues. McAuliffe had been a pretty good governor,
      honestly, and the state is mostly Democratic, but it was inflation. That was the moment where the
      Biden administration seemed out of touch on that issue. And Youngkin’s most effective ad was that
      going to a supermarket and being surprised. It was an ad, it was filmed, but allegedly being
      surprised by the cost of various things he was buying or other people were buying. Maybe it was a
      third party, but buying them, that person was surprised and saying, “This is terrible.” Then an
      education, but less the critical race theory stuff and more it’s just the schools are not responsive
      to parents and the teacher’s unions are running them. And McAuliffe made the unbelievable mistake of
      having the head of the teacher’s union campaign who was not from Virginia, I mean from out of state,
      Randi Weingarten, campaign with him, and last week it was like, what was he thinking?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      And yes, the closing of the schools, I mean, which was pretty much demanded by the teachers unions,
      was a problem for the Democrats. I mentioned before that Democrats don’t understand the military
      sufficiently. I mean, there was an organization called the Truman Project that was established about
      10 years ago to teach new members of Congress the difference between a battalion and a brigade,
      which Democrats don’t know. But the other thing that Democrats don’t know and don’t appreciate is
      the small business sensibility. And the COVID closings, there was a famous barber in Michigan who
      made a federal case out of this, I think literally, who wouldn’t close his barber shop. And I think
      that those sorts of business people, my dad was one of them, aren’t understood by Democrats
      sufficiently.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Don’t you think some of the movement, which I think is real incidentally of Latinos and Blacks too,
      I think away from the Democratic Party, is a mixture of the cultural and the sort of small business
      sentiment, if I can put it that way?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      There was a poll, I think about six months ago that showed that over 70% of Black voters were
      seriously concerned about crime, and about 23% of white liberals were. I just don’t think that the
      academic left and college graduates who really drive the Democratic Party now understand basic
      things like the importance of crime. Now, crime has gone down, but it’s still a matter of real
      concern. My friend Elaine Kamarck, who is a Brookings scholar, about 10 years ago, I asked her,
      “Well, if Rush Limbaugh and Fox News are running the Republican Party, who’s running the Democratic
      Party these days?” And she said, “The colored girls.” And you know that that’s actually a term that
      Donna Brazile and three of her friends used to describe themselves. They wrote a book a few years
      ago called When Colored Girls Consider Politics , and I think that strong Black women are running
      the Democratic Party now, and they, along with Jim Clyburn, gave us Joe Biden as the candidate in
      2020.

    text: |
      So that’s good. They’re not so radical on these issues, right?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      No, I mean, look, I live in an interracial neighborhood. It’s an upper middle class interracial
      neighborhood, but I used to live in a lower class, Al Sharpton, Spike Lee was my neighbor in
      Brooklyn, and our neighbors were desperately pissed off about crime. The one redeeming factor that
      we had on our street was that three Black cops lived there and they were armed.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. Yeah, that’s interesting.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      But notions like “defund the police,” which never really had very much traction in the Democratic
      Party, but it doesn’t need to have very much traction for Republicans to take advantage of it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Meanwhile, we have a Trump dominated Republican Party. We have to come back to this in another
      conversation because this has been so interesting about the Democrats and their past and I guess
      their present. Well, let me just close on the Democrats since we may have to have a second
      conversation anyway, so where do you think they stand? What happens, I guess, this year? But we’ve
      talked, that’s an election, who knows, right? Pretty close. But what about 2025? Are we going
      towards a 9/11 veteran Abigail Spanberger, Mikie Sherrill, Democratic Party, or are we going towards
      a, what James Carville calls an Amherst faculty lounge Democratic Party? What’s the balance of
      power? What would you look to sort of judge… Well, will it have to be fought out? I mean, how does
      that work, do you think?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, I think that a lot of it is going to depend on what the Republican Party becomes. I think that
      a point of agreement that you and I have is that there is a crying need for a moderate conservative
      political party in America. That is where solidity lies. That is where tradition lies, and our
      tradition of democracy is the greatest in human history. And if the Republicans remain a Trump cult,
      then I think that there are two possibilities… And by the way, I think the members of the squad,
      although I happen to be represented by a terrible one, Jamaal Bowman, he’s my congressman. He’s
      being primaried, thank God, by a moderate. There’s a possibility that the Democrats can move in that
      direction. But there are all these countervailing forces, the “Amherst faculty lounge” forces. My
      fantasy for a long time has been a third party that builds from the bottom up that includes people
      like Abby Spanberger, but also Adam Kinzinger. My great fantasy was that when the Republicans were
      having the speaker fight, that our bipartisan military caucus would put forward a bipartisan
      candidate for speaker, namely Steve Womack, a Republican of Arkansas who’s widely respected on both
      sides of the aisle. And we would start a centrist rebellion that can still happen now over Ukraine.
      And if… I am really rooting for one of these discharge petitions to make it to the house floor so
      that you can get a centrist majority, which absolutely exists to support funding for Ukraine, that
      is an absolute moral necessity. But if things like that begin to happen, I think it’s not impossible
      that we could see a moderate third party. Of course, that is wishful thinking in the extreme, and I
      would… Well, let me turn it to you, Bill. What do you think? Do you think that the Republicans are a
      hopeless cult in perpetuity?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, just for the next few years, but certainly for this year. And I think it’s hard to recover from
      eight years of following Trump. I mean, it’s not like it happened for just a few months or even
      three or four years, like Joe McCarthy and he was president and then three times nominee. That’s
      rare in American politics. So I don’t think you snap back. Even if he loses, even if he loses fairly
      badly, which I don’t think will happen unfortunately this November. I don’t think people snap back
      from that immediately. A large number of politicians have made their career by being mini-Trumps of
      one kind or another, or at least accommodating Trump so much, they can’t quite walk away from it. I
      could see that though two or four years from now, and I think it could begin to happen even in ’25,
      and then the Democrats could have their own depending on whether Biden wins or loses. But I think in
      either case, the way I think about it is in very different ways, Biden, Trump are quarks in the
      bottle, stopping the normal progress or whatever the metaphor is here, the normal fermentation or
      something of the party. There are a lot of interesting people in both parties and they’re just
      stifled by these two older candidates, at least, who are dominating it. And one is the president and
      the other is the former president, and again, the nominee. So I think it’s very unpredictable what
      happens in ’25. I could imagine a big fight within the Democratic Party. I could imagine the third
      party stuff really exploding in ’25. I don’t think it’s totally… So let me turn it back to you. Is
      it totally out of the question that it still happens in ’24? I mean, country is—

      I think Bobby Kennedy is a serious player depending on how many states he gets on the ballot. I
      think that he has great appeal among younger people. His combination of environmentalism and kind of
      independence, aside from his wacky conspiracy theories, I think he could be a factor. But what I’d
      really kind of like to see, another fantasy is that in New York we used to have, they still do have
      the Liberal Party, which was never all that liberal. It was a labor union party and the Liberal
      Party would choose to run its own candidates for some offices and support Democrats in other offices
      and even occasionally support Republicans like Jacob Javits, ancient history there. Nelson
      Rockefeller was a Liberal party nominee. And I think that if there was a really judicious third way
      moderate movement like that, that would support its own candidates in some places, support Democrats
      in other places, support Republicans in other places, I would love to see if something like that
      could get traction.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So that works in New York because of fusion voting so that you can support a candidate from another
      party and the votes get fused. They get counted together. And so Bloomberg even won the mayoralty by
      being on three tickets, as I recall, at least once or twice, and getting Republican votes, I think
      liberal votes and then independent party that he invented and paid for votes. That’s illegal in most
      of the country. I’m actually slightly involved in an effort to broaden the fusion, get the fusion
      idea back again. It was once legal in most of the country. It turns out, I hadn’t really realize
      this late 19th-century American politics is full of fusion efforts, like in many states, the
      populist party or the progressive party where it would nominate a Republican or a Democrat who would
      also be the candidate of that party. It would be a signal to some chunk of voters that that’s the
      more, let’s say, populist candidate or progressive and that candidate might win. Sometimes they
      would nominate their own kind of protest candidates. It would be much healthier. I do think fusion
      is one of the reforms, maybe more than some of those other voting reforms that we’re familiar with
      that really could change American politics, probably has to be done state by state. People are
      trying to do it in some other states now. So that’s something to keep in… That kind of stuff could
      really explode a little bit, maybe after going through seven or eight months here of Trump versus
      Biden. I feel like people do not think the system is producing what it should be in terms of the—

    text: |
      Well, I would be wildly in support of that. Let me know about the group and [inaudible] —
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I will. They’re in New York. When you’re back up there, we’ll all get together. Say a word about, I
      mean Trump, I mean just how extraordinary a phenomenon is it in your mind or is it kind of more the
      same we’ve seen it in American politics before? What is distinctive about the moment?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Well, I think Trump is probably… Well, first of all, I’ve known the guy for 40 years. I covered real
      estate development—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I forgot, the New York, yeah.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      …in New York back in the 80s. And I can tell you that he was a joke to all of his fellow developers.
      He was not considered a major player. He was considered a major marketer. And we are living through
      the golden age of marketing if this is the golden age of anything. And I think that it was
      inevitable that the American people would begin to mistake reality TV for reality. I think that in…
      Maggie Haberman wrote a book about Trump and there was this one anecdote that really hit home to me.
      She was talking to a middle-aged, middle-class guy in Iowa who had attended one of Trump’s rallies,
      which are wall-to-wall meshugas . The guy can’t put three coherent sentences together in order
      unless they’re about him. But in any case, Haberman asks this middle-aged middle-class guy, why he’s
      a Trump supporter. And the guy says, “Because I watched him build his business,” he was referring to
      the TV show, The Apprentice . He had mistaken that for Trump’s business. And I think an awful lot of
      people out there are doing it. I’ve just been reading this book that I would recommend, you should
      never do an hour of one of these without recommending a book, someone else’s book. And I’m going to—

    text: |
      No, Tim Alberta’s book, The Kingdom, The Power and the Glory about evangelicals, and it is an
      incredibly sad story because I was very much moved in the 1990s by people you knew well, Pete Wehner
      and Mike Gerson and David Kuo, who were involved in the faith-based movement and joined the George
      W. Bush administration in the 2000s. And there is a humility to real evangelism. There is a
      loveliness to followers of Christ. And what Tim Alberta does in this book is show how the movement
      was hijacked by hustlers, how Tim Alberta’s father was an evangelical minister, and when he passed,
      his successor got into real trouble because he wouldn’t talk Trumpian politics because that sold. It
      was all about the trinkets. All you have to do is get Trump’s emails every day and he’s selling
      something or other, most famously sneakers, but also credit cards. It is American politics reduced
      to raw hucksterism. And cynics will say, well, it was always like that. But I’ve always said that
      cynicism is what passes for insight among the mediocre. And I think that Trump says something about
      the rest of us, and it isn’t something flattering and it has to do, I think back to my obsession
      with the military, I think that there’s a need, democracy ain’t easy and there is a need for public
      service. And there is a need for more people to feel the way the military feels, which is that
      they’re part of something larger than themselves. And as I’ve traveled the country, which I’ve done
      an awful lot, I’ve seen that sense of community diminish over the years. By the way, the evangelical
      church was a mainstay of that. There were all these kinds of community groups and helping the poor
      groups that came out of evangelical churches and still do, but they’ve been hijacked by hucksters.
      And I think that one of the things that I’ve always been tremendously in favor of, which we’ll never
      get because this is in a country that lacks mandates, but I’ve always been in favor of mandatory
      national service, especially for college graduates. It should be the only way you can pay off your
      college loans and it should extend beyond the military into teaching, policing, social work,
      medicine, even architecture. You shouldn’t be able to be a licensed architect unless you spend a
      couple of years as a building inspector because those guys are the most corrupt people in
      government. But anyway, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no, that’s so interesting. And I think your point about national unity and sense of community
      versus the kind of hucksterism. I mean, I guess the other side of Trump and just to take a minute on
      that and then we’ll have to maybe we’ll end and come back to a lot of this in two or three, four
      months when the campaigns further along, and we can also have much your experienced observer of
      campaigns that talk actual sort of practical politics of Trump and Biden. But I mean Trump has
      combined the kind of pure hucksterism with a kind of less McCarthy-ite, George Wallace demagoguery
      exploitation of people’s insecurities, dislike of minority groups, and fears about cultural change
      in a way that’s, I guess pretty unusual. I feel like we’ve had the demagogues, we’ve had the
      hucksters, Trump has brought them together. And I think you and I, reading your “Sanity Clause,” you
      respect, I mean, respect maybe could … you understand that Trump is a smart, an effective demagogue.
      A clever demagogue, which I think so many liberals, so many opponents of Trump, including many of my
      friends in never Trump world, they just want to dismiss him. He’s clownish. He can’t put three
      sentences together as you said, but he is a shrewd demagogue, don’t you think?

      Oh, I think he is incredible. I mean, the line that sticks out and he has used this sort of thing,
      time and again, was about the proud boys, stand back and stand by. I mean, he always comes right up
      to the edge of outrage, crosses it, maybe sticks a toe on the other side of it, but can always say,
      go fight like hell at the Capitol, but do it peacefully. I mean, he knows how to do that. He knows
      it viscerally. I don’t know that the guy has much of an inner life. I don’t think he does. I don’t
      think he considers what to say all that much, but I think he has an inherent sense of what the
      traffic will bear in a way that few other politicians I’ve ever seen have.

      Yeah, he didn’t go down that DeSantis rabbit hole of attacking hugely popular American institutions,
      Disney and the NFL, right? He’s always pretty … he did a little of it, but then he was careful to
      be, “I’m great buddies with Tom Brady. Let’s have the football teams over.” He wants to associate
      himself with as all good hucksters and con men do with what’s popular. Whereas, DeSantis sort of
      believed the kind of right wing online propaganda that we’re really in a culture war against these
      major American institutions.
  - speaker: Joe Klein

      Right. And obviously he won’t go there on places like social security and Medicare, which I think is
      a place that he probably should go and we should go in very modest ways. I mean, you can raise the
      retirement age from 67 to 68 or 69, and not really grievously harm a lot of people, especially those
      of us who are much older than that now.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, right. I mean the TikTok thing we’re talking was the March 14th. I mean, the house voted
      yesterday. Trump probably partly driven by donor considerations and backed off what had been a major
      talking point of his, I think it was three years ago that he was going to get tough on companies
      like TikTok. But I think a lot of it was politics. I think he is in touch with enough people who
      said, hey, tens of millions of people use TikTok. They like it. They don’t really understand the
      argument about Chinese information operations, which I think is a convincing argument, but that
      hasn’t been made very much publicly explained to them. And they’re just going to think that, “the
      government’s like, arbitrarily taking away one of my favorite pastimes,” and more than a pastime in
      some cases… “It’s things I really enjoy and learn from.” I think in that respect, again, I think
      he’s a little bit clever, like a fox. The idea that this was, oh, shows just how weak he is and how
      can he not be on board with this thing. I kind of wonder, I worry that he’s almost ahead of the
      curve in shying away from shutting down TikTok, not being foolish.
  - speaker: Joe Klein

      Well, you look at the positions he’s taken, social security and Medicare, he was way ahead of the
      curve on immigration and he was way ahead of the curve in liberating the Republican Party from Iraq.
      Now, you and I both think, I don’t want to speak for you, but that there needs to be an American
      presence in the world, that things like Ukraine are very important. NATO is very important. Not
      allowing, standing up against authoritarianism, is very important. But the Republican Party was
      ready to admit that Iraq probably wasn’t the most judicious thing to do, and now he’s taking it very
      much to a fault.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, a very dangerous place. Let me close on this. Are you sort of amazed, I guess I am about the
      ability, his ability, but also now the entire conservative movement’s ability, a lot of the
      Republican Party’s ability to memory-hold January 6th. I guess I really did think after January 6th,
      this is what we got from Trump, but maybe this is the wake-up call. I didn’t think miraculously the
      Republican Party would become wonderful again, but I didn’t expect that three years later he’d be
      coasting to renomination. The orthodoxy in the party would not be a kind of minimizing of January
      6th. It would almost be a praising of January 6th. Liz Cheney, who tried to tell the truth about
      January 6th, total and utter outcast, Kinzinger gone from Congress. I mean, just say a word about
      maybe in conclusion, I don’t want to end on a down note, but what does that say about just the utter
      forgetfulness of what was kind of a big deal, an important, genuinely important event in American
      history?
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      I don’t know that the word I’d use would be forgetfulness. I think cowardice is the word I’d use.
      And I have been so disappointed in so many Republicans, including members of the bipartisan caucus
      who aren’t willing to stand up on that. Kinzinger was an exception. By the way, I talked to one
      member of our caucus, a woman who was a Republican from Iowa who voted against Jim Jordan for
      Speaker of the House. And as a consequence, eight of the 12 Republican County committees in her
      district censured her. So I think that the question is how badly do these people want to be part of
      something so reprehensible? How deluded can they be? And these include people I tremendously
      respect, former… I mean someone like Lamar Alexander who was a moderate, sensible, conservative
      candidate for president, senator from Tennessee, why is he so silent these days? Why has he said
      nothing about Trump? And there are plenty of others like him, people both you and I respect. It’s
      just, I mean, to end on a depressing note, that is really depressing.

      Okay, we’ll have to have another conversation soon to end on an uplifting note. But no, I think
      there was plenty of uplifting possibilities about the future in this conversation. And we’ve got to
      a face reality, right? Cynicism is a cheap out, but also wishfulness is a cheap out. And we’re in a
      moment, as you say, where some of this says something about the America we’re living in, but maybe
      not something forever and maybe not something decisive. So read Joe Klein, read “Sanity Clause” and
      read Primary Colors for that matter. Is it still in print or can I—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Oh, of course. I have seven books that are still in print.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Wow, okay. I typically buy the cheap used copies. However, these days you don’t have to get the
      royalties to Joe. So no, I—
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      You don’t have to, but it’d be nice.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Joe Klein, thank you for joining me.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      Hey, and Bill, thank you for a lifetime of thoughtfulness. I think that when I first met you, you
      were working for Bill Bennett.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, at the education department in the ’80S.
  - speaker: Joe Klein
    text: |
      And I really felt an affinity for you from the very start. We’ve had our rocky moments, but I think
      that we come from the same part of the jungle.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think so. And we’ll both be looking for figuring out where to go into exile after Trump wins in
      November. I hope you’re exploring some nice places that we can get to get refuge. But anyway, Joe,
      thank you very much for joining me, and thank you all for joining us on Conversations . View the
