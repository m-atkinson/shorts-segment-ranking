      Hi, I am Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again,
      amazingly, I looked it up for the 5th time since the war in Ukraine began, by Fred Kagan, who’s been
      an invaluable guide to understanding the war as it’s gone through its different phases. Fred is a
      senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, runs its Critical Threats Project and is a major
      contributor to the Institute for the Study of War, ISW’s daily updates on the situation in Ukraine,
      which are must-reading and I’m sure all of you are reading already, but you can read them for free
      by just subscribing to ISW. So Fred Kagan, thanks for joining me again.

      It’s great to be back with you, Bill.

      We last spoke in September. We were, I think, hopeful that the aid package would move soon and you
      had an analysis of the war that slightly wasn’t dependent on that, but assumed that that might
      happen, didn’t happen and now, it’s finally happened. Where do we stand? How much of a price have we
      paid, have the Ukrainians paid for not having the aid they could have had for the last five, six
      months? But, how does the war stand on the ground?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      So the Russians began of their own offensive operations as the Ukrainian counteroffensive wound down
      in the fall. And as the likelihood of renewed US aid dropped, the Russians began really leaning into
      their offensive operations because they saw an opportunity. It’s not clear to me if the Kremlin
      decided that it actually had broken our will, or certainly Putin thought that he might have. And I
      think that that did encourage him. But mainly I think the Russian military and the Kremlin saw an
      opportunity in what was going to be a dip in availability of Ukrainian resources and leaned into
      that. As the Ukrainians began seriously to run out of ammunition, artillery, and air defense
      interceptors, mainly in the late winter, the Russians really started leaning into their offensive
      operations. And, they launched offensives all up and down the eastern side of the line from the
      Kupyansk area near Kharkiv Oblast, down to the Donetsk city area and Avdiivka. The Russians did a
      bunch of things that allowed them to take advantage of the reduction in Ukrainian available
      munitions. And it’s important not to underestimate the Russians here. It’s important not to
      overestimate them, but it’s important not to underestimate them. They did make a number of important
      tactical adaptations, and one was that they mass produced and kitted out their bombs with these
      glide bomb kits, and they developed the tactics to have their fighter bombers take advantage of the
      loss of Ukrainian air defense over the front lines. As Ukraine ran out of interceptors and
      concentrated them around Kyiv, Ukrainians had to pull it back from the front line, and the Russians
      started using glide bombs against Ukrainian frontline units at a scale that we’ve never seen before
      in this war. At the same time, as Russian artillerymen had anywhere from six to 10 to one advantages
      in shell count over their Ukrainian defenders, and the Russians put those advantages to good use.
      And, they would use the glide bomb attacks to just pulverize Ukrainian defensive positions and they
      would use their artillery to do the same. They adapted their tactics a little bit, and that’s what
      allowed them to take Avdiivka. And that is what has allowed them to push west out of Bakhmut, and to
      continue the attacks around Avdiivka and elsewhere along the line, as the Ukrainians have entered a
      period where they just don’t have anything to shoot back with. And, we’ve had…
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, really was serious, the cut off of the aid, I mean, it wasn’t just like on the margin.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      No.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      A little bit of, they had to adjust one or two things.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      No, it was just—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It was just the Russians got better, though, that—
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah, it’s devastating. It was absolutely devastating. We’ve seen reports in various western outlets
      interviewing Ukrainian soldiers and they would say, “Russians would send 10, 12 tanks at us.” “We
      would have one or two rounds to shoot at them and after that, it was machine guns.” “And, you’re not
      stopping tanks and armored vehicles with machine guns.” And the bombing really has been devastating
      and that’s because the Ukrainians ran out of interceptors. If you remember that brief flurry, when
      the Ukrainians were shooting down some Russian fighter bombers around Avdiivka, that showed that the
      Ukrainians, when they have, our long-range air defense can keep the Russians away from the lines.
      But as they ran out of interceptors, they had to ration and pull back from the front and that opened
      us up. So that’s created a situation, where the Russians are making what we call, incremental
      tactical gains, particularly around Avdiivka. And, that’s because the Russians managed to collapse
      the Ukrainian pocket that the Russians had created there. And the Ukrainians were not as well-
      prepared as they might’ve been to hold the subsequent defensive line and the Russians have been
      leaning into that or reinforcing that effort. The Russians are going to continue to gain ground
      there. I’m not that alarmed about it right now, because there’s not that much out there. So, the
      Russians have to go pretty far before that really becomes a significant breakthrough, other than
      just gaining territory. What I’m more alarmed about is the Russian drive west from Bakhmut toward
      the town of Chasiv Yar, which is a linchpin to what we call the fortress belt. There’s a belt of
      cities in Eastern Ukraine, the southernmost of which is Kostiantynivka, and then Kramatorsk, which
      some people have heard about, Slavyansk, which the Ukrainians defended against the Russian drive in
      2022. And Chasiv Yar is among those. It’s not clear that the Russians won’t be able to take Chasiv
      Yar, that would be very significant and that would put them in a good position to challenge that
      fortress belt for the first time since 2022. Fighting’s paused around there for now, but I think
      we’re going to see a renewed Russian offensive. So the bottom line is that we’ve got two major
      Russian drives going on right now, one of them is making ground, but it’s not ground that matters a
      ton at the moment. The other of which is a little slow right at the moment, but it’s more
      operationally significant. So the phase we’re in is, we’re rushing to get supplies to the
      Ukrainians, Ukrainians are going to rush to get it to the front line. I think the Ukrainians will be
      able to stabilize the line relatively soon in the coming weeks for various reasons that I could go
      into. As the materiel begins to arrive, I think the Ukrainians will be able to weather this
      particular drive without losing too much more. Chasiv Yar being the big question mark. But then,
      we’re onto the next challenge and the next—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What’s the timeframe of these phases now? So this is a sort of May, June thing, what you’ve been
      describing?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Well, I think if the Ukrainians haven’t been able to stabilize this particular set of drives within
      the next couple of weeks, I think we’ll have a problem. I think it’s going to take… President Biden
      only signed the bill into law on Wednesday, so it’s not even been a week Tuesday.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We’re speaking Tuesday April 30th. I should clarify for people who might be watching it a little
      later. But yeah, less than a week after.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah, it’s not even been a week. It takes time. Even if we had everything loaded up on rail cars, it
      takes time to get them into Ukraine. It takes time to get them to the front line and takes time for
      that to have an effect. So, I would think sometime in the next couple of weeks, I would expect and
      hope to see the Ukrainians starting to stabilize the lines against this attack. But, the Russians
      are also preparing more significant offensive operations. Timing for those is a little bit less
      clear, we’ve heard Ukrainian estimates ranging from late May to June or even July, depends on
      exactly what conditions the Russians are trying to set and what risks they’re trying to take. But
      the Russians have built up a lot of reserves and they are holding forces in reserve, in preparation
      for those offensive operations. So I think odds are, sometime in mid to late May, June, we’ll see
      the start of another major Russian offensive operation and the Ukrainians will have to weather that.
      There are some alarming things or potentially alarming things that we’re seeing, the Russians are
      building a group of forces in Belgorod Oblast, which is the Russian area directly north of Kharkiv.
      And Ukrainians are talking about Russians preparing to drive on Kharkiv City, again, which they have
      not done since 2022. I’m personally skeptical that the Russians are going to be able to put together
      a large enough force really to threaten to take the city against equipped Ukrainian defenders, but
      that will draw Ukrainian forces away from other parts of the front and make defending against the
      whole thing challenging. So, I think we’re going to see a series of Russian offensives probably
      rippling across the front starting in late May and running through August, September, that the
      Ukrainians are going to have to receive and stop. So, I think the summer is going to be a Russian
      offensive summer.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So, a rough summer and…
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But sounds like you think the Ukrainians, the odds are the front doesn’t collapse and they have to
      give some ground and take casualties, of course, and all that, but not a disaster.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah. I don’t think… I’m really pretty confident the Ukrainians are not going to lose Kharkiv or any
      major city and that the front is not going to collapse. And we’ll see what ground and troops they
      lose. But I think I’m pretty confident with the aid package coming in, also with things, and we can
      talk about this more, that the Ukrainians are doing to address their own manpower problems. I’m
      pretty confident the Ukrainians are going to weather the Russian summer offensive without having
      really terrible things happen.
  - speaker: Bil Kristol
    text: |
      And this brutal, I guess, bombing campaign against civilian sites all over the place, Odessa and
      elsewhere, that too, they can and will have to weather, how important is that strategically?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      So the brutality against civilians is, these are war crimes and very serious things. They’re not
      going to break Ukraine will to fight. That’s just unnecessary evil. The part of the strategic
      bombing campaign, because basically what this missile campaign is, is its strategic bombing campaign
      done with missiles and drones. The part of it that is problematic is the attack on the Ukrainian
      energy infrastructure, which has been devastatingly effective. And that’s bad in all kinds of ways.
      And also now, of course, the Russians are striking rail facilities and other things to try to hinder
      the arrival of the aid. I think it’s too soon to tell how effective that will be. But hopefully,
      some of the first aid that’s going to be arriving is going to be Patriot interceptors, which can
      help the Ukrainians defend against these attacks. Because it really has been, I mean, the things
      that have gotten… The artillery shortages have been very bad, but as the Ukrainians been running out
      of interceptors, that’s what’s been terrifying. And it’s one of the reasons why I really started
      hopping up and down about the aid package, I and others. Because if the Ukrainians actually ran out
      of interceptors, we could be having a Aleppo going on. I mean, we could actually start to have
      Russian man bombers over Ukrainian cities and that was a real danger. That’s not going to happen
      with the aid package that we have now. So, I think the Ukrainians will be able to go back to
      shooting down a higher percentage of the missiles and defending this infrastructure. But the
      Russians have gotten better, they’ve gotten better with targeting. They’ve figured out what kind of
      target, what kind of missile packages work, so it’s going to be tough. But the inflow of aid will, I
      think, help the Ukrainians get this back under control.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So there’ll be a rough summer and we’ll know at some point, sounds like what? Whether basically,
      it’s rough, but manageable or rough, but really dangerous, even more dangerous. That’s presumably
      what? Midsummer or…
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      August.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      August.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      I think by August, we’ll have a good sense of where this is headed.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And even if it’s manageable, if I can use that term in a war, but survivable, still the Ukrainians
      don’t have any… still are just playing defense and trying to stabilize the situation, it sounds
      like—
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Through the summer, yeah
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Through the summer, yeah.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      …through the summer, yeah. Now, after that, things start to get interesting, because the Russians
      don’t have limitless manpower, they don’t have limitless military capacity, they are mobilizing what
      they’re going to mobilize for this year and they’re going to presumably hurl it into these offensive
      operations. And I do think the Ukrainians will hold the offensives, hold the lines. As a defender,
      you have some opportunities when you’ve stopped an attack, depending on your own capabilities and
      your own resources. And on the one hand, you can just wipe your brow, and recover yourself and think
      about what’s coming next. You can also, however, take advantage of the fact that an enemy whose
      attacks have failed, tends to be disorganized and offer opportunities for counter strokes. And I
      think the later we get into the year, the more possible it is to think about Ukrainians conducting
      counterattacks into stalling Russian offensive operations and starting to regain a little bit of the
      initiative on the battlefield. This is what the Ukrainians are talking about doing. It’s hard to see
      past the event horizons of the offensives to assess whether they’re going to be able to do that or
      not. There’s a lot of variables there. Militarily, in terms of how our military operations work,
      it’s very plausible. So it’s, option number one is that we get into the fall, into the early fall
      and Ukrainians actually are able to begin conducting some limited counterattacks, maybe very small
      counteroffensives to take advantage of failing Russian attacks. Or alternatively, the Russian
      attacks peter out and the Ukrainians take advantage of what should be getting to the climax of the
      inflow of this aid package and other European aid packages, as well as addressing their own
      manpower, challenges as I’ve said, and prepare possibly for a winter offense, counteroffensive… That
      would be optimistic. I can see other scenarios possibly more realistic, in which the Ukrainians
      focus on a spring counteroffensive. But they definitely intend to launch it counteroffensive. And as
      bad as things look at the moment, it’s still very conceivable to see how the Ukrainians could launch
      a counteroffensive and begin to take back territory, either late this year or into next year.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. And we haven’t discussed yet, and I will maybe this is the transition, but we can come
      back to some of the things we’ve been talking about too, which we’re talking about what’s happening
      on the front and assuming, I guess, the current… What should we call them? Rules of engagement,
      constraints of engagement that have been imposed or just necessary, in terms of what Ukraine’s done
      and stuff. I mean, how important is that? I mean, people talk about it a lot, “If only we had
      allowed Ukraine to do X, Y, provided them certain weapons that were longer range, not tried to stop
      them from attacking within Russia and so forth.” A, does that all matter that much over the next few
      months at least? And B, is some of that going to change or should it change?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Well, let’s talk about the issue of sanctuary first. I think it’s important for US decision makers
      and people who are in the policy space to reflect on why we think it’s such a good idea to establish
      the principle that aggressors get to have sanctuary in their own countries as they commit
      aggression. Why it is that we are taking the position that there’s some reason why the Ukrainians
      should not be striking targets in Russia when Russia invaded them. This is contrary to international
      law. You are absolutely allowed to attack the territory of a country that has invaded you, and it’s
      contrary to all military sense. Of course, we have the same discussions about Iran. The Iranians
      have been killing Americans. And now, by proxy Israelis for a long time they’ve attacked our Saudi
      allies, other Arab allies, and we’ve taken the position that nobody should fire a shot into Iran.
      Are we going to extend that principle to China, by the way? If the Chinese attack Taiwan, are we
      going to take the position that we can’t hit the Chinese mainland, which would be the logical
      extension of this? So I actually think we really need to reflect on why we think this is a principle
      that we want to be defending. In this specific case, I am less enthusiastic about the Ukrainian
      strikes on Russian energy infrastructure because I think the net effect of that is going to be
      limited. I’m very enthusiastic about the Ukrainian strikes on Russian airfields. If you think about
      this, it’s kind of crazy. Russians are flying sorties from military airfields to bomb Ukrainian
      cities. Ukrainians have the wherewithal, and we could give them more to strike those legitimate
      military targets, and we’ve been unhappy about that. That makes no sense at all. The Ukrainians have
      been doing it anyway, and that’s really good to see and I hope that they’ll do more of it because
      they can’t stop the Russians from flying, but they can make it harder and that’s something that’s
      worth doing. So I would hope that the US administration would rethink its position on Ukrainian
      strikes, especially on legitimate Russian military targets that have an immediate impact on Russia’s
      ability to attack Ukraine and Ukrainian cities. Because I’d actually think that that is very
      important, and our hostility to that is pretty indefensible. The Russians are not going to use
      tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine because the Ukrainians hit military airfields, and the Russians
      are for sure not going to go to war with NATO because the Ukrainians hit angles base two, that’s
      nonsense.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The Russians aren’t going to use nuclear weapons, presumably if we increase the Ukrainian’s capacity
      to do these things that they are doing anyway incidentally, but in limited ways, right?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah. I mean, this whole… Look, I don’t want to poo-poo the escalation thing. I’ve never wanted to
      poo-poo the escalation thing. Anytime you’re dealing with major nuclear power that is talking about
      nuclear weapons, you have to take it very seriously. But first of all, all along as you recall in
      all of our previous conversations, I’ve said Putin is not an apocalyptic actor who’s going to
      embrace nuclear war rather than defeat. That’s proved to be true. He’s not looking at defeat right
      now anyway. He’s not going to use nuclear weapons lightly. And all of the red lines that we’ve been
      told were red lines have proven not to be red lines. Doesn’t mean none of them will be, but I think
      we really need to move past this particular extreme fear of escalation and understand we are helping
      the Ukrainians do something that’s unacceptable to the Russians in principle, which is survive,
      okay? Well, the Russians are living with that because the alternatives are worse for them.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And how much of a price have we paid and are we paying for what, I take it, you view and many do as
      excessive self-deterrence and fear of escalation and not providing certain weapons systems to the
      Ukrainians. Has it been on the margin? Has it been important? Is it now going forward even more
      important? How does one judge that?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      There’s a lot of sunk risk already and sunk cost in that self-deterrence that is just, it’s why
      we’ve been a day late and weapons system short this entire war. The Ukrainians should have scores of
      M1 tanks by now, they don’t. That was a whole part of an earlier risk calculation. They should be
      flying F-16s by now. They’re not. Why was that? That was part of this risk calculation. The long-
      range strike, the ATACMs and things that we’re talking about are just the next iteration of our
      hesitance to provide the Ukrainians with weapons. I think we are providing them with the ATACMs. I
      think we’re going to give them the ATACMs now. I expect we’re still going to have the same
      restraints that we’ve put on them about hitting targets in Russia proper, which again, I don’t think
      make any sense. In the case of the ATACMs, I don’t know how significant that is because I’m not sure
      that that would be the optimal use of those systems anyway. I mean, we can’t just point to one
      system and talk about the self-deterrence. This is the part of the reason the Ukrainians are in the
      problem that they’re in is because it was apparent in early 2022—and we wrote this—it was apparent
      that we were going to have to start sending the Ukrainians tanks. It was apparent that we were going
      to have to start sending them correct planes. It was apparent we were going to have to start sending
      them patriots. We were months, in some cases years behind doing those things, and that has shaped
      the course of the conflict in a significant way. And the current discussions are just an extension
      of that. The administration has got to get past this incrementalism that it has had, and we have to
      get over our hesitations about providing Ukraine with the weapons of war that it needs.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And is the administration getting past it in your judgment?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      It’s really not clear. It’s really not clear. The administration hasn’t said much about what it’s
      going to do differently with this package or whether it’s going to do anything differently with this
      package. This is a much larger package than any previous package. Now, that’s largely because it was
      meant to be passed in the fall and cover the entire period to the election. It’s going to be
      interesting to see what the effect of the delay is because now we’re actually going to, in
      principle, flood Ukraine with what was meant to be a year’s worth of weapons right now, but I don’t
      know. It’s really been surprising how little the administration has said about what they’re going to
      do and whether they’re going to do anything differently, and to me, that’s a little bit alarming
      actually. I would really have hoped for a statement from the administration to make it clear that
      they are really now serious and that they’re really going to lean into helping Ukraine stabilize the
      lines and liberate its territory, and we are going to do things differently from the way that we’ve
      done before. I haven’t really heard that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. You’d think that the overwhelming passage really at the end of the day of the aid package for
      Ukraine in both houses would be the occasion for the president to both welcome that, to talk about
      the bipartisan supports, do his best to liberate as much of the Republican Party and Republican
      voters for that matter, from let’s say the America First side of the party as possible. And then
      maybe also lean forward further since at this point, I mean a lot of the criticism he was getting
      from those Republicans, some of it disingenuous, some of it real, I think sincere was, “You’re not
      doing enough,” and that was combined slightly weirdly with, and therefore some of them weren’t going
      to vote for the aid, but whatever, but they said it and it was out there. And so I am also very
      struck by the… It’s only a week, but the relative silence of the President and the administration
      after this big moment, you would think, in what they’ve described as a decisive inflection point in
      US foreign policy and in the world’s shaping of the 21st century global order and all that.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah. There’s a bunch of important points in there, Bill, that I think are worth teasing out.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Please.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      First of all, everyone’s focused on the fact that a narrow majority of Republicans voted against the
      aid to Ukraine.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      A slight majority of Republicans, if you add the Senate, Republicans voted for the whole thing, so…
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah. I’m being in that the-
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      In the House a majority against. So it’s 50/50, let’s just say.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      …yeah. But the vote was well over two-thirds of the house and over three-quarters of the Senate,
      which is a massive endorsement. And there are good reasons to be worried, and there are good reasons
      to focus on the things that people are focusing on. But in the ordinary course of events, you would
      look at a vote like that and say, “This is a terrific referendum on American support for aid to
      Ukraine, to have huge bipartisan majorities in both houses pass a controversial aid bill. It’s a
      really big deal.” And how did that happen? Well, it happened because Speaker Johnson took a
      courageous position. You could criticize him for having taken a long time to get there, and I
      understand all the caveats there, but at the end of the day, he did take a very courageous decision.
      He stared down a threat to be fired, dealt with a very, very challenging situation, and made
      something very hard happen in this massively bipartisan way and in a way that supported the policies
      that the president of the opposite party in an election year has been demanding. It would’ve been a
      really great time for, in principle, in an ordinary time for the President of the United States to
      get up with the speaker and do a joint press conference and talk about, and show some unity behind
      this policy. And I don’t know that Johnson would’ve wanted to do that. I don’t know if that would’ve
      helped him or what would’ve helped Biden. I understand all the complexities here, but there was an
      opportunity there. Johnson kind of took it a little bit, and I think when Johnson talked about
      himself as he said he was a wartime speaker, that was remarkable, and it was remarkable—

    text: |
      That was not noticed enough. He stressed that he was a Reagan Republican and a wartime speaker. If
      you put those two things together…
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      …yeah, and he acted it. He made it happen. And he said, “I’ll lose the job rather than lose the
      issue,” and then he risked it. I haven’t heard Biden say that he’s a wartime president. In fact, I
      think Biden’s trying very hard not to be a wartime president. And I think he really… I mean, again,
      we can talk about whether it would’ve been helpful to anything or not for him to do this in the
      current state of affairs. But in principle, one would’ve liked to have seen a fairly significant
      address from him when that bill passed, as you pointed out to me when we were chatting the other day
      about this, that was an opportunity missed. And I don’t know that these things are retrievable, but
      I do think that we have to not be in the mode of saying, “Okay, phew. We got past the aid vote, now
      we can move on to other things,” because we can’t move on to other things. This remains an
      incredibly important issue, and I do think that we need to see leadership from the White House and a
      commitment to what is after all that going to be the signature foreign policy accomplishment of this
      administration if it is an accomplishment. They’ve staked the administration on it, and I have to
      give Biden credit for that, he has. His foreign policy is going to be judged very heavily by this
      war that he’s rightly been leaning into, but he’s not leading on it, and I think he really needs to,
      and I think Johnson has given both an example and a challenge, and it would be good to see the White
      House step up to that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. And both in terms, I think, of the speech and then possible speeches, but
      also deeds in terms of showing some sign of fresh thinking about, as you say, the overcoming some of
      the self-deterrence and all that. I mean, I should look up the vote again. I wrote something about
      this last week, but when Lend-Lease passed in March actually of 1941, so the election was over at
      that point, a little different. Roosevelt has been inaugurated again for a third term, but it passed
      by about the same overwhelming Democratic support, some Republican support. It wasn’t that different
      an overall margin. I’m going to assert, it was fine. It was somewhat obviously different in either
      of the House or the Senate than this bill, and that was a huge moment. Everyone understood it at the
      time to be a huge moment. He got enough bipartisan support. Roosevelt had worked pretty hard to get
      bipartisan support, bringing Knox and Stimson into the cabinet and so forth in 1940. And then
      Willkie supported it, the former Republican candidate. So we’re challenging for Biden with Trump as
      the leader of the Republican Party, no question. And then Roosevelt gives a very impressive speech
      four days afterwards on March 15th, 1941, which I came across totally by accident as I was reading
      up a little on Land-Lease, where he really lays out what’s at stake, and there’s no ambiguity.
      People say Roosevelt was very cautious and Machiavellian and leading us into World War II, and
      obviously there’s some truth to that. But this is way before, this is March of 41. This is way
      before Pearl Harbor. It’s before a lot of things. And he’s just, “We are in. I mean, we’re not in
      terms of having troops fighting obviously in Europe or in Asia, but we’re in with the allies,” and
      he explains that really to people. And I think that was, my sense is that, and many other things he
      said and did were very important in getting the American people ready for a very rough war,
      including a very rough war in Europe, at a Europe First war, not to get into the details of World
      War II strategy, which you know infinitely more about than I do, but going to war first against the
      people who hadn’t attacked us directly, think about that for a minute. People just take that for
      granted. You know what I mean? That we were going to invade Europe in 1944 and Asia where there was
      fighting going on, obviously in the islands, but we didn’t just go after the people who attacked us
      directly. Anyway, just a long way of saying that, I think Biden admires Roosevelt, and he probably
      should look back at some of what FDR did. But FDR explicitly said, “I was a New Deal president,” not
      exactly how he said it, and now, “I’m a wartime president,” that’s a little different here.
      Obviously, it’s not World War II, but a little bit of that attitude.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Well… I mean, it’s not World War II, but you can see it from here. I mean, I think that the art of
      getting through this period is not getting to World War III, and I think that this is a part of the
      problem that the administration has, that they’re also trying not to go to World War III, but their
      articulated theory of that case is we need to avoid provoking aggressors into doing things that will
      lead to World War III. And of course, that was not Roosevelt’s position, and so we’re not doing
      things, some of the things that Roosevelt did that we really should be doing like actually rearming,
      actually preparing our military seriously for the risk of future war, which we’re not doing, and
      that’s very alarming to me because I think that we have a… I think that the administration has a
      somewhat hyper-sophisticated theory about how to manage escalation and how to handle these crises
      and work our way through this period without having to be drawn away from our priorities. I don’t
      think that’s the kind of world that we’re in right now. And I think our priorities need to reflect
      the world that we’re in. And the world that we’re in is a world that’s at war and a world where much
      bigger war is very possible. And I don’t think that that war is going to be averted by careful,
      cautious escalation management at this point. I think we’re going to need to help our friends and
      allies inflict defeats on our enemies and make it clear to those enemies and to potential future
      enemies that they can’t succeed and that we’re not going to let them succeed. We’re not going to
      attack them. We don’t want to go to war with them, but we’re not going to let them defeat our
      friends and allies and partners. And so this would be a good time to stop. And so there are all
      kinds of lessons of the ’30s in here as well. We’ve passed a test, and I do think for all of our
      aggravation about what’s going on, it is important to recognize that the United States of America
      collectively walked up to the brink of what would’ve been a catastrophically bad, basically a
      national suicide pact if we had not passed this aid, if we’d cut this off, said, “We’re done here.”
      That would’ve been a national security cataclysm. And we walked up to that abyss, and we looked into
      it, and we thought hard about jumping into it. And then we decided not to. That doesn’t mean we
      won’t make a catastrophic mistake in the future, but I think it’s important for us to recognize that
      that just happened and for the world to recognize that that just happened. And now, all of those of
      us who celebrate the fact that we walked back from the abyss need to lean into helping continue the
      process of education that helped get us to do that. And that education is about understanding our
      enemies, understanding what their objectives are, and understanding what we need to do in order to
      stop them from achieving their aims now in hope and expectation of persuading them not to try to
      escalate to the point of fighting us directly in years to come. And Speaker Johnson also put this
      well. He talked about his son and he said, “I’d rather send money to Ukraine now than send my son to
      fight the Russians in the future.” That’s the option that we have right now, and we chose the right
      option this time.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think you’re right to really stress the deterrence point, which isn’t really the point that’s made
      by the 1940 or ’41 analogy. It’s more that would be an analogy, but it is a true analogy in the ’30s
      of course, that if we had done certain things much earlier and Britain had and so forth and France,
      we might have changed the course of history. And so for Ukraine, it’s 1940 or ’41 and we need to
      help them win. But for us in a certain weird way or the broader world of democracies and free
      nations and anti-dictators, it’s maybe more like mid-late ’30s. And it’s a deterrence question, not
      just a gearing up to fight question. But of course the two are very closely related since you don’t
      deter unless you gear up to fight as you just pointed out.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Yeah, absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, so he has to say, “I’m a wartime president, but I’m also a president who is deterring much
      bigger and more dangerous wars by doing what we’re doing now,” right? I guess that shouldn’t be too
      complicated a message to get to people. I don’t know.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      No. When Johnson says, “I’m a wartime Speaker,” he knows we’re not fighting. What he’s saying is the
      world is at war and the wars affect us, and we have to be a part of this effort to help our partners
      fight and win the wars that they’re fighting. And we need to do that because they’re fighting our
      common enemies. And if they’re successful, we are much less likely to have to fight. It’s a very
      straightforward argument to make actually. And we’re not hearing that argument enough from the White
      House actually.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, maybe they’ll pick it up from you. That was very well said. It’s very straightforward, but it
      takes a little thinking. But as you say, it doesn’t require huge convolutions. But let’s talk about
      that, the world at war. That isn’t, I would say, the attitude here, not just in the White House, but
      maybe even among a lot of foreign policy types. There are different wars going on. People are
      alarmed. They don’t think it’s back to 20 years ago. They’re not foolish in that way or 10 years
      ago, whatever, I don’t think. But they still don’t quite see. I’m curious what you have to say about
      both Europe in particular, which has been right there, and which on the one hand gets criticized by
      Americans, on the other hand, it’s praised by some Americans. And then we can get maybe to the
      broader question of what does it need to say. And I think you said it very well that it’s a world at
      war. But maybe Europe first would be useful.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      The debate and delay in the provision of U.S. aid has really gotten a lot of Europeans to get
      religion and to understand that they really need to think about what the world looks like without
      America. I think you can go too far in drawing this out because they looked at what the world might
      look like without America, but no one was giving up on America actually coming through, and we
      ultimately did, which was important. And I think that that’s important in a couple of ways because I
      don’t know what the European commitment would have continued to look like if we actually had decided
      that we’re done here.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      And I think it’s important not to just make a straight-line extrapolation of where they would’ve
      gone if we had made a catastrophically bad decision.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Or where they will go if they think we’re going to make that decision after November 5th. I think a
      little bit of alarm is healthy, but if America gives up, I don’t know if they really can step fully
      step up, right?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Well, they can’t step up right now. I’m sorry. They are stepping up. They can’t offset an American
      retreat fully now, but we are seeing a lot of initiatives that I would never have expected to see in
      principle. We are seeing Europeans digging through their own arsenals to get weapons to Ukraine,
      spending their own money to get weapons to Ukraine. We’re beating up on the Europeans about their
      defense budgets. They do need to increase their defense budgets. I would note parenthetically that
      all of the states that actually border the Russian sphere are spending more than 2% of GDP on
      defense. So, if anyone is going to take the position that we’re only going to defend NATO countries
      that are spending more than 2% of GDP, then that actually covers all the countries that would
      actually be attacked. But the Germans are increasing their defense budget, the French are spending,
      the British are talking about what they’re going to do and getting a bit more serious about that.
      But beyond that, they’re spending money on weapons for Ukraine. And I think as we talk about
      spending money on defense budgets, we need to factor in the expenditures on weapons provisions to
      Ukraine. It’s not the same per se as building up their own militaries, but it is building up their
      defense industrial bases. And this is a very important thing. We all have allowed our defense
      industrial bases to atrophy, and this goes back to the ’90s and the peace dividends where it was US
      policy to try to get our defense contractors to merge and to downsize because it was peace dividend.
      At the time, I thought that was a bad idea, and I’ve thought it was a bad idea ever since because we
      need to have the capability to surge, which we don’t now have. And we see that across the board with
      all of the systems that the Ukrainians are using rapidly. The Europeans similarly allowed their
      defense industrial bases to atrophy and weaken, but now they’re building them up again. And just as
      the package that the Congress just passed is a massive stimulant to the American defense industrial
      base, since well over half of that money goes to US defense industry. So the aid packages to Ukraine
      are also stimulants to the European defense industrial base. And we’re seeing combinations of the
      European defense majors like Rheinmetall investing in lines and making acquisitions and positioning
      themselves to be able to support and sustain Ukraine over the long term. We’re also seeing smaller
      companies and new joint ventures, including with Ukraine emerge. Ukrainian companies are doing joint
      ventures with European companies to create a defense industrial base that will be able to sustain
      Ukraine at a much higher level over the long term. That’s very important because as you look at what
      is the off ramp for US support to Ukraine, this is part of the off ramp. Part of the way that we get
      to a point where Ukraine continues to get what it needs and the American taxpayer doesn’t have to
      shell out tens of billions of dollars every year, is that we get the European defense industrial
      base mobilized, and we get the Europeans serious about paying for helping Ukraine, and that process
      is underway. So the urgency of the aid is because only the US has enough stocks and enough capacity
      right now to deal with the immediate emergency. That’ll be true next year as well. But if current
      trends continue, in out years, we should start to see the Europeans and the Ukrainians themselves
      able to provide a much higher proportion of what Ukraine actually needs to defend itself
      independently of the United States, which would be good for everybody. And that is a positive
      development that we’ve been seeing, and that is a result of the Europeans realizing that they are
      really at threat and it’s much better for them for the Ukrainians to hold the threat where it is
      than to look at the alternatives. And Europeans are changing their policy. Are they doing enough?
      No. Germans are still Germans. We’re still making various different decisions. We have rising right-
      wing nationalist populist parties across Europe, in many cases, not rising entirely coincidentally,
      and in some cases having some assistance from those who would benefit from having them in power, but
      in many cases, just tapping the same sort of nationalist extremist roots that are happening here and
      elsewhere. That’s a threat. That could derail this kind of activity. And then of course, Europeans
      will have to make the hard decisions about what sacrifices they’re willing to make with their
      welfare states and their social safety nets and various other things in order to turn fully around.
      I don’t expect that to happen instantly, but it’s happening a lot faster than I would’ve thought.
      And so I think there’s a lot of hope for optimism there. And of course, just stretching Europe out
      of shape, our Asian allies also get this. So the South Koreans have been leaning into thinking about
      how within the parameters of their constitution they can help, the Japanese have been leaning into
      thinking about how within the parameters of their constitution they can help, the Taiwanese have
      been thinking about that, the Australians have been thinking about… The Australians have been
      sending money and weapons. The free world generally has come to understand that this war is a
      pivotal conflict, and that the free world really needs to win. And so the free world has been
      stepping up, and I think there’s grounds for optimism there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I think that’s really well said and interesting. I’ve been struck… a year ago when I was in
      Europe a few times, I tried to make the argument that, look, think ahead. Ukraine could be an
      important partner in preserving the peace. It’s not just that we’re helping a poor country that’s
      suffering terribly from a totally unjust aggression against it, and they need our help. That’s true
      and was true and is true, and they are suffering a ton, but they’re a big country and they’re an
      impressive country as we’ve seen. And I kind of feel like in the Europeans I’ve spoken with, that’s
      beginning to penetrate, partly just with the Ukrainians are producing a lot of stuff and turned out
      to be ahead of their, quote, more advanced European partners and adapting to certain things and
      producing certain things. But yeah, we’re still only part way, and coming to grips with that aspect
      of the world that we’re living in to think of Ukraine that way, not as a little country that we’re
      helping out. It’s not Kuwait against Saddam or Iraq or something like that.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      No, that’s a really important point, Bill. If you picture a successful outcome to this war, and I’m
      going to, for purposes of the discussion, define successful as the Ukraine has some of its territory
      back, but not all of its territory back. The Russians have accepted that they can’t win and
      therefore have effectively accepted that they’ve been defeated, and we have a strong independent
      Western-aligned Ukraine that isn’t a member of NATO, but that both NATO understands is an important
      partner in Ukraine, will always look to NATO as an essential partner, any Western-oriented Ukraine
      will, regardless of its membership status. What do you have then? The largest and most powerful army
      in Europe after Russia’s will be Ukraine’s. And that army will be a danger to any future Russian
      military project. And this is one of the things that we’ve looked at with the ISW team. We looked at
      the scenarios for a Russian invasion of the Baltics if Ukraine is successful or if Russia wins the
      war. And if Russia wins the war, it’s very hard for me to see how we defend the Baltics. If Ukraine
      is successful, I would not want to be the Russian planner who has to think about how to attack the
      Baltics with the second-largest army in Europe right in his rear. Ukraine won’t be a member of the
      Alliance. If I were with the Russians, I would not be comfortable assuming that the Ukrainians would
      watch. This is a potentially very powerful check on any future Russian aggression, would be a
      strong, independent Western-oriented Ukraine. It is worth investing in because it significantly
      increases the likelihood that we will be able to deter a future Russian attack, not just for all of
      the moral sort of Russians-understanding-how-tough-we-are reasons, but for hard, practical, military
      reality reasons of how much the Russians would have to allocate defending against a possible
      Ukrainian attack in support of NATO if the Russians attack NATO.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s really interesting. And it sounds like you don’t think that the actual admission of Ukraine
      to the Alliance is crucially important. De facto can be, as it were, part of it without being
      officially the 30-whatever member, 33rd member or whatever it would be.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Look, I think your point about Ukraine is not a small country, and it needn’t be a ward of the West.
      It can be an active, major contributor to Western security means that I am not satisfied with the
      notion that the long-term solution to Ukraine is to bring it into NATO so that Article 5 can protect
      it. If we brought Ukraine into NATO, the reason to do that would be so that Ukraine can protect
      against the likelihood of a test of Article 5 by deterring a Russian enthusiasm for adventure. I
      think Ukraine can do that without being a member of the alliance. I also think that bilateral
      security guarantees with the major European partners, probably good enough, apart from NATO
      membership. I would love to see Ukraine become part of the alliance. It’s hard for me to see that
      happening as long as Orban is running Hungary, or Erdogan is running Turkey, other factors. But
      there’s a whole other conversation we can have some time about the fetishizing of Article 5 that
      we’ve got going on here. Article 5 isn’t a magical veil. Article 5 is as strong as the Russians
      think our commitment to do anything about it actually is. Helping Ukraine win the war would be a
      strong statement that would make Article 5 stronger, whether Ukraine has anything to do with the
      alliance or not.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And the opposite.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I totally agree with you. I’ve been, of course, pro-NATO in that respect, but want to stress
      the importance of Article 5 and not let people just denigrate it or throw it out because someone’s
      not spending 2%, someone’s spending 1.9% of GDP on defense or something like that. On the other
      hand, I agree the fetishizing of it has become… It’s almost like a magic thing that… The key isn’t
      the magic, the key is doing what’s needed to actually deter. And to actually win first and then to
      actually deter, I guess, and in the actual war that’s happening, a very large war, incidentally. I
      do feel like one thing, and this will get us maybe to I think what should be our final topic, which
      is the World War global character of this thing, but I feel like the argument that you argued very
      strongly against in previous conversations and elsewhere that we have to pull back from Europe so we
      could be serious about confronting China. I feel like that argument’s not gone very well for them
      for the last year or so. First of all, the Asians… None of our Asian allies believe that Japan and
      Taiwan and so forth. And secondly, it just seems at some point ridiculous to say, “Well, we just
      lose the massive war that’s happening in a place where we’ve planned for it to happen and where we
      have weapons systems that were literally built to deal with the situation.” What were our tanks
      built for? Probably for a ground war in Europe, right? But if we don’t do any of that, we’re going
      to be great fighting some war against China, I don’t know, without these tanks incidentally, I
      assume. And with other things, I’m all for built up in Asia too, obviously, and we’re doing some of
      that… But so I just want to use that as A, do you agree, but also as a transition to sort of
      thinking about how much do you think people are thinking about how should they think about the
      global character of the world at war that we’re facing?
  - speaker: Fred Kagan
    text: |
      Well, look, on the narrow argument, yes, an argument against aid to Ukraine was that somehow we need
      to keep our powder dry and be ready to fight the war with China, and therefore we should be prepared
      to give up on Europe. We argued those on our side, argued that on the contrary, if you want to deter
      China, helping Ukraine defeat Russia is the best way to do that. Conversely, allowing Russia to win
      encourages Xi to attack. I would say our argument prevailed, and more people were swayed by the
      logic of what we had to say than by that logic of those who were saying that we should abandon
      Europe. Myself, it’s always been straightforward, because it’s not just Europe or Asia, it’s…
      Dropping aid to Ukraine in order to be ready to fight China is saying, “We’re not prepared to spend
      money to fight Russia, but we’re prepared to spend blood to fight China.” Because no one imagines
      seriously that Taiwan defends itself without US forces involved. And so there’s an asymmetry in the
      test of will, money versus blood. And then there’s a whole bunch of other additional complexities,
      including the fact that Ukraine is actually a sovereign legitimate state the United States has a
      treaty with. We don’t even recognize Taiwan as an independent state. That doesn’t denigrate Taiwan’s
      independence and sovereignty in any way, but it’s an interesting position to take. So, that argument
      happily failed. I’ll see if it’s revived. It is being revived again a little bit. I actually saw a
      headline bizarrely saying this aid package ignores the China threat. So the amazing thing about this
      aid package, by the way, is that it doesn’t ignore the China threat. It sends billions of dollars to
      Taiwan and it also encompasses the TikTok ban, both of which are massive defeats inflicted on China,
      almost en passant , with almost virtually no discussion or debate or argumentation. If I were Xi
      Jinping, I would be pretty unhappy about that. But the aid package actually does address the China
      threat directly as well as indirectly, and I think that that’s also important. And it’s important
      because we are actually now facing a global entente of anti-American states, and that is: Russia,
      Iran, North Korea and China. Where Russia, Iran and North Korea are actively supporting one another
      with military equipment and military technology, sharing lessons from the Russia war. North Koreans
      have provided upwards of 3,000,000 artillery rounds to the Russians as well as rockets and missiles
      that the Russians are using. The Iranians of course, have provided the Shahed drones. And the
      Iranians are benefiting in turn from watching how the Russian drone and missile packages operate
      against Western systems. One of the things we argued at ISW and CTP was that the Iranian attack on
      Israel mirrored some of the Russian drone and missile packages that they fired at Ukraine, which
      looks very much like the Iranians. And we know that there are some Iranians with the Russian forces
      watching how they’re doing this are trying to learn and adapt the lessons that the Russians are
      learning. The IRGC-controlled media is now claiming that the Iranians have a version of the Russian
      Lancet drone, which is a loitering munition. But we’ve seen the Iranians claim that they have
      weapons that they don’t actually have before, so I’ll believe it when I see it actually work. But it
      would be an interesting concrete example of the Iranians actually gaining that kind of capability.
      We don’t know exactly what the Russians are giving the North Koreans other than cover by vetoing the
      renewal of the North Korean sanctions monitoring program at the United Nations, which is a big deal,
      and a major Russian break on that issue. I think it’s very likely that the Russians are providing
      missile technology and know-how to the North Koreans, which is very alarming since the North
      Koreans, among other things, are trying to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that can hit
      us and do various other things. The Russians are certainly giving them cash, which is a big deal.
      And I think the Russians are giving them food and other supplies. These relationships are growing.
      And the ISW and CTP both just reported out on a real intensive flurry of public discussions between
      Russian, Iranian, North Korean and Chinese officials leading up to an event in St. Petersburg where
      they were all present, but which has continued subsequently. This is an entente that is really
      coming together in a way that should alarm us quite a lot. These countries disagree about a lot of
      things. They don’t share a common ideology, but they do share a common enemy: us. And the thing that
      they agree on is that we are a major obstacle to their objectives and their plans, and therefore
      that it’s in each of their interests to help the others take us down. That’s something that we
      haven’t really seen in a long time, certainly not meaningfully since we managed to split China from
      the Soviet Union. And it is beginning to look like the World War II Axis in ways that we could start
      to see similar kinds of behavior. In some respects, it’s more integrated than the Axis ever was
      because the Germans and the Japanese really were not exchanging a whole lot of military technology
      and weren’t doing much other than to both hating us. These guys are really working together, and
      that should alarm us quite a lot. And I think this is another reason to understand why what happens
      in each one of these theaters affects this entire entente. So I’ve made this argument in a piece
      where I said, “You can’t be an Iran hawk and a Russia dove,” and you can’t because Putin winning in
      Ukraine will strengthen Iran and will strengthen North Korea very directly, and not abstractly.
      Conversely, you can’t be a Russia hawk and an Iran dove because the Iranians benefit and grow
      stronger and have more capability, the Russians will benefit too. And you can’t be a North Korea
      hawk and a Russia or Iran dove either. We have to recognize that this is an entente that aims to
      take us down, and we have to be resisting every part of it. That’s the world that we’re living in.

      And I’m struck by your emphasis on, we can close with this, on the practical coordination among
      them. Someone like me, I don’t really no one enough to judge that stuff, and so it’s interesting
      sort as a intellectual and almost ideological matter you might say, to say, “They’re working closely
      together. It’s a different kind of world than we thought 10 or 20 years ago.” I think that’s true,
      and I don’t think the meetings and the speeches and the votes at the UN and so forth are meaningless
      either, but I am struck by your emphasis and to maybe just say a word more about that just on how
      practically important it is. Certainly when you read stuff about the war in Ukraine, it seems like
      the Iranian stuff is been pretty important. And I don’t know how many, 3,000,000 artillery shells, I
      don’t know if that’s a lot or a little. It sounds like a lot to me. So you can mock North Korea all
      you want as kind of this third world horrible backward place, but that’s 3,000,000 more than we were
      living there for a while, right?

      Oh my God, yeah. No, look, 3,000,000 shells is a lot. 3,000,000 shells is maybe half of what the
      Russians would like to use in a year.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Wow.
  - speaker: Fred Kagan

      No, it’s a lot of shells. North Korea is… Look, I used to say truthfully that from Putin’s
      perspective, it should be a warning sign that things are not going well for you when you have to go
      and ask for the help of a country whose GDP rounds to zero. But look, the one thing the North
      Koreans do have is tons and tons and tons of stockpiles of artillery shells because that was their
      strategy for how they’re going to deal with the South, is they’re just going to shell Seoul into
      oblivion. And they have been giving the Russians older shells, and that’s been an issue for the
      Russians, which I’ve been enjoying watching the shells not perform and that kind of stuff, but
      there’s still a lot of them. The Shaheds make a huge difference because the Russians use the Shaheds
      in a very sophisticated fashion. They don’t just use them as attack drones, because the Shahed is a
      fixed wing long range drone, and you can put sensors on it too, and they do. So the Russians also
      use the Shaheds as scouts. On the way to their final targets, they return a lot of information to
      the Russians since the Russians use them to conduct reconnaissance, do a whole bunch of things,
      which is why as they integrate them with the missile packages using Shaheds makes the missile
      packages more effective as well. And so the Iranians have given the Russians, I don’t know, hundreds
      or thousands of these. And then the Iranians have helped the Russians build a factory to produce
      thousands of these in Russia itself. And these weapons make a big difference. But beyond that,
      here’s a thing that… You probably know this, a lot of your listeners may not be aware of this. The
      Russians have a major manpower shortage. So this is not the Soviet Union and Putin hasn’t mobilized
      it the way that the Soviets mobilized in World War II, and he doesn’t want to. So the Russians
      report that they have about a 5,000,000 person shortage in their labor pool. And at the same time,
      he’s mobilizing hundreds of thousands of guys to go fight and taking casualties in the hundreds of
      thousands in Ukraine. Putin faces a one-to-one choice between having young men fight or having them
      work in the factories, and he doesn’t have enough young men to do both. What he’s trying to do is to
      use Iranian and North Korean, and to the extent that he can get the Chinese to do it, this Chinese
      labor, to offset his own manpower shortages so that he doesn’t have to go to higher levels of
      mobilization and he doesn’t have to make these very hard choices that he’s trying to avoid making.
      That should alarm us, because what does that actually mean concretely? It means that the Russians
      are looking to North Korea and Iran to do for them what we’re doing for Ukraine, which is to sort of
      mobilize their defense industry on the behalf of the Russians. But at the end of that, I’m happy
      that European defense industry is mobilized because that helps us. I’m unhappy the extent to which
      this war has the Russians helping the Iranians and the North Koreans mobilize their defense
      industries because that will then give them a capability that they can then turn against us as well.
      So there’s a lot of very concrete stuff going on. And I’m glad that you brought this up because, no,
      this isn’t just a principled Hitler encouraging the Japanese and the Japanese encouraging Hitler,
      and, “We all hate the West together.” No, this is a very concrete program of, in some cases,
      interoperable military activity. Because the Russians have been fighting in an interoperable
      military coalition with the Iranians since 2015. It’s been a decade that the Russians have been in
      Syria fighting alongside the Iranians and their proxies. There’s nothing abstract about this. This
      is a very real entente. I’m calling it entente because there’s no formal agreements in the non-
      alliance system here, so it’s an understanding, it’s an entente. But it’s very real, it’s very
      practical and it’s very alarming. And it’s something that really should cause us to take a
      fundamental re-look at the world today, where we think the world is going, and what we think the
      United States is going to need to do to defend ourselves and our lives in the future.

      That’s so important. Well, that’s a good note to end on. And we’ll have to come back and take that
      more of that re-look in a few months. And we know more about what’s happening, obviously on the
      battlefield as well. But Fred, this has really been very enlightening, both as an update and thought
      provoking about the future. And so I really want to thank you for joining me again. And we’ll have
      to do it again soon, I hope with maybe better news at the late in 2024. That would be very nice if
      they’ve turned the corner, so to speak. But Fred Kagan, thank you very much.
