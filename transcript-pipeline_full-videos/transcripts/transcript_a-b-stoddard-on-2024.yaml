      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined today by A.B.
      Stoddard, with whom I had an excellent conversation about 10 months ago. And we’re going to pick up
      on some of those themes today. A.B. has had a distinguished career as both a reporter and a
      commentator. You can find her work at RealClearPolitics and occasionally, it should be even a little
      more occasionally at The Bulwark , with some really excellent pieces there. And I think really one
      of A.B’s great virtues is that she’s both a serious reporter, a real reporter, does interviews, has
      sources, and a very thoughtful commentator. And most people are sort of one or the other, but A.B.
      is both. So, A.B, thanks for joining me again.

      Thanks for having me again, Bill. It’s an honor and a pleasure.

      Well, it’s great. The previous conversation, which was in July, 2022 stands up well, and we
      discussed Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, and Congress. And let’s just go through those three topics
      today and see what’s changed and what we have to say since July, but also since the election. So,
      Donald Trump, the Republican Party, you’ve been a consistent skeptic that the Republican Party could
      liberate itself from Trump. I think it’s fair to say and including when other people thought that
      was quite likely. Where do you think we stand on Trump in 2024 and Trump and the Republicans?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Well, Bill, I mean, as of this time, he is clearly the almost presumed nominee; it’s going to be a
      big mountain to climb for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to try to overcome him. A morning consult
      poll I saw today has his lead against over DeSantis now biggest ever at 43 points.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This is May, what is this? Just to be clear, this is mid-May, May 16th, just so when people look
      back a year and a half from now, they can give you credit for being way ahead of the curve here in
      May.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard

      Or will be able to say, isn’t it great that Ron DeSantis came out of his terrified corner and took
      Trump on and took him down, and that would be a great thing. But anyway, at this rate, it just seems
      that Trump is impenetrable, that his support has grown as his legal exposure has increased, and that
      the contenders around him, like DeSantis, cannot find a way to go after him. And unless they go
      after him, they can’t beat him, and they can’t take him out. So all of this pain and duress about
      not poking the base is really proving fruitless. They haven’t come up with a response. They haven’t
      found their secret weapon, their solution. They’re laying their path, their way of distinguishing
      themselves from Trump, showing the base that he’s truly vulnerable in a general election and that
      it’s time to move on. No one will even call him a lame duck. I mean, imagine that’s not hard to do.
      “Hey, with Trump, you only get four years.” I mean, they won’t say anything about this guy. And so
      he had a great town hall for him, I think, at CNN, and he’s just steamrolling his way. Many things
      intervene, of course, Bill, but right now his firm grip on the party is as powerful if not more
      powerful than ever because, what’s the goal? To get away with as much as he can. It’s to get away
      with things. And he’s gotten away with January 6th, and the plotting of a coup. He’s gotten away
      with being found potentially… first, he stole documents, classified documents from the White House,
      but potentially he obstructed justice and caused his lawyers to lie and everything. The more this
      builds, the more intense the support. And the establishment and the elites, who are not in the 2024
      field but are connected to the donors in this deep sense of fear about Donald Trump being their
      nominee, are still powerless in the face of his strength.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Okay, well, there’s a lot there. So let’s unpack that a little. I mean, A, do you take it that
      DeSantis is close to being the only alternative to Trump? That, I mean, it’s sort of 90% that it’s
      one of the two of them, 95%… I mean, you think it is? Do you think no one’s going to come from 4%
      and have a dramatic run and upset both of the people ahead of them, ahead of that person?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      This is an amazing thing that you look at the same polls I do that Pence and Haley are always number
      three and four, which is stunning to me. I understand the appeal of Nikki Haley. A very solid
      resume, a non-white woman, that’s exciting to a lot of Republicans. Mike Pence consistently holds at
      third place, usually over her. Right now, I think in the morning consult poll, he’s at 6%. He is
      now, as of today, going to launch. Allies are launching a PAC in favor as he considers an
      exploratory committee. And we’ve talked about this before. We don’t see his constituency, we don’t
      see his path, but he is refusing to engage in the culture wars. His allies say if he runs, this
      likely campaign will be issues-centric. Nikki Haley, again, she’ll say a few things here and there
      on Twitter, but she really tries to be policy-based. She tries to retreat from the culture war. Tim
      Scott— not running on the culture war. So if Chris Sununu and Chris Christie get in, I doubt that
      they will be running on culture wars. But Ron DeSantis is all in on culture wars, and he obviously
      has a solid resume of accomplishments he could be running on. I mean, he does, but he also just
      wants to be sort of second MAGA king in line, and he has the most appeal. So the others have to test
      the theory that the Republican primary electorate wants to move past the culture wars. And I don’t
      think they do. And that’s why it seems that Ron DeSantis would be the only fallback for the base.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It is striking, you’d think there’d be a lane… I mean, once they sort out who’s the third man or
      woman in this race, there’s some lane for a non-culture war, somewhat more attractive to
      independents, perhaps Republican. But I guess that lane is probably 20% of the Republican
      electorate, not 40, right? And so it doesn’t actually win. So maybe DeSantis was right to sort of
      show he’s a culture warrior, even though, from my point of view, it’s a little crazy—if you’re a
      pretty successful governor of a major state who won reelection by 19 points—never to talk about
      that. Almost never to talk about that. And to talk entirely about Disney and so forth, but we’ll
      talk about DeSantis, I guess, and sort of what you’ve learned about him as a presidential candidate
      so far.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Well, we all know, and this so well, Bill, that the idea of running for president when everyone
      tells you that you have to do it, that you’re the hope of the party is very tantalizing. Again, he
      comes off this amazing 19-point victory, reelection victory in which he won independents and
      Democrats just a resounding stunning win. And people are telling him he’s the next hope of the
      Republican Party, and he has to come in and save the Republicans from Trump. And the idea with his
      wife’s great encouragement, we reportedly know, of doing this is so different than doing it. And
      he’s not even officially a candidate yet. But the guy looks so panicked. Now, obviously, as I said
      from the start, has not found a way to criticize Trump and separate himself from Trump. But even
      when he is standing at these podiums, they always have him in with big posters in front of the
      podium and people around him flanking him, and he has a new thing he’s mad at that day… The Chinese
      buying property, the Disney corporation, the teacher, the groomer teachers, whatever it is that he’s
      going after. And he’s going to have a new bill in the legislature to end this once and for all. He
      looks miserable. He always looks like he’s counting the seconds until he can leave. And, of course,
      there was that… he took a recent trip overseas, and he was in Japan. He was supposed to look like a
      statesman on a world stage. And someone just said, “You’re way behind,” a reporter said, “You’re way
      behind Trump in the polls.” And this video went around that looked like it was doctored, he looked
      so almost like he was on a very strong drug. So the guy has not figured out a sense of comfort with
      himself as a candidate, a sense of confidence. He feels like he should do it, he’s being put up to
      it. He has all the boxes checked. And he also has a really impressive story in addition to his
      tenure as governor, but he’s not feeling it. And so I think that the people around him are really
      concerned. And I was in touch with, again just in the last week with a DeSantis supporter…fluffer.
      And they’re really trying to, because we’re about to be at liftoff, it’s likely he’s going to be
      announcing in about 10 days, likely next weekend around May 25th or so. And he’s gathering people to
      Florida. And so that’s what they’re anticipating. And they’ve been in these kind of emergency
      meetings. It was very telling that the brain trust invited Jonathan Martin of Politico down to talk
      to them because they don’t speak to the mainstream media ever. But the disappointment and the doubt
      among the donors was so intense, and people were leaving, that they had to reset before this
      announcement and try to rebuild some momentum. I guess the best place to be is when everyone has
      literally no expectation that you can pull this off. But he’s been in sort of crash repair mode and
      trying to convince these people he can do it. But we haven’t seen it yet. We just haven’t seen Ron
      DeSantis in an interview. Ron DeSantis doing his job, looking like he knows his why and he knows his
      how of taking on Donald Trump. And so I think I’ll believe it, Bill, when I see it, if he really has
      what it takes. But so far, you could always look good on paper, but when you get out under the
      light, it’s so tough.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, it’s so different. I mean, I do think there’s, of course, a very short term price we paid, and
      you do reset, and you have a little bit of panic and meetings and so forth, and you get a little hit
      in the media for a few days. But actually, there have been successful presidential campaigns,
      certainly nomination campaigns that had pretty conspicuously bad starts and needed to reset. Gore in
      2000. Kerry actually in 2004. I mean, there’s cases where people just… neither won the presidency,
      but that’s sort of different. But Obama was viewed as sort of floundering a little bit in the first
      few months after he… was he really ready in 2007? So I do think McCain totally crashed and burned in
      2007. So in a way, I’ve always thought resetting is better than not resetting, even if the reset is
      awkward And I guess the question though is reset to what, right? And you identified 10 months ago,
      the problem with running as, I’m better than Trump, but I’m not going to criticize Trump. Trump’s
      being unjustly persecuted. Trump was a very excellent president, but you need me. Why exactly? Well,
      because I’m younger maybe, but Trump looks pretty vigorous. I can win. But Trump’s kind of even with
      Biden in the polls. I mean, Jonathan Last, our friend and the editor of The Bulwark , has made this
      point many, many times. It’s hard to run against someone when you don’t make the case why you would
      be a better president than that person. And then it becomes electability or fresh face, but that’s a
      little tenuous. I don’t know. What do you think? I guess that would bad question. Does he have to
      take on Trump, or could events, indictments, for example, wound Trump enough that DeSantis can be
      sort of, “I’m not Trump, but I’m not taking on Trump?”
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right. So, first of all, I totally agree with you about early stumbles can really help the
      maturation of a presidential campaign and candidate. And the reset can turn the whole ship around. I
      think in the case of Ron DeSantis, because he just basically also doesn’t seem to have much
      personality, if you combine the fact that he has the too-tight-shoe look on his face and doesn’t
      really love hanging around with people, which John McCain ultimately did. I mean, once you got him
      into the diner or into the town hall, even if he was grumpy on the way out to the car, he really
      liked talking with people. So if you combine that with the fact that he hasn’t figured out his way
      to defeat Trump. When you run, this is the most surreal presidential primary where you have everyone
      saying, “Oh, he is the best president we’ve ever had. But I don’t know, I guess I’m in this primary
      in case he has a heart attack or gets indicted.” I mean, the indictments, first of all, I don’t
      think he’ll be prosecuted before election day. And I don’t think there’s a jury that would convict
      him in this country. Because I think there always will be an outlier among the jurors. And then I
      just think Ron DeSantis, we’ve seen him in a jam after the Stormy Daniels…. I mean, he tries to “on
      the one hand, and on the other hand” it, but they’re terrified of infuriating the base. And so it’s
      just this idea that he’s both nervous in the lane and then he sort of has no destination. He doesn’t
      have that plan like Chris Christie’s articulated, which is, you have to literally take this guy on.
      You have to say, you only get four more years. He’s tired with baggage. The legal peril is serious.
      Some of it’s actually going to be serious, and he’s going to lose women and he’s going to, whatever
      case you want to make. He’s too afraid to make it. And so that’s why I just think, until and unless
      we see that they have found a place for him to land where they think that they can keep all of the
      Republicans, win all the Republicans who want to move on from Trump. And that’s a pretty big amount.
      And then bring the voters after a few more headlines who were telling Sarah’s focus groups a while
      ago, ah, I’m worried about him winning. I’m worried about the baggage. So maybe a few more polls
      that are good for Biden. This is entirely possible. And as you know, Bill, I hope this happens, and
      I hope that Ron DeSantis is the nominee and not Trump, because I think the threat of Trump is so
      dangerous. But all that has to happen. He has to find some comfort, some actual physical comfort in
      the role of being on that stage and under those lights and pressure of those questions. And he has
      to then have the confidence that he can beat Trump. And this is why he needs to. You have to tell
      the voters, he has to be beaten, and this is why. This is why I do it. And if you can’t articulate
      that, you don’t often do it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, I think that’s well said. And that’s such an important point. And Trump does look cheerful in
      his own way and at home, comfortable, certainly on the stage. I mean, that was, for me, the take. I
      was traveling during the CNN Town Hall, and I’m curious to get your thoughts on that, very curious.
      But I mean, what struck me from a distance watching some clips is Trump is good at this and Trump
      has done it a zillion times. He’s better. He’s older, but I’d say he is better at it actually than
      he was in 2015-16, or maybe even 2020 a little more. It was such an easy one, that town hall. But if
      you’re an incumbent, 2015-16, he hadn’t run for president before 2020. He wasn’t incumbent, which
      meant he couldn’t simply not, he did sort of have to defend certain things he had done in office,
      which is a little awkward. Now he can just] be as demagogic as he wants, but also on other issues,
      not be quite as right wing as DeSantis, let’s say on abortion or something like that, or not pick
      really ridiculous fights with Disney. Because the base is so attached to him that they’ll forgive a
      little bit of heterodoxy. So I guess what I’m struck by, and I want you to talk about this, but he’s
      just a better demagogue as of now than DeSantis. Demagogues have to sort of look like they believe
      what they’re saying. And in America, I think they have to look like they enjoy what they’re saying.
      Not just demagogues, but politicians. McCain, Obama, Bush. We tend to nominate somewhat cheerful
      people. And Trump, in his own kind of bizarre way, is somewhat cheerful, but also he’s a mainstream
      demagogue. I mean, what’s wrong with Biden? He’s going to start World War III because God knows what
      he’s doing in foreign policy. I’m tough, so they won’t mess with me, and he doesn’t really
      understand the economy. And I’m a businessman, and we had a decent economy when I was president, so
      I understand the economy. So that’s not actually that ideological. I mean, it’s sort of substance-
      less, but if you’re a middle-class business person who doesn’t really like Trump and sort of worried
      about him, you hear that and you think, yeah, that’s a reasonable appeal. And, meanwhile, DeSantis
      is talking about Disney. I really think Trump is in a better demagogic lane than DeSantis as of now.
      So anyway, comment on all that.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      I do agree, talking about inflation and not starting World War III is enough of a message alone.
      It’s actually true. And you can say the border’s chaotic, which actually, interestingly enough, this
      week it turns out that it’s sort of not after the end of Title 42, but that could change.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It will be at some point.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right. And so if he sticks to a simple message that’s not all about what he calls “gender insanity.”
      A few months ago, he was so worried about Ron DeSantis, he was trying to run to the right on him on
      education. He seems so confident now he’s not doing that anymore, but if he will—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      There’s been a mention of some, which is good for his days, probably. Yeah.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      But putting out the scary videos and stuff, he feels like now he should retreat to that and speak to
      the general electorate. In the CNN in town hall, he was having an absolute blast because he’s a
      showman, and as Mike Murphy tweeted, “It was open mic night for him.” So once he realized they were
      laughing and applauding, he called everybody stupid. And he was really relishing, just letting it
      all hang out. And he knew that they were easy laughs. So he was really on fire. But it is true that
      he also knows, like you said, Bill, I think when to pull back, and DeSantis’ Disney thing now looks
      like this kind of weird fetish where people are wondering, what’s wrong with you? Can you just move
      on to something else? So it’s weird. DeSantis could just be talking about lockdowns, and he could
      even be talking about vaccines to try to jam Trump. But instead, he wants to talk about all these
      bills that they’re going to do in Florida to stop this and that, and only talking about Trump’s
      record. So it’s easy for Trump, I think, as you said, to just have a couple of things he hits over
      and over. But what struck me about the CNN Town Hall was that his lies, they were coming so fast and
      he wasn’t the least bit sheepish about them. And it’s a tool for dominance. We’ve watched him now,
      it’s my eighth year of watching this up close, and it definitely has changed. He lies more and more
      loudly and more rapidly in a setting like that. And he is the president, and he creates his own
      reality. And if you want to try to drop in there and correct him, you’re just like a gnat on the
      windshield. You’re just going to get run over and ‘see ya.’ So it was both a great night for him and
      it was truly terrifying, I thought.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I mean, that’s so well said. Because when you read up on authoritarians in the past and on con
      men, two categories that Trump probably fits in pretty well, they get better at it. I mean, I
      thought in 2015 I think Trump said these outrageous things and these lies, and you could tell he was
      a little uncertain like, “Can I get away with this exactly?” And I don’t know if you could tell,
      maybe I’m reading stuff in retrospectively, but he seemed a little more tentative, let’s say. And
      you’re right, now that he has gotten away with it all… And of course you’re a better liar if you’re
      totally comfortable lying, right? I mean, you’re a better conman if you have just gotten beyond any
      constraints on the con, and either the constraints of conscience of that ever existed or the
      constraints of what if they find out about this, and in that respect I think my friends, my new
      liberal friends are, “well, he can’t get away with this. This lie is even worse,” but I think they
      underestimate how many people unfortunately are willing to get swept up into this. And not just the
      true believers, but even the not quite so true believers who just find it… The open mic night is a
      great line of Mike’s, just gets swept up in it. And he wasn’t that bad last time. Then you say,
      “Well, the reason he wasn’t that bad if he wasn’t was because he had 19 different constraints, both
      individuals and institutional constraints that won’t exist in a second term,” but no one of course
      is making that argument except for Biden, none of the Republicans are, so the primaries that doesn’t
      stop people from defaulting back to Trump, do you think? I don’t know. January 6th incidentally, is
      anyone even going to mention that in the Republican primary? I guess not.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      It just makes me so sick. I wrote that for The Bulwark months ago. They’re not allowed to say that
      he didn’t win the election. Chris Sununu says that, Chris Christie says that. Mike Pence says things
      like, “I didn’t do what he wanted me to do because I didn’t have the constitutional authority to on
      January 6th,” and will always disagree, but he doesn’t like to come out and say, “We lost the
      election.” He really avoids that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But you shouldn’t incite mobs. It’s the story of the Capitol.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      But they won’t even, they will not even criticize January 6th. So not only will they not say he
      lost, they will not say he definitely tried to steal an election, he plotted a two-month coup, he
      incited a deadly a riot where people died. They won’t touch January 6th. They won’t touch his coup
      plotting. And so the message they’re sending everybody is that it’s okay. And Trump is absolutely
      giddy that he has, as you just referenced, gotten away with it. He is being rewarded for it. And in
      that audience, he was rewarded for making fun and denigrating E. Jean Carroll, his accuser. So he’s
      gotten past the Stormy Daniels indictment into a civil defamation case where he was found liable of
      sexual, they call it abuse, but they lumped that in with assault for which he owes her five million
      dollars, but people were laughing the very next day. So he’s been rewarded by the primary electorate
      and the fact that his rivals cannot bring themselves to criticize any of that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Do you think DeSantis… Two questions. He launches in 10 days or so, does he start criticizing Trump
      more directly either because he can’t win or because he wouldn’t actually be as good a president as
      he DeSantis would be? And also it seems like DeSantis’s strategy is focus on Iowa and New Hampshire,
      if you win both of those, you’re probably the nominee, if you win one of them, you have shot at
      being the nominee, and that’s how an underdog typically gets to at least parody with a front-runner,
      you win Iowa, Obama won Iowa and so forth, McCain won New Hampshire in 2000. McCain fell short,
      Obama won the nomination, but in each case that’s how they became the plausible alternative to the
      person who would seem the fairly prohibitive front-runner, Hillary Clinton or George W. Bush. So
      what do you think of the Iowa, New Hampshire strategy, and does he have to start taking on Trump?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      I think with Trump’s lead, he has to start taking on Trump, but I understand in the absence of that
      he is going to try to sell himself, I am the man of all these accomplishments, I don’t have baggage,
      I get things done, Ron delivers. That’s going to be his message once he’s a candidate. And I think
      he is really smart in this moment of reset where there’s been all this disappointment that he was
      going to rescue the party and turned out to look like he was maybe losing his nerve. I think it’s
      very shrewd that they went ahead and they got the endorsement of Steve Cortes, which he’s a huge
      Trump supporter, and it’s a pretty big deal and it makes it look like Ron has a few more tricks up
      his sleeve. So that instills some hope in the people who want to keep supporting him. And then to
      come out and unveil a whole slew of Iowa endorsements and then a whole slew of New Hampshire
      endorsements, the ones from New Hampshire yesterday totaled 51, both lists had people that the Trump
      campaign had said were endorsing them that turned out to be false information. What a surprise that
      these state legislators, Bill, had not actually endorsed Trump. They were somewhere maybe in talks
      with the DeSantis camp and they get on DeSantis’s final list of supporters and have to say, “Look, I
      don’t know why I was ever put on Trump’s list.” So, he’s trying to needle him in, but not directly.
      And so, it doesn’t look bad. It looks better than it did five days ago or a week ago. Winning New
      Hampshire and or Iowa would make a big difference, but some other stars I think have to align
      between now and then, which is Trump needs to be weighted down more. If there is a Georgia
      indictment or a Jack Smith indictment on Mar-a-Lago documents, he needs to be weighted down and
      there needs to be some serious chorus that started the other day with Senator Todd Young from
      Indiana, Senator Mike Rounds from South Carolina saying, “Wait a minute about the—”

      South Dakota.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Oh, sorry, South Dakota, about the E. Jean Carroll verdict. And if you have, that was a civil
      defamation case, on a serious indictment or maybe for obstruction of justice, if you have people
      say, “We just can’t nominate someone like this, that’s doing the work for Ron DeSantis.” So a few
      things have to align in order for him to avoid criticizing Trump. He will be asked by every reporter
      wherever he goes, maybe sometimes voters, but in the end is he going to have to criticize Trump on
      the debate stage because we don’t think that Trump’s going to show up? So it’s very hard now for me
      to see how this plays out without just damage happening to Trump because of Trump. Maybe this
      accusation that Rudy Giuliani was trying to sell pardons at two million a pop and maybe Trump was
      involved in, we don’t know, things could happen that weigh Trump down that would help Ron DeSantis,
      but I think he has to screw up the courage to say, “I am running because we need a better nominee. I
      am better for these reasons.” And I think he has to find a way to say that with strength.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, I think that’s right. For all that the Republican establishment is discredited allegedly and
      mixed blessing, I do think having a lot of these senators and governors just weigh in the way you
      just said would have some effect on those swing maybe Trump voters. Obviously, Trump will have his
      30% no matter what, but it can’t just be DeSantis saying it, but it can’t not be DeSantis saying it.
      It has to be people up to and including probably Mitch McConnell ultimately, just people who really…
      If you’re a business Republican and you respect, it has to be the chamber of commerce, it has to be
      whoever it is in different states saying, “Look, we have a better alternative here. Trump’s likely
      to lose. He’s going to govern very erratically if he gets back in.” But that is a more traditional
      message for DeSantis, and what’s weird is the DeSantis campaign seems to have seemed to have talked
      itself into, “we can’t be the establishment candidate at all. We have to be even more of a culture
      warrior than Trump.” They spend half their time, that super PAC of DeSantis’s, they’re accusing
      Trump of being like in cahoots with CNN, and I just think that’s the most ineffective… The idea that
      you’re going to beat Trump by saying he’s part of the establishment is just childish at this point.
      Trump, everyone thinks correctly, if he goes in for a second term, God knows what he’ll do. So,
      DeSantis is unwilling to embrace the fact that he’s got to be the candidate of the slightly more
      respectable Republicans than Trump and mobilize those forces, but in a way his campaign, until these
      very last few days, hasn’t really gone in that direction. I just think your point about him
      attacking Trump and distinguishing himself from Trump is so important. And you said this 10 months
      ago, if he had to get up on stage and say, “I love Donald Trump, he’s a great president, great guy,
      unjustly persecuted by the libs, but, hey, vote for me for president.” I know the guy’s been
      president four years, he won the nomination twice. He’s the only Republican to win a general
      election since 2004. It’s a little hard to say he can’t do it again or he shouldn’t do it again
      unless you say he can’t do it again or he shouldn’t do it again.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Exactly. It’s interesting though that you just said about the establishment, Ron DeSantis a few
      months ago was looking like the establishment. And Trump could have run… I think he would’ve if he
      didn’t regain his foothold, would’ve run against him as he says, “The backing of all the rhino
      sellouts, they’re coming to get me, we’re the outsiders that [inaudible]—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      He did that a little, right? He liked Jeb Bush, he liked Paul Ryan?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right. And that was because Ron DeSantis had some momentum back then. Ron DeSantis had Fox News ,
      there was a soft ban on Trump. Ron DeSantis had all the love, he had all the donor money, he was
      doing better in the polls against Trump. In the early states, he was quite competitive with Trump
      and his campaign liked to point that out. So now I don’t think that Ron DeSantis is the
      establishment, and I don’t think he has to worry about that. He can say, “Look, you’ve got your
      senators too, Tuberville and everyone else, you’re running around with all your endorsements and
      you’re a former president.” I think there’s a way where he can also paint Trump as the
      establishment, or his allies can do that. So I don’t think that he’s really in that corner anymore.
      I don’t think Ron DeSantis is running for vice president, they clearly can’t stand each other, and
      they’re both from Florida, so he has to say, “I’m in this to win this. People are begging for an
      alternative. We have to have a president who does such and such. We can’t support someone who does
      such and such.” He has to articulate that. And the most frustrating thing, Bill, about watching this
      primary, not only that they refuse to address January 6th, which is to me just such a dividing line
      in our whole American life in terms of what we expect from leaders, what we believe about our
      country, what our hopes are for the future, how we’re seen in the world, none of them will say he
      shouldn’t win. So you just said, they could say he’s going to govern erratically. Not one of them
      when they compliment Tim Scott, when they say that E. Jean Carroll verdict bothers them, they always
      say he can’t win. They never say he shouldn’t win. And I’m just waiting for one of them to tell the
      American electorate that he should not win and he should not have power again, and put it in the
      terms at least halfway as stark as Liz Cheney does when she says he cannot hold any office again,
      it’s indefensible. Not one of them will say that. I don’t expect them to go that far, but they’ve
      got to start with he can’t win and he shouldn’t win. And until that, like you said, they can come
      back with the random Rasmussen poll that they’ve got that shows that he’s always going to beat Biden
      nine out of 12 times, blah, blah, blah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Speaking of Liz Cheney, final Republican question, and get to President Biden, the Democrats, I
      don’t know, would it be better for her, would it be better for the Republican Party, such as hopes
      for a saner Republican Party would be better for the country, if she actually ran for president?
      She’ll make her up her own mind and she’s got all a million considerations obviously, but are you
      rooting for her to run or think that would be crazy and imprudent and she should do other things?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      When we talked about this last year, I was so hoping that would be a possibility because I think
      that she would really provide this course correction for the other people most importantly talking
      about January 6th for the conversation and the debate in the race, even minus Trump, even if he
      wasn’t on the debate stage. I just think the RNC is so compromised that she’ll never get on the
      debate stage. And I think that all the state parties are compromised and they’re subsidiaries of
      Trump and they won’t put her on the ballots, and it’s just a total wasted exercise. So in a normal
      world, if we could go back a few years, it would be very healthy for her to be the outlier who was
      going to try to revive the old party, but right now that’s just Asa Hutchinson because he is playing
      nice and maybe they’ll let him stand on the right far right side of the debate stage, but I don’t
      think they’d permit Liz Cheney anywhere near, I think they’d do whatever they could to make it so
      hard for her.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      All they’d have to do is say you have to pledge to support the nominee and they won’t hold Trump to
      [inaudible] but of course they would hold Liz to it.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      But they’re not going to hold Trump to it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right, of course not.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      He’s not going to pledge to support any nominee except for him.
  - speaker: Bill Crystal
    text: |
      Will he debate, do you think? What do you think?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      I don’t think he will.
  - speaker: Bill Crystal
    text: |
      Interesting.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Because it’s just a set-up for failure. He could go in and start screaming at everybody and saying
      crazy things and dominate, and he likes that, I think he enjoys the actual fight, but I think he
      knows, he’s telling people privately, I’m too far ahead, he knows that the most likely outcome is he
      loses his lead a little bit and so what’s the point? And they can all stand the stage and say he’s
      afraid and he’ll be like, “They’re afraid.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, it draws him down to their level if you’re the front-runner in your debate, whereas he’s done
      a town hall, he’s not scared of anything. This is where that CNN Town Hall let’s just do a final
      before we get to President Biden, who’s important. This is, of course, typical of the Biden years,
      you spend the first half hour of the conversation on Trump,
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But why not? He’s been the dominant figure in American politics for eight years. It’s really
      astonishing. But anyway, what was I going to say about that? The CNN Town Hall, I don’t know, maybe
      it just comes and goes, but it feels like a significant moment where he went on CNN, he did what
      they said he wouldn’t do, confronts, a tough questioner in a somewhat fake but still town hall
      setting, only with Republicans or Republican-leaning independents who two-thirds of whom were pro-
      Trump presumably, and certainly showed they were, but still, it gives him a good talking point for
      the foreseeable future about, and for voters it’s like he took them on, that’s the Trump we know.
      Look at him. He’s not scared of them.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      It most definitely energized his supporters just so much. And that’s probably what led to the bump
      in the Morning Consult poll, the new one. And I think that a lot of Republicans who want to move
      beyond him, like Mark Thiessen at The Post and stuff are saying, “that was a Biden commercial.” I
      don’t think it was. And to your point, Biden wants us to keep talking about Trump because he thinks
      it’s better when we talk about Trump than when we talk about him. But I don’t, and I think the White
      House was trying to say… that they too were trying to say it was a Biden commercial, but I’m not so
      sure. So, I think that ubiquity is power, Trump’s always known that, at least it is for him, it
      works for him. And so the more you see him, the more desensitized you become, et cetera.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Obviously I’m for Biden over Trump by… not even close call, but I got to say, and I saw just the
      clips, but Trump looks energetic and in charge and enjoying himself in that debate. And presumably
      if he’s as healthy a year from now, he’ll look that way in a presidential debate. And so getting to
      President Biden, you thought he wouldn’t run 10 months ago and that was my view or my wish, I guess,
      that he might think about arranging a transition even if it’s a messy primary to the next generation
      and so forth, but it looks like he’s running. So what do you think? Is he running? Will he continue
      to be running? How much of a problem is the fact that he’ll be 82? I say this totally not about his
      mental acuity or anything, but he doesn’t look like Trump up there on the stage. And I think that
      they can say until they’re blue in the face that, “Trump’s also an old guy. He is only four years
      younger than Biden.” And maybe the difference it looks doesn’t matter. If you think Trump’s a threat
      to the Republican, if you vote for Biden it’s not a problem that his gait isn’t as limber as
      Trump’s. So give me your general take on all this. And so you talk to a lot of those people and
      you’re in touch with them.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      First, it is strange because we’ve seen the presidency age people, most recently George W. Bush and
      Barack Obama, and we didn’t really see it age Trump too much. And I agree with you that he really
      didn’t look like he’d aged much. I don’t think he looked like he aged when he was at the CNN Town
      Hall. And I don’t know if that’s what orange makeup does for you, but he didn’t look the way that
      when you look back at clips from three years before when you’re dealing with someone in their second
      half of their seventies, whatever, you usually notice it, so he definitely seems like he’s very
      vital. He wasn’t even sniffing, I don’t think he was on his little Diet Coke medicines that he
      takes, but Joe Biden has visibly aged in office. And before I start on all this, I always like to
      preface it by saying, it’s not that Joe Biden is not worth voting for, obviously he is, and Trump is
      unacceptable. It’s just that I still remain completely stunned that he decided to run again. I don’t
      know that he’s going to make it a year and a half on the campaign trail to sign up for another four
      years and tell us that he can lead the free world until January of 2029. I don’t see that. So having
      covered the Congress for all these years, I know that you can function highly as US Senator well
      into your 90s, and that’s what Chuck Grassley’s doing right now at 89 or 90. Joe Biden could do
      that. Joe Biden’s in great shape for an 80-year-old. It’s just that being president of the United
      States is too draining a job for when you are 80. So we were very blessed to have him in the time
      that we did. I believe he can continue to do his job for the next almost two years. I think he’s
      doing an incredibly important job, particularly overseas, in a way that other Democrats probably
      couldn’t have obviously handled so effectively. I don’t believe he’s lost a step mentally. I just
      spoke to someone, a member of Congress, who was with him just a few days ago and said it’s not that
      he doesn’t know what’s going on, he’s not confused, but he’s really tired, he speaks more slowly. At
      the State of the Union he was shouting, he was obviously on some Red Bull, then the next day his
      voice was hoarse. He went straight to Wisconsin and he was tired. There’s a reason… and people say,
      “Oh, he doesn’t do anything until 10:00 and then he stops at 04:00.” Well, Trump never showed up at
      work. He didn’t come down until 12:00. He watched every single cable show and then screamed to
      people on the phone for half the day. Joe Biden can actually do this job without working that much.
      It’s just that in a presidential campaign, when you’re doing things like you’re going on a lot of
      airplanes and you’re going to events at night and stuff, it shows his age. So when I think about the
      fact that he’s so tired now, that he’s visibly aged so much since the campaign began in 2019, that
      he’s not going to be able to hide in the basement. Intuitively, I just feel that he might not be on
      the ticket in November of 2024. I don’t like saying that, but I always believed it was untenable for
      him to run, and now he’s running, and I still think it’s untenable.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Even if his health holds up, let’s hope it does, of course, and that he sticks to his determination,
      how much of a problem do you think it is that, fairly or unfairly, his vice-president, there is some
      chance of her having to assume greater responsibilities or even take over obviously in a second
      term? And how much is the fact that she doesn’t seem terribly to have had a very successful vice
      presidency, again, fairly or unfairly, that’s the appearance, how much of a problem is Harris as the
      running mate to Biden?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      So I think him staying on the ticket and just limping to the finish line is a problem because I
      think that for a lot of Americans, Bill, they don’t follow politics at all, and they can be decisive
      in these elections. 45,000 votes, fewer than 45,000 separated Trump and Biden in 2020. It was not
      the blowout that everyone said it was going to be. The eight to 10 points in the polls, the 8
      million votes. No, no, no. It was in three states. That’s how you win the election through the
      electoral college. And Trump almost won. And so if you think about those voters who they’re not
      tribal, they’re not the people that we worry the most about, the most partisan, the most activated,
      no, these people very well could look at these two guys next November and say, “Trump, at least he
      did the job before, and he’s nuts, but eggs and gas costs less than, and Biden just looks like he
      needs to go home.” So his age, I think even if he can make it through the campaign, is a huge
      liability. And if they’re just trying to pass the presidency on to Vice-President Harris, maybe
      that’s the plan, that’s strange to me because they know that the voters will be taking her into
      consideration, which is why they’re trying to spotlight her now more and highlight her
      accomplishments and give her more attention and visibility and praise. But Trump is going to say,
      “In a couple of months, sleepy Joe’s going to be in the hospital, and we’re going to be stuck with
      Kamala.” And that’s crude, but that’s what he’ll say. And it will matter. And especially if he picks
      Nikki Haley, and he doesn’t have someone crazy like Kari Lake as his VP. I don’t know. That actually
      could matter. These two old guys, one clearly older, an unpopular vice-president, so that’s a real
      factor that could be part of the conversation. So we know that he probably ran because he was afraid
      of the open primary that you and I have been advocating for a year and afraid that would open up
      divides in the party and that people would get upset that he wasn’t openly endorsing her. But he
      can’t openly endorse anybody because the voters pick the nominee. So it wouldn’t have ever been
      appropriate for him to do that. But I feel that he was probably talked into running again because
      people were too afraid of those divides and of alienating Black women, the most critical
      constituency in the coalition. So that’s likely what happened. It doesn’t look good for their
      prospects. As the great James Carville said on Conversations with Bill Kristol , the age thing gets
      worse each week. It doesn’t get better.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      My other slightly heterodox, and it may be an incorrect reason for hoping half a year ago, a year
      ago for a generational turnover for Biden not to run, even if it’s a messy primary, was that people
      are unhappy with the country. And that’s the mood. It’s been the mood for quite a while. And it’s
      understandable after the pandemic and everything else and a challenging world and so forth. So the
      normal argument that look, an incumbent’s always better, especially if he doesn’t have a primary,
      which Biden presumably won’t, not a serious one, always better to have an incumbent than an open
      sea, which is in effect what would happen if he were just to step aside. I take that point that
      incumbents usually win. They don’t always win, obviously as we saw with Trump, and as you saw with
      George H.W. Bush. I served in that administration. And Jimmy Carter, so people overdo a little bit
      how, and we had a string of three incumbents winning with Clinton, Bush and Obama, and everyone
      decided that’s the nature of things. But they were actually pretty close in some of those elections,
      at least Bush’s in ‘04. Anyway, but I feel like when the mood is wrong-track in the country, to use
      the pollsters term, I’m not so sure being an incumbent is such an advantage. I don’t know if Josh
      Shapiro or Gretchen Whitmer or whoever you want with the nominee, they could say, “Well, I don’t
      entirely agree with President Biden. I think President Biden should have done a little more on
      crime.” Obviously you’re going to be the Democratic candidate. Obviously you’re pro-Biden. Obviously
      you’re going to praise him effusively at the convention, and there’s going to be a lot of praise of
      Joe Biden. But I just think having someone who could do a little bit of distancing wouldn’t be crazy
      in this environment. But maybe I’m just underestimating how bad the primary would be, how nasty the
      debates would be, how much of an advantage Biden, having done it for four years, would be. Those are
      all reasonable concerns on the other side, I suppose.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Of course, I’m with you, Bill, that I think that if Biden said, “Look, we have this great,” to use
      Bill’s pair, “this great pair of leaders, Governor Whitmer of a blue state of a swing, important
      battleground of Michigan and Reverend Warnock, senator from the important swing state of Georgia,
      they’re the next generation. They have their own ideas. They need to make a new Democratic Party,
      but most importantly, they are in touch with the America of today, and Donald Trump is not, and it’s
      time to turn a page, and that old man needs to go home just like me.” I just think it would be
      incredibly energizing to have, when the entire country is dreading the choice of Trump and Biden.
      They don’t want either one. So I always thought that was the right thing to do. And of course they
      would have a little independence, like you said, to create distance while obviously championing the
      issues that unite the party. And abortion and mass shootings are top of mind for young voters and
      will very much drive the turnout of young voters in the next cycle. And so they could concentrate on
      the things that they agree on while saying crime is a serious issue and we need to control the
      border or whatever they would need to do. But to know that you were locking down critical electoral
      college states with next generation leaders against Trump would be obviously the smartest move, I
      think.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And like you said to me a month ago, we were just chatting, that the thing that undercut the
      Stoddard-Kristol plan the most was probably the 2022 results where Democrats outperformed, right?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Yeah. And so last year when you and I talked, I was expecting a huge … There was so much tension
      last summer between the progressives and the moderates in the Democratic Party and this divide that
      was the hangover from the Build Back Better fight. And the progressives didn’t get what they wanted.
      And after we spoke, of course, we spoke about a month after the Dobbs decision, right? Is that…?
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Just around the time of the decision.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      About, yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think it was about a month after, yeah.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      And then I guess they had just passed the gun legislation, but then there was this slew of the CHIPS
      Act, the PACT Act. So, all of a sudden, they went to the midterms with this serious rage against the
      Dobbs decision helping them and then also a slew of legislative accomplishments. And everybody
      united around the abortion decision and the party, they didn’t fight with each other, but they still
      expected to lose a lot of seats, in which case they were anticipating a huge come-to-Jesus moment in
      the party. I thought that was going to affect the leadership elections, and it would have. If there
      was a slaughter, it would have been a huge fight about how to mobilize young people and all the
      stuff that the far left always talks about and how to swing swing districts. And that didn’t happen.
      They were not able to divine a message except that abortion helps us, and so they never had the
      talk. And so it’s so interesting—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And that Biden was a good leader because they did pretty well.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      And it looked great for Biden. It looked great for Biden. He defied history. And so they carried on
      in a united front. And again, as you and I said, another opportunity to say, “I’m going to be a
      great one-term president, and the midterms is another accomplishment,” but still walk away. But he
      dawdled. It was going to be after Christmas, then after the State of the Union, and then he goes all
      in. The midterms were no excuse for him to run. It’s no mandate for him to run. But another thing I
      think the people around him tell him is another one of his strengths, that he’s always
      underestimated, that the middle of the country understands him, that the Democratic candidates
      running in the most tough races were able to decouple and distance themselves from him, that he is
      not toxic, that Americans don’t energize against him. And that all can be true, and you can still be
      too old to run again.

      You talked to so many members of Congress and staff, but really members mostly, privately and
      sometimes off the record or in the background. I’m just curious, on both the Republican and
      Democratic side, how discomforted are most of the Republicans with the prospect of Trump? And is
      that going to have any effect? So revert to our earlier conversation about Trump for a minute. But
      then I’m very curious on the Democratic side, are they confident? Are they worried? Or they just
      feel like this is the hand we’ve been dealt and we have to play it out? And I don’t know, what are
      they telling you?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard

      Democrats are very worried, and they wish that he had stepped aside, not stepped down from his job,
      but refused a second term. And they feel stuck with it, and there’s nothing you can do. No one’s
      saying anything on the record, and they believe that this is an enormous risk.

      Are they worried about the general election? They’re in touch with their own districts. A lot of
      them are swing-ish.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Yes. I think that the serious-minded Democrats know that the age issue alone could decide it. That’s
      just a fact. We have close elections, and Trump, he has survived and come back and looks like he’s
      going to be the nominee. So some of them will definitely tell you, “Oh, he’s going to lose. He’s
      totally going to lose. We’re going to take the House back.” But a lot of them are very worried. And
      then universally, no one wanted Biden to run again. On the Republican side, they’re having trouble
      picking a candidate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s interesting. Some of the Democrats …Wait a minute. I’m so struck by what you said. So I
      talked maybe a little more, I talked some of them, but I talk to a lot of the not-for-profit world,
      the Democratic democracy activists, and they’re much more confident that Trump will lose again. And
      MAGA is clearly a minority view, and they say these outrageous things, and they’re struck with these
      outrageous positions, all of which is sort of true. But I am struck, if I can extrapolate just a bit
      from what you’re saying, that the elected politicians who actually are in touch with voters, unlike
      democracy activists, as much as I love them, who don’t even have to be and aren’t in touch with
      voters because they’re not running for anything, that the elected Democrats are more nervous about
      the general election in 2024 than the Democratic good government types. Is that your sense?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right. Not all—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The closer they are to the voters, the more nervous they are.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Exactly. So if you’re from a safe district, you’re like, “He’s going to lose again. It’s going to be
      awesome. We’re going to take the House back and be in the majority.” And if you saw what happened in
      New York, let’s say in 2022, basically tipping the majority to the Republicans in seats that they
      lost because Kathy Hochul ignored crime and gave herself a competitive election. And Lee Zeldin was
      a good candidate and surged a bunch of turnout among Republicans and swing voters, and they picked
      up some seats. Look, there’s a reason to be nervous, and enough people are feeling that reason, I’m
      just saying. I do want to give you that caveat that there’s so much dismissal like, oh, it’ll be the
      fifth election that they lose with Trump. And that could be true. I just don’t buy that it’s a slam
      dunk for Biden at all. His numbers are terrible. Low turnout for Democrats will be the key to
      Trump’s victory because there’s apathy in the coalition. They have erosion with Asians, erosion with
      Black voters, erosion with Latino voters. And Biden’s support among Black voters has dropped 30% in
      two years. This is really horrible.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Presumably, I think the pros will say, “Well, they’ll come back and vote Democratic anyway.”
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      You know what? I think that no, no, it’s never that they’ll vote Republican. It’s that a lot of
      people will sit this out if they’re mad. They didn’t get voting rights. They didn’t get police
      reform. There’s a lot of frustration among Black voters about the fact that the Democrats always
      think they can count on their vote. So it’s a very serious matter. And I think Democrats in
      swingier, more competitive environments understand that, that these are close margins, and that
      Biden’s unpopularity is pretty strong across the board. And so that’s a problem. On the Republican
      side, Republicans are having trouble recruiting candidates because they don’t want to run next year
      when Trump is running. And that’s a really interesting, hasn’t-really-been-talked-about-yet issue.
      But do you want to run with Donald Trump? Do you want to start a political career and raise the
      money and run in this environment defending him? It sounds like fun, right? So that’s interesting.
      And the other thing about how crazy this whole environment is, is that Democrats and Republicans,
      they both feel that the Democrats are likely to take the House and that the Republicans are likely
      to take the Senate. And that’s something that I find a bunch of people in both parties agree on.
      Again, everything could completely turn around in the next 12, 14 months, but that’s pretty
      interesting right now, that that seems to be the safe bet, a bipartisan safe bet.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I also think, if it’s a Biden Trump race, there could well be a third party, well, there always are
      third and fourth parties of some kind that could be a more centrist, maybe No-Labels-backed, third-
      party ticket that I assume won’t ultimately go anywhere much and may go nowhere or may go for a
      while and then fade some. But of course, if it gets 2, 3, 4%, it could still be very important,
      given that the margin is less than that in key states. And there’s a lot of evidence that the 2016
      voters who voted third, fourth party, they didn’t have that chance in 2020, and Biden won two-thirds
      of them and it probably was key to his margin in some of those really close states. So I feel like
      the chances of a semi-credible, younger-looking, now that doesn’t quite include Manchin so maybe
      he’s not the right person for this, third party fusion-ish candidacy. Time for change, get beyond
      the polarization, we can’t have these two old guys again, ridiculous, what does that ever work, we
      deserve a better choice. I feel like that gets a little more momentum if it’s Biden versus Trump as
      opposed to Whitmer or Shapiro or Warnock or whoever you want, Buttigieg and a million other people
      against Trump. And that probably takes votes ultimately from Biden. It’s dismissed by the pros
      because the pros know that these third parties never go anywhere. They never go anywhere, but they
      did actually affect the results of the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. So that’s two of the
      last, what, six or something like that. So it’s not nothing. I don’t know. I get the sense just
      talking to people, and I include myself in this criticism, that we know it’s ultimately a two-party
      race. We think it’s probably going to be Biden versus Trump. We don’t quite appreciate how much
      unhappiness there is out there at that choice. And I think obviously if you think Trump is a total
      existential threat, you go vote for the alternative, even if he’s too old or whatever. And if it’s
      Biden, some of us will do so pretty cheerfully, even though it might be nicer if he were younger.
      But I don’t know, younger voters, as you say, voters who are not connected closely to politics, the
      chances that they’re staying home, I think, starts to go up quite a lot, doesn’t it, in a Biden
      Trump race. That’s where I worry about the polling might show Biden up by one or two, but I don’t
      know. Who knows? In 2020 people were energized. Would they be on the Democratic side after various,
      as you said, grievances with Biden and lack of alarm, a lack of as much alarm as they might have
      with Trump?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Biden was a relief. He was rescuing the country from Trump. Biden’s the incumbent now. He’s not
      rescuing the country from Trump. He’s going to campaign, he’s going to talk that way. And you and I
      see it that way, but to the average American, it’s like, no, no, no, you had your chance. Everything
      costs more now. There’s been a lot of change. ChatGPT, things are coming at me. I’m very unhappy.
      And so he is not coming out of left field. He’s the sitting president. It’s very different. And I
      always like to remind people that woman in the suburbs who has a college degree or more degrees and
      came out to vote against Donald Trump, she’s coming back out. She’s never going to stop coming out.
      Young people are very energized about guns and abortion. They are not energized against Trump. They
      don’t lie in bed at night and worry about Donald Trump and democracy. Unfortunately, they just
      don’t. If they are the politically involved, politically informed young person, they turned out in
      the midterms, they’re going to turn out in the presidential. It doesn’t mean that all the kids my
      kids’ age are going to vote because they’re tuned out of politics. They think it’s insane, and they
      prefer not to know anything about it. And they don’t follow the news, and they’re horrified. And we
      have a mass of apathy in that generation. And so you can look at what an advantage it is for
      Democrats when those voters vote for Democrats by 28 points. But again, the only thing that
      activates them are guns and abortion, in my view, and it doesn’t activate enough of them. In fact,
      fewer of them turned out in 2022 than they did in 2018. So it’s really a question of, how many
      voters can they get off the couch on the Democratic side? And I think it’s harder than they think.
      It’s not Biden coming in to rescue, to give us a break from this man who’s literally telling Bob
      Woodward that the virus is dangerous while he’s lying to us about it, telling us to drink bleach,
      all the madness. Lafayette Square on June 1st of 2020. Just one thing after another. We could never
      catch a breath. We’ve caught our breath. People have forgotten. So it’s a different dynamic, and I
      think that Democrats just assume that it’s the same as 2020. It’s not.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s very well said, and I think it’s very shrewd actually, that people always want to fight
      the last election, but very different when you’re the incumbent. God knows, I was in the George W.
      Bush White House and he wasn’t a bad president at all. And people are tired, they want to change.
      Now, changing back to the guy from before is very unusual, and especially when it’s Trump. So
      there’s some Republicans probably would be better off to just nominate Nikki Haley and then have a
      normal “election”, and win in a wrong track environment. Sort of a… But having said that, yeah, I
      agree. Trump’s not as much of a disqualifier as a lot of us would hope. What about the Hill? We
      talked about Congress. You covered almost full-time. We cover White House too. But we thought it
      might be pretty crazy this year. So far it’s been a little crazy. We’ll see what happens with debt
      ceiling in the next couple of weeks, but maybe a little less crazy than we expected. But I mean, how
      much turmoil do you expect to see from Congress? From the investigations, debt ceiling, Ukraine aid
      votes? Or do you think maybe at the end of the day we’ll look back, if we talk again in December,
      and say, didn’t really change the dynamics of American politics. Didn’t really reveal that much
      about either party. Or will it … I mean, what’s your guess and what’s your analysis?
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Well, the debt ceiling debate has been so interesting, because I really assumed that Joe Biden had
      some kind of plan. And it would be a process, jujitsu exit ramp where he gets to say, I didn’t give
      them spending cuts on the debt ceiling. They didn’t hold it hostage. They gave me a clean debt
      ceiling increase, but I am in favor of clawing back covid funds and doing some things, and making
      these budget spending cuts in the budget and the annual spending bill. And so if there was a way to
      suspend it for the summer, punt it to the September fight, that’s what we all kind of anticipated
      and that didn’t happen. And then at the same time, Kevin McCarthy’s strength, and I think he is not
      a political strategic thinker, and he’s blundered in different ways that have really built his
      reputation. I’m not taking back my criticism of him. But he has outperformed expectations because he
      is very, very good at what McConnell and Nancy Pelosi are good at, which is the carrot feeding of
      the individual members, and constant communication with the rank and file about their needs and
      wants. He doesn’t have master strategy in his brain the way that Mitch and Nancy do. He’s not a
      badass in the way they are, he is a bumbler. But something has happened since the 15 rounds of
      voting for speaker, where he has managed to keep the loudest Freedom Caucus members who were full of
      threats, quiet. Matt Gaetz is quiet. Chip Roy is quiet. This is an incredible accomplishment.
      Because he was able to get them around the table to agree on a bill that would increase the debt
      ceiling. Most had said they wouldn’t vote for a bill to even increase the debt ceiling. So they
      voted for this bill with all their cuts. They united as a conference and they remain united as
      conference. He convinced all of them that if you start going on Fox and crapping on me, it’s going
      to hinder my hand with Biden. I have better leverage with Biden if you stay on sides. And he has
      kept them under the tent. I don’t know how long it lasts, I don’t know what the final compromise is
      that has to go through the Senate Democrats and then attract 10 Republican senators, or whatever’s
      going to happen. This could get very, very difficult, very quickly. But McCarthy has succeeded
      because of how intensely he communicates with people. And God knows, Bill, what he has promised
      them. We didn’t know that in January, and we don’t know what he’s continued to promise them. But for
      their silence, he has definitely talked a good game, because it’s succeeded in silencing the Freedom
      Caucus. And so, again, I don’t know how long that lasts. But this, to this date, is very impressive.
      And I think that Biden now is facing that loud left that he hasn’t heard from. Pramila Jayapal is
      mad, because he’s saying maybe he will actually agree to Kevin McCarthy’s request for work
      requirements for SNAP and TANIF and other government aid programs. And the left is going nuts. And
      so it’s a bad time when you’ve just announced that you’re running for reelection, and people in the
      party think you’re too old to get in another fight about this stuff. But it is looking like that’s,
      potentially, one of the things he might agree to. Long way until the final package, we don’t know
      the outlines of that today. But I’m surprised that he is in a situation where Kevin McCarthy looks
      so pulled together. The House Republican Conference looks so united. And Joe Biden is getting
      snapped at on the record by Pramila Jayapal. This is not what he wanted.

      It is kind of amazing. I mean, things so often go the opposite from one expects. I mean in 2020, the
      Democrats won the trifecta when they won the Georgia Senates. And everyone thought, okay, this is
      it. But rebound from Trump, Biden gets to govern, he has support and they have to sort of mandate.
      And of course, 2021 was a bad year legislatively for Democrats. Was a huge fight over Build Back
      Better and stuff, Afghanistan pullout, that was more the administration obviously. But a lot of
      criticism, even for Democrats in Congress. Then everyone went in, as you were saying earlier, 2022,
      that’s going to, Democrats badly split. Republicans have all these chances, some decent candidates
      maybe will emerge. And of course the opposite happens. Some horrible Republican candidates emerge.
      Democrats and Biden sort of managed to pull it together for various reasons, and in various ways.
      Including Ukraine, which he responded well to, and where he had bipartisan support. Which sort of
      reminded people that he’s the president, and we should be grateful that he’s the president. I don’t
      know, all kinds of things happened, right? A world of Afghanistan being the headlines is very
      different for a world of Ukraine being the headlines. So 2022 surprised on the upside for the
      Democrats, I think it’s fair to say. They passed all that stuff, they outperformed in November. And
      then everyone decided, and I think you and I sort of had this view that, well, oh man, these
      Republicans are crazy. And the investigations are going to be nuts. And how could this McCarthy, 15
      votes, 15 ballots for the speaker? How could they hold it together? Democrats had incredibly smooth
      transition. You’ve talked about that, how Pelosi pulled that off in a really amazing way, with no
      squabbling even. And the new team comes in, and they’re competent, it seems. Schumer’s been there as
      leader for a while on the Democratic side. And so far, I’ve got to say that in 2023, I don’t think
      it’s been a terrible year for the Democrats, or a great year for the Republicans. But certainly the
      imbalance, I think a lot of people expected. Where the Democrats were going to, as it were, win the
      congressional fight writ large. I wouldn’t say that’s exactly happened. I think the most, the
      craziest Republicans have popped off, but it’s been a one or two day story. The investigations
      haven’t really done a great damage, but they haven’t been humiliating, I wouldn’t say, to the
      Republicans yet. I don’t know, tell me what you think. You cover it. But I do think it’s a weird,
      it’s an interesting, contrarian story so far.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      I think what’s interesting is what has allowed, well again, we don’t know entirely what’s allowed
      Kevin McCarthy to succeed, besides the fact that he works it really hard internally. But in terms of
      Ukraine funding, he spoke out strongly in support of Ukraine when we least expected it a few weeks
      ago, right after Tucker was pulled off the air. And I think that bodes well for the fact that
      there’s still support among the donor class, and much of the elected elites, for supporting a fight
      against Vladimir Putin, the invader. And that is a good thing. I think that once Kevin McCarthy
      figured out that it wasn’t a wave, and it wasn’t a slaughter. And he didn’t have enough seats to
      impeach Joe Biden. I mean, I think with a big margin he would’ve been under serious pressure to do
      so. And he basically told them, we only have a few seats and we can’t do what you guys have planned.
      So far the investigations are, I think the Hunter stuff is getting a little serious. There’s a
      report out today that IRS agents looking into this stuff were pulled off there at the request of the
      Department of Justice. This is I think going to continue to be a serious problem for Joe Biden. And
      I thought the Republicans were going to sort of come out with it right away, but it looks like they
      probably look like they want to drag it out closer to the election, which probably makes sense. But
      they’re dribbling out some good headlines, good fundraising stuff. Their investigation into Alvin
      Bragg and stuff is silly. And again, the voters don’t know that. They see on Fox that they’re
      fighting the justice department, and they don’t know that Congress can’t intervene in a pending
      investigation, and they can’t give the documents. But again, they send in the money, and Jordan gets
      to go home and thunder and roar. And it’s worked for them. But I do think that Republicans still
      have a chance to very seriously overstep. But there also could be very real stuff. And I think that
      is potentially a problem for the Democrats But the small margin really did stop McCarthy from having
      to give in to the madness. It’s like, we’re this close, guys, to losing the house. A couple of you
      could get sick or die, and we’re going to be back in a Democratic majority. So just holds your
      horses. And that’s the reality. And it definitely calmed down their great and grand ambition to at
      least impeach Mayorkas and Merrick Garland, do a lot of whatever. And potentially Joe Biden. They’re
      not pursuing it. Because I think they feel the very real knife’s edge between having the Democrats
      take power again. So that’s what I was expecting. I was expecting a big Republican margin that was
      going to buffer them, and let the crazies rule. So it’s a challenge for the Democrats to respond to
      that, and they need to get their head around the fact that McCarthy has landed in a good spot right
      now. At least tactically.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, that’s such an important point. And we’ll close with that. I do feel like the Democrats haven’t
      done a very good job of taking all these mini-scandals and embarrassments, George Santos and stuff,
      they haven’t really wrapped it around the Republican’s neck. So it’s sort of well, Santos is a
      bizarre story, and here’s the latest detail of that. But no one thinks, I don’t know, that somehow,
      shouldn’t the speaker do something about that? Or shouldn’t his colleagues do something? And that’s
      been true of Gosar and others. And so the Democrats are not very good at sort of attaching the worst
      things any one Republican member does to the whole conference. And McCarthy has done a decent job of
      getting Marjorie Taylor Green and Gaetz and all to speak up less. I guess maybe the speaker vote
      thing, which was sort of an short-term embarrassment to McCarthy was kind of also a wake-up call for
      all the others that we can’t go through, it would hurt them all if everything just broke. They
      needed to ultimately come together and play the hand they had. And as I say on the flip side, I am
      struck at the Democrats lack of political skill, it feels to me. I mean they should be… I don’t
      know, maybe I’m wrong, and maybe they’re holding back their fire, it’s too early and so forth. They
      did all vote for this budget that has all kind of budget cuts, the debt ceiling-slash-budget-
      legislation that does have a lot of budget cuts in it, presumably. We’ll see if they can make
      Republicans pay for that.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Right. Well I mean, they tried. They tried to say it was cuts to veterans and stuff, but I think
      they’re used to only fighting against Trump. And I will add, Bill, it’s not beyond the possibility,
      because Trump said so at the town hall and he has since said on Truth Social, if the Republicans
      don’t demand this and they don’t demand that, and of course he recommend that they do a default. So
      look, as this gets more difficult in the next few weeks, it’s not… And then of course, even if we
      move beyond this, he’s going to try to force them to shut the government down again on the
      government funding fight for September. He wants the confrontation, and he wants to be their leader,
      and dominate, and push them around. So I’m going to be surprised if he stays out of it. I mean, I
      think he’s going to be, when it gets really tense and there’s like some real stuff on the table, if
      it looks like McCarthy’s about to convince his members to support it and it can pass Schumer’s
      Senate, I’m sure Trump’s just going to get in there and editorialize. He could be an exacerbating
      factor, and he could make it very hard for McCarthy. Hard to see why he wouldn’t. But I guess
      stranger things have happened.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I mean he’s a huge wild card, as you say. I mean, in a way, the best case for Trump is if he gets to
      scream and yell about how it’s a sellout, and then quietly let it go through, not actually put too
      much pressure on members. Because Trump does not actually want, presumably… In a certain way he
      wants, I don’t know, does he want a crisis? I mean, it’s true if we have a huge crisis in default
      and the market’s down 2000 points in one day, I suppose Trump says this is, see, what I warned you
      about. It never happened when I was president. This is Biden. I mean, I don’t know. Trump could sort
      of win either way. Or if it doesn’t happen, he’ll attack the Republicans for selling out on the
      Hill, which the base will like, and there’ll be no consequences. I don’t know. Maybe we’re being
      too…

      I’m glad you weren’t so you weren’t watching CNN , Bill. But when he said, “I think this time we

      toy with this concept, and it’s far too dangerous, and it’s not even remotely on the table.” Or
      something like that. And she said, “Why’d you say that then?” And he said, “Because I was president

      sweat off his. So it was one of the low moments of the night, and there were many.

      Yeah, but that’s such a revealing one. I’m glad, I don’t know if I’m glad, we call it closer to
      that. But it’s appropriate to… Because it is so, I mean it’s utterly shameless. You shouldn’t be
      able to say that. Which is literally saying, of course if I’m president, I can’t tank the economy.
      If Biden’s president, who cares? Let him pay a massive political price. We’ll just blame him. But
      just, as what is, and what do we call that? Saying the quiet thing out loud, or whatever? That’s
      what Trump does. But I don’t know. He’s paid no price, right? And in some ways people think, yeah,
      that’s right. That’s why we need to have him as president again. Because when he is president, we
      won’t have this crisis. Oy. Any last thoughts that we haven’t covered? We’ve covered a lot. But I
      guess, just final. So, if we get back together in, you know, Christmas, or at the end of this year,
      of this calendar year, debt ceiling will be big, I suppose. Possible government shutdown, and where
      we end up on that in September. Ukraine aid.

      I mean, I always hold out the hope that the Biden administration, because they went through this in
      2011 and they have been talking about this and studying it for years, that there’s no such thing as
      prioritization. That even talking about that sends a message to global markets, could threaten our
      credit rating. They were never going to have another downgrade because we came too close in 2011. I
      mean, that they had put so much mental energy into this, from experience, I still am sort of holding
      out that maybe in the end this isn’t a big deal, and they come up with something to get through it.
      And I don’t think that it’s going to hurt Biden’s numbers if McCarthy ends up looking good. I don’t
      think voters are going to go, “Boy, Joe Biden didn’t play six-dimensional chess, and Kevin McCarthy
      got the better of him.” I think we’ll just move on. And it’ll just be good for Kevin McCarthy, but
      not bad for Joe Biden to have averted default. But I do think, and I really hope, I’m really being
      optimistic on Ukraine. That we’re in a situation now, where people got mad at Ron DeSantis in the
      party about his remarks. Donors left him over those remarks, and he equivocated. And that message
      from Kevin McCarthy, I thought, was very promising. So I’m hoping that it’s very bad for Joe Biden
      actually going into reelection, I think, if it looks like we are in a quagmire. And that he’s not
      giving Ukraine the ability to win, he’s just giving Ukraine the ability to not lose. If that drags
      on into next year, past the two-year mark, I think that that actually is an electoral liability for
      him. So I think he’s invested in their success, I think the Republicans are going to help out with
      that, I hope. I don’t see that being a big thing. But I’m just focused on Biden and Trump. And I
      just have this weird feeling that something will intervene. At least one of them will not be on the
      ticket. I think there’s more drama in store.

      I think that’s a good prediction. And no, I have the exact same totally irrational kind of gut
      feeling, somehow. Of course, analytically, Trump’s the most likely Republican nominee. And Biden’s
      overwhelmingly likely to be the Democratic nominee. And yet somehow, deep down, I can’t quite
      believe we’re going to have Biden and Trump a year from now. But that lack of belief is worth
      nothing. So I don’t know.

      We’ll have a long time to accept it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      We will. We will have to discuss this, both maybe at the end of this calendar year, or before even
      Labor Day. Let’s see what happens. I mean, even this debt ceiling in the next couple of weeks could
      be pretty, who knows, right? We would not have predicted two months ago that Biden, and Yellen, and
      the Democratic White House and Treasury Department look a little bit like they’re flailing around.
      And McCarthy’s kind of got his budget through the house and is sitting there saying, hey, we’ve got
      to negotiate here. Let’s speed up the negotiations. It’s a little thing. I don’t think it matters.
      Ultimately, what matters is what happens. But it is striking that all the assumptions one makes
      about who might have the upper hand in each of these cases, often they’re not, they’re just not
      right. It doesn’t turn out that way.
  - speaker: A.b. Stoddard
    text: |
      Yeah, I’ve been wrong a lot, and I’m happy to be wrong. It’s kind of part of the fun that you can’t
      really predict it. But we’d like to predict that Trump is not going to be the next president. That’s
      what we would like to be able to predict. Because that’s what matters.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That prediction’s going to be pretty right. No problem. No question at all.
