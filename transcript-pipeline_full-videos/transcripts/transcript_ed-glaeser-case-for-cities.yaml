      Hi. I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined today by Ed
      Glaeser, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard University, a very distinguished micro
      economist. I’m stressing that, Ed, since, I don’t know, I think you micro economists have a slight…
      Disdain’s too strong, but a slight preference for being micro economists to macro economists. Ed is
      known best perhaps as an economist of urban things and of cities, and a student of cities in ways
      that go beyond economics. And maybe we’ll touch on that. But a very excellent book that people
      should read from 2012,
  - speaker: Triumph Of The City
    text: |
      How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Healthier, and Happier . That’s impressive. And
      then a book, Survival of the City , about a year ago. And I saw you just wrote a preface that coming
      up for new edition of Mancur Olson’s…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      I did. The Rise and Decline of Nations .
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      …which is coming out in September, so people should look at that. But we can even get to talk about
      that. That book influenced me some in grad school, I think; and had a big influence in political
      science, maybe more than in economics, I don’t know. Anyway, Ed, thank you for joining me.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Oh, Thank you so much for having me on.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      It’s great to have you. So you’re a fan of the city and the cities and the importance of cities, and
      you’ve studied them in such an interesting way. Why cities? Could you make the basic case for the
      fundamental importance of cities?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. But I want to make it clear from the beginning that I am not advocating that everyone
      should live in cities, nor am I advocating that the federal government should artificially subsidize
      cities. But I think that cities have for thousands of years empowered humanity in ways that are
      incredibly important. I mean, if you think about us as a species, our greatest talent is our ability
      to work together. I mean, on our own, we are really puny creatures. I mean, a few of us could take
      on a bear without external help. But collectively, we’ve done amazing things, and I think we’re
      continuing to do amazing things. And cities have made that possible. Cities enable young people to
      learn how to be productive. They enable people to have fun by connecting with other people. They
      enable us to share joint resources like museums or parks. And they enable companies to find talent
      and to nurture that talent. So there’s a lot to like about cities. In some sense, the most amazing
      thing is the comeback of cities since the 1970s. But I assume we’ll talk about that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, let’s talk about that, because that’s so important, and that’s in all of our memories to
      different degrees and different amounts of memory. But yeah, I mean, it looked like cities were in
      terrible decline, and there were a lot of people who thought it was irreversible. And also, people
      were willing to say, “Well, it doesn’t matter so much anymore. With modern technology, we don’t need
      cities.” And of course, that’s had a little bit of a resurgence during the pandemic. We don’t need
      to be close to each other, proximate to each other, in person. Was the decline real, and what are
      the key policy questions that had to be addressed?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Oh, it was completely real. I was born on the island of Manhattan in 1967, and I lived there for the
      first 17 years. And for most of that time, it felt like the city was in a tailspin. The starting
      point for that—and pretty much all of America’s older, colder cities were in trouble—th starting
      point for that was the industrialization. I mean, if you think about New York city’s past, it was an
      industrial city. The largest industrial cluster in the United States in the 1950s was not automobile
      production in Detroit; it was garment production in New York city. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary
      workers sewing garments, sewing dresses, sewing coats. Those jobs disappeared by the hundreds of
      thousands in the 1960s and early 1970s because transportation costs changed. Garments were in New
      York because it was the hub of this incredible transportation network, based originally on water,
      but then also supplemented with rail. And so it was a really cheap place to get fabric, a really
      natural place to ship the garments from. After World War II, container ships, highways, reductions
      in the cost of rail, all meant that New York’s one time advantage largely vanished. And so why not
      move the dress factory down to South Carolina where the labor’s a whole lot cheaper? Why not move it
      across the ocean where the labor’s cheaper still? And so this happened place and place again to
      America’s older industrial cities because those transportation cost advantages disappeared. Then on
      top of this, you had the perfect storm of having social conditions which kind of went out of
      control. And the rising crime rates of the sixties and the early seventies; a city that tried to
      spend its way out of problems. And so New York teetered on the edge of bankruptcy by the mid 1970s.
      As the Bronx burned, it really felt as if New York was headed for the trash heap of history,
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      What were the key policies in turning that around? Let’s get to the policy stuff.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      There were policies, but the other key thing that’s critical in this is that the most important
      thing that turns this around was the rise of finance. The fundamental thing is that what happened
      was that knowledge became more important. But let’s talk a little bit about policy.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, no, say a word about the finance. And more broadly, maybe, about how much of all this is
      controllable, and how much of this is just circumstances change, and cities rise and fall in
      different geographies and somewhat arbitrarily. Perhaps finance starts in one city and their network
      effects, which we should probably talk about and explain, because that’s such an important part of
      your book. How much are we talking about a kind of… How do you call it… An order that arises of
      itself. There’s a term for this I can’t remember. As opposed to anyone planning anything.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      That’s of course completely true. I mean, the origins of Wall Street are under the buttonwood tree
      in the 18th century. It’s people who are investing in boats that are crossing the ocean, and you
      build this incredible social infrastructure. It’s not at all top down. They’re not policies that
      lead to it. It’s the relationships between bankers and other investors and companies. Companies like
      Standard Oil moved to New York, partially to be near that investment community. And it becomes in
      some sense that, if garments are the low end of New York’s labor market, this, in some sense, is the
      high end. Really after World War II, business services, which includes finance, became the linchpin
      of many of our most successful cities. Before the financial collapse in 2007, 42% of the payroll on
      the island of Manhattan was in finance and insurance. I mean, it was an unbelievably dominant
      industry. I think there’s an even larger point, though, about finance. If you go back to 1980, when
      Alvin Toffler was writing The Third Wave , he was arguing that all the new technologies, the Zooms
      of their era, were largely going to make face to face interaction, and the cities that enable that
      interaction, obsolete. He was looking forward to a world in which Manhattan skyscrapers would be
      empty, and there’d be a great cavernous wasteland on Wall Street and Midtown. And of course for 40
      years, he was completely and totally wrong. I think the main reason that he was wrong is that what
      new technologies, what globalization did, was they radically increased the returns to being smart.
      And we are a social species that gets smart by being around other smart people. That’s ultimately
      what brought people to the maelstrom of New York. When you think about the trading floors of
      financial service industries, there’s something weird about them. Here you are with some of the
      wealthiest people on the planet, and instead of sitting a university dean behind a vast desk inside
      a huge office—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Or like you there, Littauer at Harvard, right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      That’s right. There they are, they’re right on top of each other. They’re yelling at each other.
      They’re getting guacamole on each other, if Liar’s Poker is to be believed. They’re in the midst of
      it. And why are they there? They’re there because in their business, knowledge is more important
      than space. And that’s in some sense why the city came back on a very high level. As you had these
      changes, that just meant the returns to being smart were so much higher. Knowledge became more
      important than space, and people were willing to put up the inconveniences of being in the city in
      order to be close to one another. Of course there were other things that really mattered, like the
      reduction in crime.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      You think of the things that are more government caused or government responsive to government
      policies. Do you think crime was the biggest? And I’m just looking at as we go today. Do you think
      it’s one of the biggest threats, as you hear a lot of worries about a resurgence of a seventies type
      situation in New York and elsewhere?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. I think crime is almost surely the biggest risk that I see. It’s the biggest risk then
      that was government created. It’s the biggest risk now, at least outside of New York. I mean, New
      York is unusual in that it has its own income tax. For most cities, they don’t have the freedom to
      set higher taxes that would scare people off. So at the state level, this is more of an issue. But
      at the local level, the city governments officially constrained that it’s really about deterioration
      in the quality of life for wealthier taxpayers. I guess the way that I think about this, is that
      what happened in the seventies is you had a combination of people being more mobile than ever.
      Highways that had opened up the suburbs, as we discussed earlier. Container ships, trucking, made it
      easier to relocate the factories. And so you had firms and you had talented people who were
      incredibly mobile. At the same time, you had a bunch of city mayors like John Lindsay who saw
      historic inequities. Those inequities were there, but he decided it was the job of city government
      to end those inequities. He decided he wanted to do it by forcing the rich to pay more. Now, the
      problem is, the rich can just flee. They decided they wanted to deal with police brutality by just
      reducing the amount of policing that was going on, by reducing the amount of public safety that was
      being created. And this is something that in a world in which the rich or more mobile, as they are
      more mobile today, partially because of Zoom, if you don’t in some sense create a city that is
      welcoming to them, they will just leave. And that’s, in some sense, what I worry most about today,
      is a repeat of the 1970s, where you have progressive dreams, which are many cases entirely laudable,
      but colliding with the reality that the rich businesses can easily get out.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Let’s come back a little bit to, assuming we do okay, on crime. To this sort of underlying case for
      cities, necessity for cities, and virtues of cities. I mean, I do think this whole network effects
      thing, which is a term that’s become, I guess, fashionable almost in social science. We used to have
      a more technical, perhaps, economics basis, I assume. But it’s worth saying a word about it. I’ll
      just tell one very quick story. So I grew up in New York. We actually went to the same high school,
      though I was 15 years ahead of you, at least. So I remember in the sixties, before each school year
      when I was in grade school and middle school, being taken, my sister and I going with my mother, to
      34th Street and 7th Avenue right near Penn Station, to buy clothes for the school year. I mean
      nothing fancy. As I recall, Macy’s, Gimbels, and Ohrbach’s, these are names from the past, at least
      in the latter two cases, I guess, were on the three of the four corners. I think I’ve got this
      right. On 34th and Broadway, or 34th and 7th. I remember as a 12 year old, having vaguely
      interested, beginning to get interested in things, thinking, “Well, isn’t this a little weird? I
      mean, shouldn’t stores be spread out? Isn’t this inconvenient? Why are they all one place? It seems
      contrary to common sense. There should be one at 34th Street, and one at 72nd Street, and one in
      Brooklyn. And it should be sort of convenient for people.” I remember asking my father maybe, and he
      gave me a very simple version of the virtues of congestion, or of similar businesses being in the
      same place and stuff. To address that, it’s one of those striking things about cities. There are
      these neighborhoods that have all the same thing in one place, you’d think it’d be more convenient
      as a retail matter that they’d be spread out.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      There are many things that are interesting in that example. One of the starting points for that is
      that 34th Street is at the heart of the Garment District. So you’re in the place where the Garment
      District essentially reformed at the start of the 20th century, and it reformed around Penn Station.
      So Penn Station was the transportation technology that enabled the stuff to get in and the stuff to
      get out, and the Garment District formed around that. From there, it becomes fairly natural for
      stores that specialize in clothing to be near the Garment District. So you have one network effect,
      which is the upward linkage from the stores to their customers. But there’s more there, which is if
      you’re going to attract the Kristol family to do their school shopping, it’s convenient for all
      three stores to be nearby, because maybe you’re going to come down and you’re not going to like what
      Macy’s has. To remind us of that famous Miracle on 34th Street, where the real Santa Claus in the
      show tells the family that you should go to Gimbels to buy this. Even if Macy’s isn’t always doing
      that, they have the capacity to do that, or you have the capacity to do it yourself. So having that
      cluster there makes it easier for people to know that that’s a destination where you go to search
      for clothing. An even more famous example that’s still present in New York is diamonds on 47th
      Street between 5th and 6th, where there is an unbelievable cluster of diamond merchants who are
      there, who serve partially the role of having a bunch of institutions that they take advantage of,
      like the Gem Institute that then certifies your diamonds after you buy it. But it’s also so that
      couples who are looking for engagement rings have lots of options, and they know this is the
      destination that they want to go to.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      These things sort of sprung up spontaneously. It reminds me of the term “spontaneous order” in
      Hayek. And I mean, the government didn’t decide let’s have a garment district in the 30s or ajewelry
      street at 47th Street or whatever. Diamond street.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. I don’t know whether or not there’s any government involved in jewels. In the garment
      industry, there are some large developers who play a role in being sort of a first mover who put
      down a lot of space for garments in the 1920s. There’s a guy who I talk about in Triumph called A.E.
      Lefcourt, who, it turns out, built more skyscrapers than any other new Yorker did in the 1920s. He
      comes out of the garment industry. He’s like a cloak manufacturer who starts with nothing, and then
      starts building these factories for the garment industry. He sort of begins the move to create the
      new Garment District anchored around Penn Station.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      The same is true, I guess, of theater and so forth. I mean, they’re just these incredible economies,
      not of scale, but of, I don’t know what, of compression or something, of being near each other. So
      if actors want jobs, you can’t always get one in one play, but you’re going to move to the city that
      has the potential 10 plays and et cetera. If tourists want to come watch plays, they’ll come to one
      city.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      We call these agglomeration economies, the benefits of being around other businesses; sometimes like
      businesses, and sometimes businesses that are either suppliers or customers.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And this is a good thing? That is to say, this is not just— one could say well, this is something
      that’s developed. I mean, is this good economically? Does it increase growth? Does it attract? I
      mean, is it something we should welcome, or something we should push back against? Why should five
      blocks in New York get all the theater, and most of the theater in the US?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      I don’t really want to descend into the econ lingo.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s okay.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      But these agglomerations are rife with what we call externalities, which means that private market
      actors don’t necessarily make the right decision for society as a whole. What that means is you can,
      in fact, have too much concentration, meaning that it would be better if you put some theater
      somewhere else. But the first theater isn’t going to want to detach. Or, you can have under
      concentration, because the theater that would move from the Upper East Side to Broadway isn’t
      internalizing all the benefits that that theater would bring to the other theaters. The problem is
      very rarely, we can guess pretty well that the private market won’t get it right. But we’re very
      rarely sure in which direction it’s gotten it wrong. So it’s a similar question at a very large
      level, which there are externalities from high human capital people living in particular locations.
      But does that mean I should want to drag more skilled people from West Virginia to Silicon Valley or
      stop skilled people from moving from West Virginia to Silicon Valley? I can’t tell you the answer to
      that. And at least for me, I’ve always said that’s another good reason why we probably want a
      federal government that’s spatially neutral, that doesn’t actually play favorites with one area,
      doesn’t actually try to create these clusters, but doesn’t try to stand in their way either. I think
      it’s yet another case for modesty in terms of what we think the federal government should try to do.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But actually, historically these cities and these conglomerations, whether it’s New York City or
      Silicon Valley, do correlate, it seems to be in a very simple minded way with innovation and growth,
      attracting immigrants, which I think I assume you’d agree would be generally a good thing for
      economic growth as well. So say a word about that. I mean…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      No, I think cities have been an unbelievably key for portion of our economic success as a country
      and sort of an oddity as Americans. We tend to think of ourselves as sort of rural frontiersmen
      often, even though most of us are firmly embedded in metropolitan economies. And those economies
      have played a huge role in terms of making America productive. And even, if you think about the
      farmers of the Midwest who were so much a part of our wealth in the 19th and early 20th century,
      they benefited a lot from the fact that Cyrus McCormick moved from Virginia to Chicago to set up his
      reaper business. And he was right in the middle of the city. He was sending out his scouts
      throughout all the cities in the Midwest to see what his competitors were doing and constantly
      upgrading his reaper. This is partially what made us a highly mechanized, highly productive farm
      economy was that we had cities which could then strengthen those farms. That continues to be true
      today, that our cities have often been the wellspring of new ideas, new innovations. And that is
      very much sort of part of our world. Going back historically, it’s even more obvious. I mean, you
      see over and over again, these moments of human brilliance, whether or not it’s Athens in the fifth
      century BC or Florence and the 15th century where connections between one innovator and another. You
      can watch the chain of ideas as it moves from one person to the next. Brunelleschi figures out the
      basic mathematics of making two-dimensional areas seem three-dimensional. He passes that along to
      his traveling companion, Donatello, another Florentine who puts it in low relief sculpture. He
      passes it along to Masaccio who puts it on the wall of the Brancacci Chapel, that amazing picture of
      St. Peter finding a silver coin in the belly of a fish. He passes along to that less than saintly
      monk, Fra Filippo Lippi, pass it along to Boticelli and so forth. A chain of urban brilliance that
      still lights up our world. This is what cities do that’s really important, enable us to create
      amazing stuff and by leveraging the brilliance of others. I mean our ability to be intellectual
      magpies to borrow or steal ideas from people around us has been central to human success over the
      last 3,000 years.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And so let’s talk about the resistance to cities. I mean, Jefferson was worried about what it would
      do to the civic virtues and not entirely unreasonable, I suppose though. Well, anyway, I’m more on
      the Hamilton side of this fight, but I mean, it’s a strain in America, probably a strain,
      particularly among conservatives. And you’re, I think, generally thought to be on the center, center
      right of things. You’re a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. I mean, A, do you find this? Do
      you find that conservatives say, “wait a second, what are you praising cities for? We’re sort of
      pro-rural, pro-suburban and sort of think cities are this either corrupt and/or… you know, it’s
      bloated inefficient governments and a bunch of decaying businesses propped up by subsidies. And why
      are you defending city—?” I mean, how much do you find as a political matter, conservatives are open
      to this argument about cities? And then does it matter? I mean, you want a neutral playing field.
      You don’t want to necessarily the government to tilt the playing field, but…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Right. So it’s political poison, but I want drivers to pay for their highways. I want users to pay
      for their infrastructure. That’s true of JFK Airport, but it’s also true of highways. So I don’t
      want a tax policy that artificially subsidizes mortgages because mortgages are associated with
      living in suburbs more than cities. But also I just don’t want it to have the government sit there
      and encourage ordinary Americans to bet on the vicissitudes of the housing market. I don’t think
      that’s great policy, big policy either. So I think when it gets down to individual policies, it’s
      easier to connect with conservatives. I mean, that’s the view that our government should be quite
      sparing with its social engineering. That’s pretty easy. And I will say my own sort of center
      rightness, it has its origins in watching the markets and the businesses of Manhattan. I mean, my
      mom worked for Mobile Oil, which was located on 42nd Street between Third and Lex in New York. That
      certainly didn’t seem like a left wing organization to me. And it seemed like one that, having some
      degree of filial affinity for it naturally made me sort of a little wary of Jimmy Carter’s anti-oil
      company stuff. So I think that had some role to it. There is a fundamental problem though, which is
      that big cities do actually require more government than rural areas do. There are these
      externalities and we’ve been talking about the good ones, the network effects or the ideas hopping
      from urban genius to urban genius. But there also are bad ones. I mean obviously in today’s world,
      it’s the spread of disease from person to person. And I mentioned fifth century Athens earlier, but
      in some sense, the Golden Age of Athens was permanently derailed by the plague that came to that
      city in 430 BC. I mean, that was partially because of the high density. High density made even
      denser because of Pericles’ strategy of bringing in all the Athenians behind the walls to protect
      them from the Spartan hoplites. But cities are always vulnerable to disease. They have problems with
      traffic congestion, which needs some degree of moderation. They need dealing with the hygienic
      aspects of waste and sewers. In our new book, we sort of focus a lot in the third chapter on the
      19th century fight to make cities livable. And the cities at the start of the 19th century were
      extraordinarily vulnerable to those pandemics that spread across the world in that earlier age,
      yellow fever, cholera. And over the course of the 19th century, urbanites came together and they
      expanded government around clean water around sewers. And that’s actually a kind of government that
      I’m okay with. This was sensible, by and large, user fee funded, but not always. And it was an
      amazing act. In some sense, it’s a moment where governments actually started to save lives instead
      of taking them. I mean, most of governments prior to 1800 were really just in the business of
      killing. I mean, I know we love the fact that Frederick the Great had these erudite correspondences
      with Voltaire. But look, his main business was stealing Silesia from Maria Teresa. His main business
      was fighting. But in the 19th century, cities actually expanded their governments enormously. It was
      mostly about health. And so cities do need more government. And yet of course, as we know, that
      those governments as they expand, we see their failings pretty clearly. And so I think that’s part
      of what creates that juxtaposition that between low density and republicanism, at least which gives
      it some sort of natural roots.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. But it is important to make the point about there are real public goods and real externalities
      that aren’t captured by individual players making decisions like wastewater or something, and which
      presumably have to be dealt with collectively, which means government. I mean right now US policy, I
      mean, net-net, so to speak, is federal policy. What are the biggest things that either help cities
      or hurt cities? I mean, it’s tilted, I kind of got the impression from what you were saying a minute
      ago, that some of the biggest policies are tilted towards the suburbs basically.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      So I would’ve been more comfortable with that five years ago where it’s federal highway aid and the
      home mortgage interest reduction, which I think of as the two big ones. We have had a whole bunch of
      spending for urban transit systems during the COVID response for good or ill. If we end up in that
      business permanently, then that will slightly level the playing field. I will just say my own
      preference is that the users, by and large, pay for both of those things, rather than having cross
      subsidies of urban infrastructure and cross subsidies of rural infrastructure. The only exception of
      that is I’m okay with some degree of modest support for buses that particularly aid poor people. I
      think that’s a quite defensive thing because it’s a critical ingredient in their employment. And
      buses are cheap. They’d be a lot cheaper too if we got rid of the buy American requirements that
      often inflict high costs on our urban transit systems. The biggest problem with our cities, of
      course, is not any federal policy. It’s actually the schools. So that’s a statement of… It’s the
      hardest one to fix. I’m not at all sure of how to fix it. But the fact that so many parents think
      they need to suburbanize to get decent schools for their kids, that’s just an incredible tax on
      urban life.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. That’s such a good point. It’s a kind of an obvious point, I mean, in a way, right? I mean,
      I’m sitting here in Northern Virginia where we moved basically because they had very good public
      school. I mean, there are other nice things about living here, but very good public schools and some
      other amenities but the schools dwarf everything else in importance. And we wouldn’t have been
      confident in that when we moved down here in DC. So yeah, I mean it is… One sort of takes it for
      granted is the thing that, well, yes, you go to the suburbs to get the good public schools, whether
      it’s Westchester or Sugar Heights or Maryland or Virginia. But of course, why is that the case? It
      needn’t be the case. There’s no intrinsic law about that.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      I’ve never heard of a single Frenchman who thought they needed to leave Paris to get better schools
      for their kids. That just doesn’t happen.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But so real education reform, whatever exactly that would be, would really make a difference you
      think in terms of…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      I think so. I think either if you went to a sort of just more widespread voucher system where sort
      of there’s competition everywhere and where you live doesn’t determine the quality of the school
      system that you go to. Or I don’t believe America could pull this off, but if we were going to be
      French and [inaudible French] and actually ensure it’s Tuesday at 4:00 PM, I know what every third
      grader is being taught everywhere in France. Either direction would level the playing field. It’s
      just our traditions of American local schooling mean that we have a particular problem in terms of
      our urban schools.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I suppose the way I’m just thinking out the way our immigration happened, cities were the magnets
      for immigrants. Maybe that’s the case in most of human history. But immigrants come in mostly
      poorer. And so cities are the raucous, uneducated immigrants and their kids who don’t know English
      very well, flooding the public schools. And if you’re a middle or upper middle class, non-immigrant
      who… Fine, that’s good that the city should help those kids. But you know what? I’ll just go to
      school here in a slightly more sedate and less challenging environment in the suburbs. And that must
      have something and that’s sort of historical. Is that an accident that cities are so much the
      magnets for immigrants? Or am I overstating it or…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      No. You’re correct. And I want to just add to it, cities also attract poor people because of their
      public transportation technologies. That in fact, you don’t have to own a car for every adult, which
      is unfortunately what you actually need to have mobility in much of America’s suburbs to get around.
      And so whether or not you’re a poor immigrant or just a poor family, cities enable you to access
      jobs without owning the automobiles. So that’s another force which pulls poor people into cities. Or
      put conversely, rich people move to the suburbs first because they could afford the cars that were
      required to make them accessible. And so if cities are going to disproportionately attract poor
      people, then that’s going to create challenges for the school system that need to be, in some cases,
      will just lead the rich to exit. And that’s what certainly has happened sometimes.

      I was struck in one of the books, you’re somewhat critical of Jane Jacobs, who I read as a, I don’t
      know, high school, early college and sort of liked. I think I was supposed to like that. There was a
      left-right agreement that Jane Jacobs’ criticism of Robert Moses… and all this. And for me as a more
      conservative type, it fit into a certain kind of, again, critique of the fatal critique of Robert
      Moses think he could plan everything. But say a word about what Jane Jacobs argued maybe. It’s a
      very famous book. I’m not sure it is as famous anymore. It was sort of a big deal when I was in
      college. But it was called The Life and Death of —
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      …of American Cities. The Economy of Cities is also good and also influenced me enormously. Life and
      Death of Great American Cities is in many ways, a great book. Most ways in fact, it is a great book.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This is from, what, the early ’60s, I think, the book?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      ’61 I think is—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I think that’s right.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Its description of the ballet of street life is extraordinary. Its understanding of what’s great
      about neighborhoods like Greenwich Village is fantastic. Her ability to understand that the Le
      Corbusier-inspired public housing projects of the 1950s were headed for disaster was great,
      partially because they just didn’t build on this human scale. They were guilty of one of the two
      great sins of city building, which is monumentalism, building for the sake of the structures, not
      realizing that the real city isn’t made of concrete. It’s human flesh. And unless the buildings wrap
      around humanity’s needs, they’re completely useless. And Jane Jacobs was absolutely peerless on that
      stuff. Where she erred, and it’s like a thing which, as an economist, it seems obvious, but as a non
      economist, maybe it doesn’t, was she was in fact guilty of the other great sin, which is NIMBY-ism,
      “not-in-my-backyard-ism.” And the reason for that, and she has a chapter which is the chapter that I
      pick on in triumph is why cities need old buildings. And she compares old buildings and new
      buildings, notice that old buildings are cheap and new buildings are expensive, which leads her to
      conclude that no one should replace old buildings with new buildings. And then she became this sort
      of advocate of the Greenwich Village Historic Preservation District, which basically froze all
      development in Greenwich Village in amber. Now the problem with that reasoning of course, is that
      there’s no repealing the laws of supply and demand. And if you have heavy demand for a neighborhood
      like Greenwich Village, and you say, we’re not going to build anything, that’s not a recipe for
      affordability. That’s a recipe for eight million dollar townhouses because you’ve essentially made
      it impossible for the market to react. And the new buildings may be slightly more expensive, but you
      make the old buildings cheaper if you put up a 50 story building in the neighborhood to supply more
      units. And while she’s certainly right, that Greenwich Village is wonderful space, I grew up in a
      much taller building than those buildings. I don’t think our street life around the 69th Street and
      First was so bad. And that also works. And I think using any form of public regulation to say that
      there’s only one way to build a city just feels like it’s a mistake to me. And while she was right,
      that her way of her neighborhoods are great, but there are lots of other ways to have great
      neighborhoods. And some of them can be a lot denser.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And I guess it must have caught on. It must have fit in with the anger, maybe justified, I suspect
      of the destruction of Penn Station and the total lack of recognition of historical landmarks may
      have gone too much to the other direction on that. I don’t know, but I take it your form of defer to
      markets and supply and demand demand doesn’t preclude a certain amount of protecting of great
      buildings and so forth?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      My father was an architectural historian. I believe that there are many buildings that are as
      precious to humanity as the works of Masaccio and Botticelli. I just don’t think that every glazed
      brick building in the Upper East Side of Manhattan is vital to preserve. I think we need to have
      some serious thoughts about what are the costs and benefits here. And we shouldn’t act as if this is
      a free lunch, that we get to both preserve architectural heritage and maintain affordability. I
      think the proposal that I threw out was, let’s just have some fixed set of buildings that we’re
      going to protect those buildings and maybe a few other extra neighborhoods, and let’s be much more
      limited about saying a whole vast neighborhood like the Upper East Side of New York is going to be
      part of a historic preservation district.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And is that the case now? Is that what they’re talking about?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      There are huge amounts of, yeah, there is an Upper East Side historic preservation district.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Just those normal apartment buildings on Park Avenue or Fifth Avenue?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Perfectly nice buildings, yeah.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      There’s a ton of ordinary stuff that is preserved, not just in New York. And it becomes harder in a
      city like Bruges, where it fits together as an ancient historical thing. So I’m really okay with
      leaving Bruges intact. Paris, probably we want to preserve larger areas, but it probably still would
      be good to have more escape valves. La Defense has proven to be one, but I’m okay to [inaudible]
      slightly more tall buildings closer to the city center. But it’s a balance. And I’m certainly not
      against historic preservation in any sense. It’s just, we need to recognize that there are costs to
      it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I suppose we’ve been very New York centric here, as is appropriate for the two of us in this
      conversation. But we should say what about the massive growth of the Sunbelt cities, which I don’t
      know if people really expected that 30 or 40 years ago. I think people might have expected movement
      to the Sunbelt. I don’t know if they really expected the cities to become so big and city-like for
      all the sprawl. But say a word about, I guess I was thinking about your historic preservation, there
      can be cities that have historic preservation and others that don’t, right? And that’s also in a big
      country probably a good thing to have a certain amount, let New York be New York and let Houston be
      Houston. But say a word about the general, what about these, what about the Houstons and Atlantas of
      the world?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Okay. So first let’s put two facts on the table. One of which is, there is no variable that I know
      of that better predicts metropolitan area growth over the course of the last 120 years than January
      temperature. January temperature is the biggest [inaudible] variable. Now, some part of that is just
      Americans liking warmer weather. And I will say as someone who’s lived in new England for the last
      30 years, I think it shows an awful lack of character. But de gustibus non est disputandum , right?
      There’s no arguing with taste. They are what they are. As an economist, I’m bound to respect it. I
      respect them. But on top of that, there are other public policies that go along with this. So if we
      think about the South in 1950, not California, the South in 1950 is still the Jim Crow South. And
      you go back and watch In the Heat of the Night , that marvelous movie with Sydney Poitier from the
      ’60s, this is a movie about a Northern industrialist building—I think it’s a textile plant—in
      Mississippi. And all sorts of bad things ensue, which suggests some of the things that might have
      been restricting development of the South. Now, over the past 70 years the South has gone from being
      relatively anti-business to being relatively pro-business. It’s the place of Right-to-Work states,
      it’s the places that have … And the work of Tom Holmes of the University of Minnesota looks at
      counties on different sides of state lines where you have Right-to-Work borders and shows huge added
      industrial growth after 1947 in those counties, those states that have been pro-business.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And Right-to-Work being a very important part of pro-business, as opposed to taxes or all the other
      stuff?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Okay, so we’ve got 50 states. All of them have a cocktail of policies. It is very hard to say that
      it’s Right-to-Work versus lower taxes versus something else. We know that all of these things tend
      to go together, but it’s very hard to parse out which is the most valuable. We also have pro-housing
      policies. You don’t understand why Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix have added so many units since
      the last 30 years without understanding that they make it incredibly easy to mass produce housing.
      And that’s part of the magic. The second fact is that if anything, that Sunbelt trend has been
      magnified over the last two years. So partially because people like being outside, partially because
      probably the more relaxed attitude towards COVID has appealed to many people. When I look at the
      data over the 2019 to 2021 period, it feels like it’s the past 40 years on steroids. We actually, in
      the paperback edition of that’s coming out this fall, we actually have a list of ranking the 50
      metropolitan areas and how they fared over COVID. 17 out of the top 25 are in the Sunbelt, with
      Austin, Texas leading the pack. And so places like Austin that are both relatively pro-business and
      really skilled, those are the real winners. And Atlanta falls in that category as well. They also
      are pretty urban. It’s not as if these are not real metropolitan areas with really dense cores that
      have real network effects going on in them. Even if your average Houstonian may think of themselves
      as being a cattle rancher, they really are living in one of the world’s great metropolitan areas,
      great urban areas.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s interesting about Austin and Atlanta. The ideal thing is maybe to be a bluish city in a
      red state with pro-business policies and affordable and easy housing. But if you’re the type of
      person who wants more of a culturally left, let’s just say experience and environment, you get that
      too, right? Austin I think is, especially if you’re a university town, that’s one of the things that
      I never would have predicted, that being a university town, am I wrong about this though? Turns out
      to be kind of a big plus in economic development.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. For both growth and wages. Enrico Moretti of Berkeley, he pioneered the use of land
      grant colleges prior to 1940 to look at the impact of having skilled workers. And they’re very
      predictive of success, having a land grant college prior to 1940. It’s directly skilled workers, but
      it’s also, after the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 makes it possible to commercially license research that
      was funded with federal dollars, you have an explosion of businesses around university towns in
      industries that are related to their traditional research expertise. That’s from work of Naomi
      Hausman.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That’s so interesting, because I don’t know, I’m trying to remember when I was in high school. Ann
      Arbor, Madison, we thought they were kind of fun places because they were college towns. And if
      you’re on the left, they were lefty places. I don’t know that one thought they were particularly
      going to be the hubs of any great new businesses. It’s interesting if that legislation, which I had
      never really thought about for a second, made a .. It’s a good case study in how the unanticipated
      consequences, maybe they were anticipated, I don’t know, but I don’t imagine they really were, when
      they thought, “Well, people should get a little more of the benefits of this research,” and then it
      leads to the MIT area, which was a dump certainly, becoming a huge boom area. This wasn’t urban. I
      guess what I’m trying to say is, this wasn’t an act of urban policy. It was an act of, I don’t know
      what it was, of letting people monetize their research.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Yeah. I think there was no question that they thought of it as economic policy as well. I think they
      thought that it was going to help American growth. I don’t think anyone thought about the urban
      implications of this, that part of it. And you’re right, MIT is Boston’s land grant college. So it’s
      the classic example. And there’s no question it has been an economic engine for this region in a
      big, big way.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s interesting. And immigration, just while we’re on of my favorite hobbyhorses of our
      foolish policies, from the point of view of what you study, I take it the cities could use and
      welcome lots more immigrants of, well, I won’t put words in your mouth, you tell me.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And should they be all the PhDs who are being sent back, or could they also be people who want to
      work hard and start off in restaurants?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      I think immigrants are good for cities and cities are good for immigrants. I think both of these
      things are true. They’re traditional ports of entry into the US, urban services benefit from having
      immigrants who may be working but they may end up being entrepreneurs in ethnic products. That’s
      also a thing which makes cities rich, is having a great cultural landscape, a kaleidoscope of
      different cuisines. So I think having a more permissive immigration policy would be fantastic. And I
      agree with you, it’s both at the top end of the skill distribution, but I would do a lot more at the
      low end as well. And I also am just keenly aware of the incredible privilege of being an American.
      And just some part of me makes me uncomfortable when I shave my face in the mirror of thinking that
      I really want to fundamentally deny that privilege to another person. My father came to New York in
      ’64 from Germany, and I wouldn’t exist if we didn’t allow in immigrants.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right. No, that’s right. And of course life’s unfair and some people don’t get to grow up as
      Americans, but if those who really want to come here go through the hoops properly to do so and are
      willing to work hard, it does seem like more, one would hope, would be better than fewer. And
      certainly now we do have, if you think it is probably hurting, just in terms of surfaces, the labor
      shortage, which really is an immigrant shortage to a surprising degree, I think. People haven’t
      really focused on five years of no immigration, partly because of policies and partly because of
      COVID. Makes a big dent, right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      You really see it in the leisure hospitality data. Over the last two years we’ve had first a huge
      decline in employment, then a modest comeback, and wages are way up in leisure and hospitality,
      which tells you that we have a real labor supply shortage in this area. And that’s in blue states in
      particular. In red states actually there’s been less of that, in general there’s been less of a
      great resignation in red states than in blue states. And immigrants tend to be disproportionately in
      those industries in blue state cities like New York.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Since you’re an actual real economist in addition to being a specialist in these particular areas,
      as you mentioned the great resignation, I can’t resist asking you about that since everyone talks
      about it. What’s your take on the whole question of, what is that really about? Is it temporary? Is
      it bad? Is it good actually? Why should people who are 62 years old go back to work for three more
      years?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      They may not ever go back to work. I think there has been two phenomena which are often merged
      together. One of which is just the fact that people didn’t want to work because of COVID fears in
      many cases. That’s probably one of the reasons why the blue state where COVID fears were much
      greater than in red states. And also there was a lot of federal money sloshing around the system
      that meant that people weren’t broke. Those feel like largely temporary factors. That doesn’t mean
      that the 62-year-old is necessarily going to go back to work. But it does mean that most of the
      35-year-olds are. But I want to put this in a larger 55-year perspective. So when I was born, only
      5% of prime aged males were jobless. And of course, prime age is the census definition, which is 25
      to 54, which as a 55-year-old I take great offense at.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s terrible. Right.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      But 5% were jobless. Over the past decade more than 15% of prime aged men have been jobless, that’s
      a tripling. And it’s not something that’s spatially neutral. It’s actually not a particular urban
      phenomenon. In fact, cities are relatively good at providing jobs for less skilled Americans,
      particularly in industries like leisure and hospitality. It’s particularly a phenomenon of America’s
      eastern heartland, a belt of states that begin down in Louisiana and Mississippi, run up through
      Appalachia, and ends up in the cities of the Rust Belt. I tend to think that long-term joblessness
      is much, much worse than working and entering lower wages. I think there’s good data that backs that
      up. If you look at the happiness data, if you look at suicide data… Long-term joblessness,
      especially for men, is associated with really bad outcomes. And I think this is, in some sense prior
      to COVID I was very clear that I thought that this was America’s largest unsolved social problem,
      and that has not gone away because of COVID. And typically what happens is you have an increase in
      joblessness during a downturn and then a partial comeback during the recovery. And I think this is
      something that we should be worried a lot about, is how to make sure that more of our adults are
      able to get the things that you get from work, which are not just earning a paycheck, but social
      connections and a sense of purpose. And all the UBI in the world, all the universal basic income in
      the world will do nothing to give people a sense of purpose and nothing to give them a sense of
      social connection that you get from a job. And I understand there are a lot of tech entrepreneurs
      who have a story about how their uncle gave them a chunk of money and that gave them the freedom to
      start their startup and now they’re worth $3.5 billion dollars. That’s like two guys, okay? The
      normal human beings, when you give them extra money, as we learn from the negative income tax
      experiments in the 1970s, work less. And that typically means they watch more television unless
      they’re younger, in which case they do more gaming. So this is not a recipe for economic dynamism,
      and it does feel like it’s a recipe for just exacerbating this problem of, millions of Americans
      were detached from the workplace, detached from other human beings, living lives of misery.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I guess the case for work is a mini version of the case for cities. There are these, as it were,
      positive externalities, both for the individuals themselves in terms of family life and self-respect
      and opportunities to learn new things, and also for the surrounding areas. It’s not just a matter of
      you could plausibly through UBI replicate in some macro economic way, you could, they could continue
      to buy food and have medical care and so forth. Yeah.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Most of us from working bring benefits to other people that are not entirely monetized for
      ourselves. So that’s one element to it. We also bring benefits because we pay taxes and we don’t
      consume public benefits. There’s even the thing that roughly about 35% of long-term jobless men live
      on their parents’ couches, live with their parents. And so in some sense the parents, most of those
      parents did not get to be consulted when that person quit their job. And so in some sense you’re
      helping the parents out as well by being pro-work.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      Yeah, that’s good for that. Let’s talk about housing policy as we, last 10, 15 minutes here, since
      that seems to be one of the key, you’ve mentioned crime and education. Those seem like very big
      policies, but on the more strictly economic side, I guess, housing policy maybe is the biggest, I
      don’t know, question mark over cities and just differentiator between cities, and NIMBY and YIMBY.
      It’s become a pretty live issue just in the last, I don’t know, few years, I feel like. It was a
      little bit obscure a few a decade ago when we had a financial crisis and everyone was thinking much
      more about, I don’t know, should the Feds keep zero interest rate policies forever? But how
      damaging, if they are damaging, are our economic policies, our housing policies? What’s the core
      mistake, if there is one? Are some cities much better than others, et cetera?

      So historically Americans have moved to places that are more productive. Historically that has been
      enabled by the fact that no one said that you couldn’t build a log cabin in Iowa in 1880 or put up
      whatever house you were going to put up there, or stop you from moving to Los Angeles in 1910.
      Typically, we have made it very easy for people to build housing in productive areas. Americans have
      moved to places that are more economically dynamic. Over the last 75 years, maybe even a hundred
      years, if you want to date it back to the single use zoning of the 1920s, so-called Euclidian
      zoning, we’ve made it easier and easier for neighborhoods and cities to say no to new housing. What
      wealthy people, what homeowners, what poor people often want to do, then, is to say no to change.
      Want to say no to neighborhood change. I think there’s both some economic logic to this, in the
      sense that to an average homeowner, housing affordability isn’t something to be wished for. Housing
      affordability means their most valuable asset just got less valuable. So why would you possibly want
      more affordable housing? Why would you possibly want to expand the housing supply? There’s also just
      the inconvenience of going through nearby construction. You don’t like that either. You’ve got two
      things which mean that you don’t want to have building. Plus there’s probably less rational aspects,
      which are, I just fear the change. There’s lots of evidence to suggest that human beings think that
      something bad is going to happen, and then their life is going to be incomparably worse. Yet we are
      a very adaptive species. At the end of the day, when you put up the new apartment complex at the end
      of the street, we’re still fine. It didn’t really make much of a difference in our lives. I think
      both things are going on. What has happened in community after community, starting typically in the
      more educated places— Jane Jacobs was an example of this. It started off typically saying no to
      public projects. The story is often told around Washington Square Park in New York. In fact, this
      appeared in Mrs. Maisel, it has Jane Jacobs objecting to change in Washington Square Park. Yet she
      was actually not the central player in that. She was actually, that’s where she got started, and
      then gradually moved on from blocking, running an expressway through Washington Square Park to
      blocking all forms of neighborhood change, like in historic preservation districts. This moved into
      the suburbs. In cities, it’s historic preservation. It’s the ideology of NIMBYism. In the suburbs,
      it’s some alleged form of environmentalism. Think about the Save the Bay Foundation, which grew up
      around San Francisco in the 1960s. They are very much against things which would imperil the local
      environment. Now, the problem with that from a pure environmental perspective, is you need to think
      about the global environment as well as the local environment. It turns out that building in greater
      San Francisco is one of the greenest things you could do in America, from a global carbon emissions
      thing, because this is an area with very moderate weather, so you need to heat very little and cool
      very little, and you have lots of access to public transportation. If environmentalists in San
      Francisco really want to do good things for the environment, they should be saying, “Don’t develop
      in Las Vegas, develop here. We’re going to fast track all the high rise buildings you want to make.”
      Yet of course, that doesn’t happen. What this means is that the sort of highly educated, highly
      successful hubs, like San Francisco, like Silicon Valley, like Los Angeles, like New York have been
      the places where people figured out first, how to stop new construction. And so you’ve frozen their
      housing supplies in amber— Middlesex County, where I am in Massachusetts, is another example. And so
      people can’t afford to move in when these places become more productive. This has led to an America
      that’s much less dynamic, an America that’s much less efficient, because we’ve created these housing
      frictions that make it impossible to adjust to changing economic circumstances.

      I suppose it’s a political matter. How does one overcome that? One would have to have either states
      come in and impose knockdown restrictions at the local level, or certain localities would have to
      decide that it’s ultimately hurting them? I don’t know.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Localities will never decide. You can never get to a case in which you’ll get particularly suburban
      homeowners communities to agree to lots of extra development. Even if you think that there’s some
      sort of a bargain here, where the developers could agree to give enough money to all the existing
      homeowners, I just can’t see a way in which American democracy is rigged up to manage a deal of that
      complexity. The natural way to change is at the state legislature level. There are states can either
      take away zoning power from locality. For example, Chapter 40B in Massachusetts provides a get out
      of jail free card for developers, if the community basically has no affordable housing, and if the
      builder wants to build with enough affordable units. That creates a way around. You also can
      incentivize localities to create more housing. I was quite keen on trying to bid into the
      infrastructure bill, the idea that we’re not going to spend infrastructure dollars on places that
      can’t build to take advantage of that infrastructure. I thought there was some claim that there was
      going to be a legal problem with that. I can’t see what legal system would say that we’re not going
      to embed cost benefit analysis in our infrastructure. You get more bang for your buck with
      infrastructure if you’re in your place that allows building. It just makes more sense if you’re
      building in Texas and you know they’re going to be able to build a whole new community around it.
      You’re going to get a lot more for this infrastructure than you will if you build in San Francisco.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I suppose ultimately, markets should take care of this in some way, because the place that’s
      cleverly keeping everyone out at some point becomes, I don’t know, not so desirable, because this
      doesn’t have the most modern amenities. I’m trying to think why. There are some ways in which, and
      businesses move away because they can’t attract workers because it’s too expensive. And suddenly
      Silicon—but people have been saying this for a long time—and Silicon Valley is still Silicon Valley.
      Maybe some businesses aren’t, well, Austin, I suppose there are some examples where the market
      gradually has an effect of punishing this kind of behavior.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      It does. It doesn’t actually, the thing is, before Silicon Valley really starts to suffer, it gets
      cheaper. It hasn’t yet, but if it’s starting to suffer, it gets cheaper and then people can afford
      living again. The way that America has handled this for most of the last 50 years is people have
      gone to Texas. We’ve had escape valves, as you say. That’s, in some sense, eased the pressure. That,
      of course, does not from a national perspective, having building in or businesses growing in places
      that are easy to build in, rather than places that are currently productive, that doesn’t create
      costs. We are better off if we locate in a place that is currently most productive in lots of ways,
      but you’re right. The less regulated parts of America have been the escape valve. It’s a good thing
      we have that escape valve.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I suppose, as you say, it might be ultimately slightly less, more efficient in a way to be building
      where there’s already the good workforce, but you could argue from a national point of view, it’s
      not such a bad thing to have the exit to places that have heretofore been underdeveloped. It’s been
      good for the south to have all these auto plants with high paid jobs. It’s bad for Detroit, but on
      the other hand, the exit strategy, so to speak, does benefit poor areas, and gives new people
      opportunities and so forth, I guess. Right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      That’s right. I believe in competition among firms and I believe in competition among localities as
      well. I think there’s something very healthy in America that you have this sort of constant
      competition among places. This actually takes us back to Mancur Olson, who you mentioned.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. I was just going to end with asking you to say a word about Mancur Olson, who I feel like was
      a big deal when I was in grad school, I guess it might have been, late seventies, and as a young
      professor, and maybe he still is, I don’t have the sense people cite it as much. Say what the core
      argument of the book is, and why you decided to write a new introduction and so forth.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      The core argument of the book is in stable societies you have coalitions, rent seeking groups, to
      use one of those phrases, that arise, which basically figure out how to use the tools of government
      to restrict competition and protect what they’ve got. This eventually leads to slower growth and the
      decline of nations. You have the rise of nations, and then you create this sort of stable prosperity
      that leads to all these coalitional groups that then stymie future growth, stymie future
      entrepreneurship.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Stymie innovation, change…
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. They’re protecting the status quo. Now, I read this book, I read this book later than
      you did. I read this book in 1990, rather than in 1980. ‘ Cause I read it in graduate school as
      well, rather, which is eight years after it was written. To me, that sounded like, okay, maybe that
      was the New York of the 1970s and 1980s, maybe, but it didn’t feel like Reagan’s America to me. It
      felt like there was lots of good stuff happening in Texas and other free places, which maybe you had
      some places that were mired in this regulation, but other places were not. I would say 30 years
      later, I think Olson’s a seer. I think he not only identified an important channel that exists in
      many places. He actually told a story of America, as we’ve seen more and more communities embrace
      this type of regulation on housing, which is a classic example of existing homeowners protecting
      what’s theirs by stopping change, by stopping growth, by stopping innovation, but also occupational
      licensing, the proliferation of rules, it’s stymieing entrepreneurship. You raise the issue of
      immigrant entrepreneurs and cities. I think it’s a national embarrassment that we regulate the
      entrepreneurship of the poor so much more strictly than we regulate the entrepreneurship of the
      rich. If you are some Harvard College student who wants to start your internet phenomenon in your
      Harvard College dorm, you can have a billion users before there’s a regulator that knows you exist.
      If you want to start a grocery store that sells milk products six blocks away, you’ve got 15 permits
      to get through. The less educated tend to innovate in real space as opposed to cyber space. That
      just makes it much more difficult to evade the regulations. This is, again, a sort of quintessential
      example where most of those regulations do very little good. They do protect insiders from
      competition. For example, one of my pet causes on this was freeing the food truck. I love food
      trucks. I’ve eaten in food trucks outside of my office for the last 30 years. I think it’s a great
      form of urban entrepreneurship, yet it’s one that’s regulated in city after city. I remember
      sometime 15 years ago, I was on an NPR show where there was some woman who had a food truck called
      the Pink Flamingo! It’s got an exclamation point after the O. She had been trying to start her food
      truck in Detroit for 18 months. They had the host, they had the woman, then the ombudsman of the
      city of Detroit on the NPR show. First of all, the fact that Detroit is saying no to any
      entrepreneur is just crazy. They should be welcoming anyone. The only constituency that doesn’t want
      food trucks in Detroit is just the existing restaurant terms. It’s just protecting the existing
      people. The priceless thing is at the end of the hour, after this poor city ombudsman has been
      beaten up by the woman, beaten up by me, beaten up by the host, beaten up by every caller. He says,
      “Look, lady, just go ahead and start your food truck. We’re never going to catch you,” which I
      thought was…
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I guess Olson’s book was later than I realized if it was early eighties. I guess he had written
      articles that people like me had read. It was sort of a theme almost of a certain type of social
      science, somewhat neo-conservative, you might say, but also on the left, I’d say, that the
      stagnation was a threat, and innovation was being stifled. Interest group liberalism, Ted Lowy, some
      of that stuff was similar to that. Everything was kind of, the whole New Deal structure had become
      so embedded and stuff. It’s funny. I was a tiny part of the Reagan administration—not in anything to
      do with economics— in education, but we all thought we were sort of fighting that. That was kind of
      the point of Reaganism, in some respects, supply side economics, entrepreneurship, innovation, lower
      taxes, the whole supply side was sort of a way of trying to get at that pro-immigration, NAFTA, pro-
      trade. I guess what you’re saying is that did not actually shape the next 30 years in major parts of
      policy though. Right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Well, we don’t know. It could have been much worse, Bill.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no I think that’s true. We do have Silicon Valley and stuff. I do think it’s interesting how
      much certain parts, which, sort of by accident, you might say, weren’t highly regulated. This very
      much fits with Olson’s thesis though, right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      If they weren’t existing people, there’s no existing person to block the internet, because there was
      nothing quite like it if you know what I mean. So they got to develop unimpeded, in a sense, whereas
      if you wanted to start a new auto company, or build high rise housing, as we’ve been saying, there
      were plenty, or start food trucks, there were plenty of established interest groups with their
      connections with the regulators and so forth, who were able to slow things down. Just generally
      closing on this, do you think it is a big problem today? Olson, it remains a sort of challenge to us
      as a nation.
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Absolutely. I think of it from my urban lens, but I think we need cities for outsiders. I think very
      much what we’ve had increasingly are cities that are geared around the existing incumbents within
      the city, whether they’re homeowners or restaurateurs, or teachers unions. Teachers, which are, this
      is a quintessential example, the teachers unions get protected, but the people who bear the cost are
      the kids of poor families. We need to have cities that are for outsiders, whether or not, and we
      need a nation that’s for outsiders. The founding document is fundamentally about making this not
      just a country for people who have what’s theirs. That, to me, means taking on the threats that
      Olson identified 40 years ago, and fighting, continuing to fight hard as you did in the 1980s.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. I hope we did a little good. One problem today, I suppose, is politically each party in its
      own slightly odd way is not really on board this pro-innovation, pro-growth, pro-openness globalism,
      to use the term, local versions of globalism, innovation kind of agenda. The left’s suspicious of
      the capitalist side of it, and the right’s suspicious of the innovative side of it. Right?
  - speaker: Ed Glaeser
    text: |
      Yeah. But ultimately, we’ve got to keep on fighting for this one. We’ve got to keep on fighting for
      freedom and the ability to innovate.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. I’m totally with you. Well, we’ll have to have another conversation actually in about the
      somewhat interesting aspects to this way of thinking about the economy and about the society,
      really, that I’d love to continue this conversation. Ed, thank you so much for taking the time
      today. People should go out and read The Triumph of the City , and The Survival of the City , and
      the new edition of Olson’s book, which you have the preface to, and that’s out just next month, is
      that right? September 2022. That’s great. So Ed, thank you for taking the time today.
