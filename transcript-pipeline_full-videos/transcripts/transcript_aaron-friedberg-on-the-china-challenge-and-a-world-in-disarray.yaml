      Hi, I’m Bill Kristol. Welcome back to Conversations . I’m very pleased to be joined again I think
      for the sixth time, amazingly, by my old friend, Aaron Friedberg, a very distinguished professor of
      politics at Princeton University for quite a long time now. Served in the White House and in the
      federal government. Done a lot of work with the Defense Department and other parts of the US
      government, so real practical experience as well as superb academic credentials. One of the leading
      China experts who’s been right about China when so many of your fellow China experts were wrong and
      thinking it was all going to work out fine, and you wrote a whole book about how they were
      predicting they were going to be wrong, and they are wrong. Has that made you popular in that
      community, Aaron?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, you said, “My fellow China experts.” The real China experts don’t consider me a China expert.
      So I’m out of that fraternity, which is a certain advantage.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I bet that’s right. You do serve on the congressionally mandated US-China Economic and Security
      Review Commission, which is a distinguished bipartisan commission which studies US-China
      relationships. So you’re in the middle of that with members of Congress and dealing with the
      administration as well. So great to have you here. What a time. We had a conversation in March and
      focused on China, but we’ll talk quite a bit about Russia-Ukraine and how China’s interested in that
      and how they might have an interest in a frozen conflict there. And I thought the world’s getting
      awfully complicated. We have this medium and long-term threat from China. We’ve got Taiwan. We have
      Russia, Putin having launched the largest ground war in Europe in 80 years. And now we have a major
      conflict, to say the least, in the Middle East with Israel and Hamas. We have the Houthis doing
      their thing in the Gulf. We have Taiwanese elections just last weekend. We’re speaking, what is it,
      January 18th. So what is going on? Just begin with the world situation and then we’ll get more into
      China. But, am I wrong to think this is not quite something we’ve seen in a long time?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      I can’t think of a period in recent history that’s the equivalent of this, at least in terms of its
      complexity and the multiplicity of major conflicts, either ongoing or potential. You mentioned we
      spoke a year ago, and at that point we were talking all about Russia-Ukraine and that was greatly
      complicating the picture, and now we’ve got this additional dimension. So it’s really a three-sided
      or three sets of confrontations, two of which are violent, and the other China and Taiwan is not, at
      least not yet. And the United States kind of standing back at one remove supporting others who are
      being opposed by forces that are backed ultimately by China, but also by Russia and Iran.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      I guess, how correct is it to say they’re not just overlapping, but interlocking conflicts? Or how
      much is it these are three different things, and we deal with them as we deal with them?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      There are three different things, but I think they’re interlocking and the interests of the parties
      converge in various ways. I don’t think there’s a giant master conspiracy that set all these things
      in motion. But taken together, and I guess I’m thinking here particularly, I visualize this as sort
      of a triangle around the periphery of Eurasia. Where in Europe you had Russia-Ukraine. In Asia, you
      have this confrontation at least between China and Taiwan and potential armed conflict there. And
      now in the Middle East, this additional dimension, Israel-Hamas you mentioned, and then Israel-
      Hezbollah, Israel-Iran, and also the Houthis backed by the Iranians who are making a lot of trouble
      and disrupting global shipping. Who knew? I think for many people it’s a surprise, the extent to
      which they have sophisticated arms and are capable of doing a lot of damage. So it’s all around the
      clock. It’s those three confrontations or actual conflicts underway. The only one in which the US is
      now directly involved, at least for the moment, is with the Houthis on the Red Sea. But we’re
      supporting Ukraine, obviously we’re supporting Israel, and we’re supporting Taiwan. So we’re behind
      this and trying to support our friends who are trying to stand up to increasingly aggressive
      authoritarian powers.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, so let’s go through each of these, but let me begin in a way backwards, you might say, from
      the US point of view. I guess I have a feeling, and I say this as someone who’s been pretty
      supportive, quite supportive of the Biden administration and willing to cut them a break at times
      when it’s hard to deal with all these things at once and there are big surprises. But I have the
      feeling in the last month or two, and maybe I’m just overreacting to some of the Houthi headlines,
      that it doesn’t seem like we’re quite as much on top of dealing with these crises as we might be,
      that people might be losing some confidence in us around the world, that we might be losing some
      confidence in ourselves here at home. You’ve been around US politics, as well as international
      politics for a long time. What’s your sense of that? And again, I’m not even being judgmental. Maybe
      this is just the world we’re living in and Biden’s doing as well as one can be expected, but it just
      is objectively a more challenging world, but whatever fault could or couldn’t be ascribed. How
      worried are you about that, just the overall US credibility and standing?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      I am worried about it. I tend to agree with you. I’ve been inclined to give the current
      administration a break or actually to be supportive of many of the things they’re trying to do. I
      think at this point, it’s hard to believe that they’re not overloaded with all of this. I think
      we’ve probably talked about this in the past, but until I served in the government, I used to think
      this idea that the government can’t deal with more than one crisis at a time is just nonsense. We’re
      this great global power, we have to be able to do all these things at once. We fought a global war
      in the Second World War and so on. And yet, in reality, dealing with one of these situations is
      stressful. Dealing with several is extraordinarily stressful. Plus, whatever you think of what the
      administration is doing, whatever you think of what they’ve done in the past, they’re now under a
      lot of pressure, domestic political pressure. Certainly as regards Ukraine, this has become maybe
      the major partisan foreign policy issue between Republicans and Democrats, or at least some
      Republicans and Democrats, and is likely to feature, I think, in the upcoming election campaign. The
      administration is also under pressure in its support for Israel, particularly from the left side of
      the Democratic Party. And so that’s not a trivial thing for them to deal with, especially in the run
      up to presidential election. I think they’re also concerned, and one of the reasons I think that
      they’ve been as hesitant as they’ve been to respond to what the Houthis were doing or to confront
      the Iranians directly, which they’ve not wanted to do, is I think they’re just concerned about a
      conflict that escalates and produces economic dislocations that will further complicate their
      ability to win the upcoming presidential elections. So in reality, presidents are always concerned
      about domestic politics. And of course, this is a special election and they have a special reason to
      be concerned about it. The Taiwan issue is less urgent in a sense, but I think there are questions
      there about whether the administration is doing enough to support the Taiwanese. And one of the
      lines of criticism of what the administrations have been doing in Ukraine is that it’s arguably
      taken resources and focus away from Taiwan, which some in the Republican Party in particular say
      should be our principal concern. So, they’re dealing with these three crises or confrontations, and
      they’re also under increasing domestic political pressure. So, I don’t envy them.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And the possibility of Trump, we’ll certainly get to this a little later, being elected in
      2024 also complicates their life because it means foreign actors have different incentives, Putin to
      wait things out for this year, allies to be nervous and so forth. But let’s get back to that.
      There’s so much to cover. I don’t quite know where to begin. But let’s begin with Taiwan, which is
      the least kinetic, I would hope. We say this, and of course we release this conversation tomorrow
      and God knows what could have happened, but let’s hope not. But they just had an election last
      weekend. The situation there is less dramatic, obviously, than Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas or the
      Houthis. But what happened in the Taiwanese election? What does it matter? And more broadly, how
      does China see things in their neighborhood and around the world, in your opinion, compared to maybe
      a year ago? A year ago, I think we had this conversation in March, you really stressed the degree to
      which China would like to have a frozen conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that would weaken us,
      make Russia maybe even more dependent on them going forward. But now other things have happened too.
      So give us the Taiwan issue and the Chinese point of view in general.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Okay, so starting with the Taiwan election last Saturday, as you mentioned, Taiwan had a
      presidential election. There were three parties, the DPP, which is the incumbent, the KMT or
      Kuomintang, which is their main opposition, and then a third, a new political party. So it was a
      three-way race. A couple of things to note about it, just struck in reading the accounts of the
      election. First of all, something like 70 plus percent of eligible voters voted in their election.
      You may have seen videos of the process by which the ballots were being counted. No one raised any
      questions about the validity of the outcome, even though obviously the parties that lost hoped that
      they would win. And by the time the sun rose here in the United States on Saturday morning, it was
      all over and the DPP had won. So just a reminder that Taiwan is an admirable democracy, and I think
      we have some things to learn from them. Their example is actually quite a positive one when you
      think about what we’ve been going through. So a successful election.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Some major issues between the parties, but nonetheless no claims that it was rigged or that they
      couldn’t abide by the results. Right? Or no serious claims.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      No. No serious claims. They had major issues, and a lot of the issues are domestic. So, I think we
      in the United States and other foreign observers tend to think of this as— we see it through the
      lens of Taiwan versus the PRC. And of course, that’s always an issue for Taiwan. But then there were
      all kinds of the usual sorts of domestic issues about employment and domestic policy and so on. And
      on that score, I guess the DPP took a lot of criticism and the newly elected or incoming president
      of the DPP got something like 40% of the total vote, whereas the outgoing president, President Tsai
      had gotten 50% when she ran. So there’s a degree of dissatisfaction with what the DPP is doing.
      People have said that if the two opposing parties had managed to get their act together, and they
      tried to form a unity ticket, but it fell apart. My understanding is in part because they couldn’t
      decide who was going to be at the top of the ticket. But maybe if they had done that, they would’ve
      won. Anyway, they didn’t. And yes, with all of those issues, and I should say also with a very
      concerted and ongoing effort on the part of the PRC to interfere in their election with
      disinformation, misinformation, propaganda, even with all of that, there was, as far as I’m aware,
      no challenge, no serious question raised about the validity of the election and about its outcome.
      So again, there’s some sort of civic lessons to learn there because the degree of involvement and
      engagement on the part of their citizens, but also undoubtedly there are some lessons to be learned
      about how exactly to handle CCP disinformation efforts. Of course, it’s a different situation there
      than it would be elsewhere, would be in the United States, but nonetheless, this is a problem that
      everybody’s going to have to deal with. I haven’t followed this closely, but I’m sure I’ve seen
      references to fakes and videos and recordings and all kinds of things. So DPP won. Incoming
      president who won’t be inaugurated until May, so they have a long gap between the actual election
      and I guess as we used to do before the depression. And there’s a question we maybe can talk about
      that, about what kinds of things may happen in the interval. The incoming president, soon to be
      President Lai, has said that he will continue with the policies of his predecessor, which have been
      stiff in their resolve not to succumb to pressure from the CCP, but also they’ve gone out their way
      to avoid anything that could be interpreted as provocation, no talk of independence or anything of
      the sort. They’re also committed to making ongoing improvements in Taiwan’s military capabilities,
      to cooperating with us to do that and so on. So there’s likely to be continuity, at least in terms
      of foreign policy. From the perspective of the PRC, this is a significant setback. There’s no
      subtlety about what the CCP wanted. They did not want DPP to win. They would’ve preferred, I think,
      for the KMT to come back. And the KMT, although it’s moved away from its old posture of claiming
      that it was the legitimate ruler of all of China, has been, I think, softer and more accommodating
      in its approach to the mainland, even though they’re not saying, “We now support reunification”
      anytime soon. So they would’ve preferred the KMT, they’ve got the DPP, they’re going to have to deal
      with that, and they don’t like it. We don’t know exactly what they’re going to do. As I said, they
      tried a variety of things to make sure that this didn’t happen. I mentioned the disinformation.
      They’ve taken some steps that suggest that they might do things to constrict their economic
      relationship with Taiwan, which would hurt Taiwan, which does a great deal of business with the
      mainland, but would also potentially have a negative impact on China itself. So the X factor here,
      and the question I think that’s been on people’s minds is what else the CCP regime may do and how
      soon they might do it. We’ve been engaged in this country in a very intense, and I think in some
      respects, an exaggerated discussion over the supposedly imminent prospect of a major use of force by
      the mainland against Taiwan. This isn’t to say that it couldn’t happen, but I think we’ve kind of
      spun ourselves up in the last couple of years in talking about this to a point that may be
      exaggerated and unrealistic. But that said, there is little question, I think, that the PRC is going
      to continue to tighten the noose to the extent that it can around Taiwan. They’re doing this
      diplomatically. There are only, I think, 12 governments in the world remaining that recognize
      Taiwan, and that’s symbolic. Maybe it’s not of great practical significance, but one, Nehru dropped
      off, I guess there were 13, and now they’re at 12. Undoubtedly, they did that at the instigation of
      the PRC. Maybe that doesn’t make a huge difference, but it’s part of an ongoing effort that the PRC
      is making to limit Taiwan’s diplomatic space. I mentioned the economic pressure, and they’re
      continuing to put military pressure on Taiwan, both in the longer term, the ongoing military
      buildup, which is very serious. And every day that goes by, China’s capabilities against Taiwan are
      growing, but also displays of force. People, I think, are waiting to see whether the mainland will
      respond to the outcome of the election with anything that resembles what they did when former
      Speaker Pelosi visited Taiwan, I guess, in August, 2022. And they may yet do things like that.
      During the course of the election campaign, I think even while the election was underway, apparently
      they floated some of these surveillance balloons across Taiwan. There’ve been suggestions that they
      will take some further steps like penetrating Taiwan’s airspace and overlying the island, this kind
      of thing. So people are waiting, I think, to see what the PRC will do. I guess my own view is the
      likelihood in the near term that the mainland is going to start a war with Taiwan is very, very
      small. And I think that’s probably going to be true for at least in the short to medium term. I just
      don’t see this happening immediately. There are things that could happen that could be worse and
      more difficult to deal with than what we’ve had to face thus far and could be more serious than a
      replay of these big military exercises. And the thing that I think the more serious commentators
      have focused on in the last year and more is the possibility of a naval blockade that would
      effectively cut Taiwan off from the world and have major economic implications. Of course, a
      blockade is an act of war, so they probably wouldn’t do it overtly, but maybe they’re going to
      conduct exercises and they’re going to issue warnings to ships coming through sea lanes and so on. I
      don’t think a blockade is coming anytime soon, but I think we’re in for continued tension and
      increased pressure from the mainland on Taiwan. So, this pot is, it’s bubbling and it’s, I think,
      not going to boil over immediately, but the heat is going to go up, so it’s going to be even more of
      a concern.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      So it’s a defeat for the mainland that the DPP won as the least pro-succumbing-to-the-mainland party
      and quite resistant to it actually. That’s kind of their brand. But on the other hand, a defeat that
      they’re going to try to deal with. Not one that’s going to make them think, “Oh gee, I guess we have
      to give up on those prospects of unification with Taiwan.”
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yeah. And people have pointed out that there’s now divided government, so I believe the KMT has a
      majority in the legislative branch. So, there are going to be some constraints on what this new
      president can do, and undoubtedly the PRC is going to try to work on those and slow down Taiwan’s
      efforts to strengthen itself, in particular. The problem, I think, for China in the long run has
      been evident for a while, and this is just a reminder. And that is they really have lost any
      possibility of achieving, as they would put it, reunification in an uncoerced or peaceful way. For a
      long time, they did entertain the hope that they could do that. They thought maybe the KMT was the
      vehicle. But Taiwan has changed in the last 20 and 30 years, and more and more Taiwanese people
      think of themselves as Taiwanese first and not Chinese first. Support for unification or
      reunification has dropped off dramatically. I think the possibility of achieving a peaceful
      resolution of this on terms that would be acceptable to the mainland has disappeared. That doesn’t
      leave them with a lot of options other than the application of further pressure and hoping that
      somehow they can crack Taiwan’s resolve. The other thing I think the mainland would like to do, and
      this may be increasingly the focus of their efforts, is to chip away at the support that the United
      States has been giving and is giving to Taiwan. They have not been successful in this regard either,
      but I think the way in which they might do that is not to persuade us to back away and let China do
      what it wants, but rather to increase concerns in the United States, in the West, that war is
      imminent and that if we don’t do something to pressure the Taiwanese, who knows what’s going to
      happen? And that’s been the tone of things that the mainland has been saying for some time and
      they’re going to try to keep working on that, I think. Weaken support from the United States, make
      the Taiwanese feel at some point that they’re totally isolated, alone, and have no alternative but
      to agree to terms with the mainland. But they’re a long way from that, and certainly now, and in
      fact they’re probably further from that than they’ve been in a long time.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Maybe closer to getting this… They would be in favor of this. I’m not saying they’re the main cause
      of this but getting Americans to generally be weary of foreign entanglements and commitments and
      feeling overstretched and these things don’t work out perfectly. And people started saying recently
      on the right, the right-wing critics of Ukraine, “It’s another Afghanistan.” For now they’re anti-
      China for various reasons, and therefore pro-Taiwan, that’s orthodoxy on the Republican right. But
      how long does that last if we’re really tired? Or how serious and deep is that if we’re tired of
      deploying forces everywhere and spending too much on defense and so forth? I think all these… it’s
      funny how… I mean, I suppose we should go through these different parts of the world first, but we
      could talk about it for a minute now. I mean, the degree to which all these countries’ agendas
      depend on weakening US resolve in general, I think is underappreciated here. It’s not so much that
      China has to change our view of China necessarily or of Taiwan. But China has a big interest in
      changing our view of the US role in the world.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes, absolutely. And that I think is among the most important reasons why China is supportive of
      what Russia is doing, very much so. Also, they’re supportive of the Iranians, and in my view, they
      weren’t unhappy to see this war in Ukraine drag on. They may not have instigated it, maybe they were
      surprised by it, initially they may have been concerned about it, but I think they’ve come to the
      conclusion that it serves their interest in part for just the reason that you say, it wears us down,
      it certainly deflects our attention, some of it, from the Indo-Pacific region, and it contributes to
      these divisions that are emerging in this country over foreign policy in a way that we haven’t seen
      in some years. The same thing is true arguably of what’s been going on in the Middle East. I don’t
      think there’s any reason to think that China was in any way directly involved in what happened on
      October 7th, no suggestion of that. Or even that they’re directly implicated in what the Houthis are
      doing. They don’t have complete control over the Iranians certainly. But what Iran is doing in the
      region by confronting Israel both directly and indirectly through these three proxy groups, Hamas,
      Hezbollah, and the Houthis, and confronting us, again, divides our attention, divides our resources,
      stokes debate in this country over the particulars of this conflict, but also I think over the
      question of our position in the world. So, yes, I agree. I don’t think — certainly Russia, not China
      and not Iran — they don’t have any hopes of directly confronting us at this point or defeating us in
      some way. But they have reason to hope that our resolve is waning and that our resources are
      overtaxed. That’s the only way that they can succeed in achieving their objectives, is if the US
      pulls back from the support of its local allies and friends who stand in the way of their achieving
      at least their regional objectives. That’s true for Iran, it’s true for Russia, it’s true for China
      too.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Let’s take a moment on each of the Middle East and then on Ukraine, because it is in a way… You said
      your fellow China experts don’t consider you a China expert, but maybe the China experts don’t think
      enough about this broader context, which is really important to understanding, I suspect, what
      China’s thinking and the future of US-China relations. So the Middle East — I mean you’re an
      international relations expert, also China expert — so just generally, I mean October 7th is now
      what? Over three months ago. I mean, surprises, things to look for in the next few months that might
      happen or might not happen? Indicators that it’s going to really become a wider war and really have
      to be even more of a focus for us or that maybe we’ve seen most of it and it’s winding down a bit.
      Where are you on that?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, I’m not a Middle East specialist, so I’m even more reluctant to poach on the turf of people
      who really are. But I mean, first to start with the obvious point, what happened on October 7th was
      a shock and a surprise to Israel, the people who were most immediately concerned, and to us too. My
      sense is that the purpose of this attack was to provoke Israel into doing things that would leave it
      further isolated from the rest of the world and maybe draw in the Iranians or draw in Hezbollah to
      support Hamas. They appear, if that’s what they were hoping, on the one hand, I think they have
      succeeded in provoking Israel and causing Israel to become further isolated in the world. Also,
      they’ve succeeded, although I don’t know that they were intending this, in producing new and maybe
      serious tensions in the relationship between Israel and the United States. I don’t think they are
      likely to succeed in sparking a wider war, at least the way things have been going from what one can
      gather, if Hamas thought that Hezbollah was going to help them out by starting a war with Israel in
      the north, in Lebanon, they must have been disappointed because Hezbollah is pretty clearly not
      interested in doing that. If they thought the Iranians were somehow going to come in and help them
      out directly, they’ve been disappointed there as well. I saw an account recently, I think it was in
      the Wall Street Journal saying… recounting, who knows how reliably, a meeting between Hamas
      representatives and Iranian representatives in which supposedly the Iranians said, “Look, you didn’t
      tell us about this. Don’t expect us to do anything big to help you out.” Now maybe the Iranians are
      spreading that story because they don’t want to be implicated in what happened and they certainly
      have indirect responsibility because they’ve given support to Hamas over the years. But at least for
      the moment, the prospects of a wider war don’t seem to be there, at least not with Gaza as the
      spark, if you like. The piece of this that now has emerged, and which I think has also been a
      surprise even to many of the regional specialists, is what the Houthis are doing ostensibly in
      support of Hamas, but they have their own reasons for wanting to deflect their population from the
      fact that they the Houthis are now in charge, need to go from being a resistance movement to
      actually governing the place. And that’s not an easy task and they may not be very interested in it.
      So standing up to the United States may make good sense. It also presents them to the world as the
      great supporter of the Palestinians, and arguably as an embarrassment to Arab governments who are
      not stepping up to do that. I think the surprise for many people, maybe I should say it was a
      surprise to me, is the extent to which the Houthis have been armed by the Iranians with a suite of
      anti-ship missiles of various kinds and varying ranges including cruise missiles and evidently some
      ballistic missiles as well, which because of the geography and the relatively narrow waters that
      flow by the coasts and then have to go into the Suez Canal, enable them to interdict shipping to
      attack or if not to sink any major freighters or oil tankers to seriously disrupt maritime traffic.
      Because once these missiles start flying, the people who are sending the cargo via this route are
      confronted almost immediately with sky-high insurance rates, so they prefer to divert the shipping
      around the Horn of Africa if they’re going to Europe and that raises the cost. They’re able to cause
      a lot of mischief and I think no one that I’ve seen who knows anything has suggested that Houthis
      are suddenly a very sophisticated fighting force. But I think what it shows is that these fairly
      sophisticated and effective precision-guided munitions don’t require a very sophisticated military,
      highly trained, or with lots of other apparatus to use them and to cause a lot of disruption. That’s
      a new wrinkle in this. I think the Biden administration, it can be faulted for their, perhaps,
      misguided attempts to put relations with the Iranians back on even keel, and they may have believed
      that the situation in Yemen was quieting down. And they have tried, I think, as hard as they could,
      not to get directly involved in this, but now because of the repeated attacks on shipping, the US in
      combination with the British and other allies have had to launch some air attacks against some of
      the facilities from which these missiles are launched. But I don’t think anybody believes that is
      going to solve the problem, in part because apparently the Houthis have a pretty sizable arsenal of
      these things, it’s rough terrain, these missiles are mobile on mobile launchers. I saw one estimate
      that said, “Well, the strikes destroyed 90% of the targets at which they were directed,” but even if
      they did that, they destroyed less than a quarter of what’s thought to be the arsenal of these
      missiles that the Houthis have. Here, I think they’re the prospects for further escalation because I
      think we’re now in a kind of a tit-for-tat where the US coalition are going to be striking at these
      weapons and the Houthis are not going to stop. But again, I don’t see the Iranians becoming directly
      involved in this. The Iranians benefit from what their clients, if you like, these three groupings
      are doing, to attack their enemies, particularly Israel, attack the United States without Iran
      getting directly involved in that. And China benefits from what Iran is doing, two steps removed for
      the same reason, because it ties us up in knots. It seems to me this is going to continue. Even if
      the fighting in Gaza winds down, I don’t see much prospect that there’s going to be a sudden
      peaceful resolution to all of that that’s satisfactory to Israel or anybody else. There too, I think
      we have at best an open sore, an open wound that’s going to continue to deflect our energy and
      attention away from other things.

      The Houthis thing is such a good reminder that these unanticipated things that happened, the unknown
      unknowns, not just the known unknowns, the war started — Hamas attacked October 7th — the war
      started almost immediately afterwards. And there were a lot of people intelligently weighed the
      balances of would Hezbollah get involved and how well could Israel fight this war and the tunnels of
      Gaza and what would the Israeli domestic situation be and all kinds of things, very important
      things. And those have been discussed and we’ve learned something. I bet you could look pretty hard
      in the cover in the… online and media on October 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and see a lot of talk
      about the Houthis. That’s not a criticism, that wasn’t the most important thing, but here we are.
      It’s a good example of how these things, people take advantage of situations. People act on their
      own, even if they don’t take advantage of situations, they become challenges, as you say. In a way,
      the Houthis, ironically is more of a direct challenge to us than Israel, Hamas, where we’re standing
      with Israel basically, and have concerns about obviously the civilian casualties in Gaza and the
      reconstruction of Gaza and so forth. But I don’t know, the Houthis thing does… yeah, it’s not
      resolved yet. And I don’t know, Eli Cohen had a pretty excellent piece, a pretty tough piece I would
      say, saying this tit-for-tat is not the way to handle this kind of thing. It just guarantees that it
      goes on. So, I suppose we could live with it, I suppose we could be having another conversation in
      four months and Houthis would be lobbying missiles and ships would be mostly still going on the path
      they’re on, but some would be diverted around the Cape and, I don’t know, or not. Or do you think it
      has to be… I don’t know. What do you think, you think that’s the most likely situation as opposed to
      a cleaner resolution of this? And how much does it destabilize other things? The Saudis… I just want
      to, again, come back to the general chaos has some spillover effects even if there’s not a direct
      one-to-one correlation or something.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Right. A couple of thoughts, one is it’s just a reminder, and I guess what Hamas did in October in
      provoking Israelis was an illustration of this and maybe what the Houthis are doing now is another
      example. It’s so much easier to sow chaos and disruption than it is to assure stability. You don’t
      have to be a big and powerful force to do that, unfortunately. And both Hamas and its attacks on
      Israel and what the Houthis are doing now have proven that, they’re having global impact, even if
      it’s a somewhat indirect one. The other thing, you’ll excuse me for just one little excursion here,
      which is people have been talking about the revolution in military affairs for 20, 30 years. At the
      heart of that was the recognition that advances in, basically in microelectronics communications,
      guidance systems and so on, were enabling jumps in the accuracy of conventional weapons, precision-
      guided munitions that would have a profound impact on the character of war, one, so people have been
      saying that at least since the end of the Cold War. And two, some people at least, early on
      speculated that these same capabilities would ultimately proliferate, and it wouldn’t just be big
      powers that would have them, but because they’re relatively inexpensive, relatively simple to
      operate, even lesser states and even non-state actors could eventually get hold of these things and
      use them. And I think what we’ve been seeing since the start of war in Ukraine is that emergence of
      this revolution in warfare, in full flower, big powers, the United States, China, Russia, have been
      developing these things for a couple of decades, but now we’re seeing that even lesser powers can
      use them in very effective ways, and that is changing the character of warfare. That’s an
      illustration of this. As to what’s going to happen, I certainly don’t know. It is very difficult for
      me to imagine. Just looking at the Houthi part of this, from what I understand— is there going to be
      some negotiated settlement of this, or even if the war in Gaza simmers down, is that really going to
      cause the Houthis to stop doing what they’re doing? There are reasons to think not. Negotiated
      outcome, no. Are we going to invade Yemen and overthrow the Houthis regime? I think the probability
      of that is absolutely zero, less than zero for good reason. Are we going to be able to significantly
      degrade the Houthis’ capabilities to cause the kind of damage that they’re causing? I think the
      answer there could conceivably be: yes— at least in part, but it would require two things. One is
      this offensive element that we’re seeing, although thus far, only in limited increments, I guess
      we’ve carried out a third attack and we could keep on doing that. But the second piece of it has to
      be finding some way to interdict and prevent re-arming because the Houthis, as far as I’m aware,
      don’t have any capacity to manufacture these things. Maybe they can make some simpler rockets the
      way Hamas can, but not anything like the weapons that they’ve been using. So they have to get them
      from outside. Where do they get them? They get them from Iran. And how do they get there? They get
      there by sea. I guess there’ve been a couple instances in which we’ve stopped and inspected ships
      that are coming from Iran that have replacement parts and we’ve seized those. We could do more of
      that. We probably will do more of that. So we’re both attriting the existing forces, the Houthis are
      firing these things off so their magazines get lower. And then what can we do to prevent them from
      effectively rearming? I think we’re going to be trying to do that. We’re already starting. The last
      bit of that would be thinking about whether we can apply pressure to the Iranian regime in ways that
      would discourage them from continuing to do what they’ve been doing. They actually agreed under the
      terms of the… Whatever it’s called… It’s not exactly a treaty. Agreement that they signed with the
      Saudis a while ago that was brokered by China, agreed not to continue to supply the Houthis with
      weapons. Well, I would guess they probably never really intended to abide by that and now it seems
      to me unlikely that they would. So, what could we or outside forces do that would dissuade the
      Iranians from continuing to resupply? I think it’s going to have to be a combination of those
      measures to make these waters safely navigable.

      And as you said, having been in government, yeah, that’s a pretty major enterprise, all that, with
      Iranian implications and Middle Eastern implications, Saudis. And then you’ve got that and Ukraine
      and obviously the ongoing big threat of China and Asia. It’s a lot for any administration to deal
      with. I want to come back to that in a minute and ask you how you think they’re doing, basically.
      But I want to put a pin on your point that it’s so much easier. One thing we’ve learned over the
      last two years is it’s easier to sow chaos than to guarantee or secure stability. And I think that’s
      such an important point for people to just think hard about. The other point, as you started to say
      it, I actually went to a slightly different direction, I think, but consistent direction, which was
      the other thing about the last two years is surprises. If we had had the most intelligent
      conversation with all of our most well-informed friends, as well as some less well-informed ones and
      people with different points of view politically, I don’t know, would we have thought on December of
      2021, when Afghanistan was huge and bad and there were going to be implications of that we all
      thought? I think we were right about that incidentally, in terms of low point for the US and Putin
      saw it, but we didn’t expect, most people, a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February of 2024.
      We didn’t expect Hamas to be able to do what they did terribly on October 7th, 2023. I didn’t expect
      the Houthis to be doing what they’re doing. So this is only two years. That’s a lot of surprises in
      different parts of the world in two years and such a good reminder of… And I feel like together
      though… A, it’s a reminder of the nature of the world and the nature of life. But B, I do feel like
      they’re a little bit cumulative. We’re somehow in a moment now that began in November, maybe… Who
      knows when it began, but we’ll just say it began in February of… I said November. I meant February,
      began in February 2022. It’s now two years of conflict, surprises, reversals at times. Russia, look
      how pitiful their military is. Well, actually then they stabilized and aren’t quite as pitiful as we
      thought. Then it turns out they may be pitiful, but Hamas is may be stronger than Israel and we
      thought, and the Houthis could do more damage than we thought. So, which way does the military
      balance, which way does it cut? Are we stronger vis-a-vis our adversaries than we thought three
      years ago or weaker? Or is it some probably combination of the two? I mean, I feel like the degree
      to which historians will look back and say there was this period that began in February 2022, and as
      we’re in the middle of it or early in it, maybe is very uncertain in terms of its outcomes. And then
      the question is, how are we doing and how are our allies doing? And again, just one last point I
      want you to talk, not me, but Biden, everyone thought the administration… The early judgments, and I
      very much concurred in these after February 22, is we’re stronger than we expected, our allies are
      stronger than we expected, NATO is stronger than we expected, Ukraine did better than we expected.
      Could be a real moment for the democracies to really… And I think it was, and Zelensky was awfully
      impressive and Europeans were more willing to rally to Ukraine and so forth. US was pretty united
      despite the polarization of our politics. I feel a little different today, honestly. I think we did
      well and Europeans did well. But all in, if you now look around the world, are we as confident in
      our ability to manage these crises, our will to stick them out, our allies’ will? So I guess the
      question is: All in, what’s your judgment of US ability, the US policies, if we’ve done what we
      needed to do in different areas and what worries you the most, I guess going… Where are we almost
      two years after February 2022?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, let me just add one other surprise in there. And that is the economic difficulties that China
      has been experiencing and the fact that they have not bounced back from… Well, one surprise was they
      dropped their COVID policy literally overnight and went through a period when they evidently
      experienced very high number of deaths because they let the pandemic just burn itself through their
      population. And so, that was a surprise. The other thing that’s been surprising there was that their
      economic performance didn’t get a big upward boost as people thought that it would and they haven’t
      gone gotten back on a healthy trajectory of growth. They’ve had this ongoing crisis in their
      property sector, real estate, which has not caused the place to collapse, but is a serious drag on
      growth. So, they’ve been experiencing a negative crisis themselves and maybe we can come back to
      talk about that and what the implications of that may be. But there too, I don’t think many people
      were predicting that. In fact, the economists, I think, the ones that I have read, were predicting
      China… They’ve made an intelligent decision to drop their zero-COVID policies and get rid of these
      draconian lockdowns and try to get back to normal business. And as a result, their economy is going
      to get back on a healthy growth trajectory, and it hasn’t. And I think that’s also something of a
      surprise. But on your question about where do we stand, I shared the view that you expressed that
      what happened in February 2022 was, as terrible as it was, was also a tremendous opportunity for the
      United States, viewing it from our perspective, to further consolidate our alliance relationships in
      Europe, also in Asia. Among other things, it seemed to me that one of the unexpected effects of the
      Russian attack on Ukraine was to increase the level of seriousness in many places in Europe
      regarding the possible threat posed by China. And there really was a shift in the ways that people
      in many countries in Europe began to talk about China after the Russian invasion. And they began to
      use language that really sounded remarkably like that of some people in the United States saying,
      “The problem is the character of this regime, these dictatorial authoritarian regimes are inherently
      aggressive. They’re untrustworthy, they’re prone to begin conflicts and we need to take that
      seriously,” number one. Number two, the other thing that I think happened or began to happen more
      quickly was people in Europe started to take more seriously the concerns that had emerged,
      especially during the pandemic, but in our case had started somewhat earlier about deepening
      dependence on China for a variety of products. PPEs during the pandemic, but also semiconductors.
      All of a sudden, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but you find more people in Europe saying, we’ve
      learned from our experience with Russia that dependence on a hostile regime for essential inputs to
      our economy is risky and it can be cut off or it can be used to exert leverage over us. We don’t
      want to be in that situation again with respect to China or we don’t want to be with respect to
      China in the position we found ourselves in initially with respect to Russia. It seemed to me like
      there was a lot to work with. And also I should say in Asia, you also had heartening expressions of
      concern about what was happening in Europe and expressions of support for Ukraine and for NATO in
      the US in opposition to what was happening in Ukraine, and also in European capitals more concerned
      about Taiwan and more expressions of support for Taiwan and essentially support for policy similar
      to the one that the US has been supporting towards Taiwan. So, it was galvanizing. I wrote a piece,
      I guess it was published spring 2023, and it was entitled “A World of Blocs,” and spelling this out
      and saying there’s an axis of authoritarians that’s emerged and is consolidated, and now there’s a
      new possibility for creating a strong coalition of democracies in Europe, Asia, backed by the United
      States. I did a variant of that, a shorter one that was published sometime afterwards, which,
      displaying a lack of imagination, I called “A World of Blocs?” And the question mark there had to do
      not with the axis of authoritarians, which I think has really emerged as a bloc in a meaningful
      sense. But the question is more about us, and it has to do with our domestic politics… I mean, I
      don’t know about you, but I would not have expected that continuing support for Ukraine would’ve
      become such a controversial issue in our politics or that some parts of the Republican Party, not
      all of it, had become openly hostile to the Ukrainian government and more or less openly sympathetic
      to Russia. I kind of thought that was a Trump thing, which I think it was. But of course, because of
      Trump’s grip on the Republican Party, what’s his obsession becomes the obsession of many ambitious
      politicians on the Republican side. So our resolve not as strong as it was, because of course we
      didn’t anticipate what was going to happen in the Middle East and the controversy that would emerge
      over Israel’s response to this barbaric attack on them and the prospects that has opened for deeper
      divisions between us and our allies, particularly in Europe who have historically been less
      sympathetic to Israel than we are, but initially at least, took a line similar to ours in supporting
      Israel against this terrorist attack. So, there are fissures and seams there that… some of which
      were difficult to foresee. And of course, the other thing that hangs over this, it’s the elephant in
      the room, if that’s the right term, and that is the uncertainty over our upcoming presidential
      election. I think to a degree, which perhaps we don’t observe, maybe because people shield us from
      some of it, our allies have to be considering what the implications for them will be of a second
      Trump administration, and they have to be hedging against that possibility and waiting anxiously on
      the outcome of our election, because I don’t think most of them want to see that. So there too, I
      wouldn’t have expected as recently as two years ago that this was a serious possibility. And that
      too, I think has interfered with our ability to seize that moment and consolidate a stronger multi-
      part coalition. I think there are still possibilities there. I do think the current administration
      has been trying to push forward with the different pieces of that, but it has not progressed as far
      as I would’ve hoped two years ago. We have not taken full advantage of the opportunity that was
      presented two years ago.

      And that’s in defense spending and defense industrial base and some of the just basic building up of
      what we need for this new world we’re living in, right?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. And also, mobilization in the American public. I may have missed it, but I don’t think
      President Biden got on TV and gave a major fireside address in the immediate aftermath of the
      Russian invasion, saying, what he has, to his credit, said in other less visible settings, that this
      is a struggle between Democracy and Authoritarianism, and we in this country have to be the bulwark
      against authoritarian aggression. I mean, again, I think he has said these things, but not in a way
      that really gripped ordinary people as I think it might have. And we need to respond to it by doing
      some things that we would perhaps not otherwise choose to do, like undertaking major increases in
      defense spending. Seemed to me that there was a window, there was a moment after the Russian
      invasion when that would’ve been possible. People made this comparison, I think we did when we
      talked last year, to the North Korean attack on South Korea in June 1950, and the decision that the
      Truman administration made to ratchet up defense spending and to solidify NATO and so on. Different,
      undeniably, and maybe less intense. It was pretty intense, but maybe it was different than the
      Russian attack on Ukraine, but there was a model there for rallying the American people, and it
      seems to have passed, unfortunately.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Maybe it could be brought back. You and I have discussed this in the past, compared it to the early
      Cold War and the Truman administration and the possibility of a laying the [inaudible], imperfectly,
      obviously, for things that could… but beginning to do things that would pay off later and would lead
      to some stability and some ability to confront, certainly, the opponents. But the Trump thing is… I
      mean [inaudible], “Oh, you don’t like Trump, so you’re just saying this.” But of course it really
      isn’t just analytically so different that he’s going to, presumably, going to be the nominee again.
      I was thinking about it. Take the Trump, take the Truman example, just a very simple way. Roosevelt
      in ’44, and Truman in ’48 all ran against Republicans who defeated the isolationist wing of their
      party and therefore were more or less… I mean, certainly in the case of Willkie, very explicitly,
      Dewey ’44, a little more complicated, but basically there was no doubt we had to finish the war.
      People didn’t quite see the Cold War coming. And then ’48, very much so with Dewey against Taft, and
      then ’52 with Eisenhower defeating Taft. So, in the early Cold War years, the out party basically
      resolved — I mean there were all kinds of things going on, God knows —Joe McCarthy and Bricker and
      all this stuff, but ended up supporting the administration’s basic policy. So you had mostly
      bipartisan support for the basic policies that the administrations pushed and for all the criticisms
      and bickering. And if you think of the Cold War years in general, I guess you could say Goldwater in
      ’64, McGovern in ’72 were the two biggest challenges to the mostly bipartisan consensus. And they
      both got crushed in general elections, which restored the strength, that you might say, of the more
      or less bipartisan consensus, which was able to live through Watergate, therefore, and other things.
      I mean, it’s as if we do have Robert Taft as the nominee. From my point of view, it’s as if we have
      Robert Taft as the nominee in ’52 or really maybe Joe McCarthy as the nominee in ’52, if you want to
      think about it that way. Which incidentally, he wasn’t never thought of at the time, I think, as a
      real presidential possibility. He had a lot of fervent supporters. But of course, it’s a different
      world we live in, and Trump has been president, so he is a real possibility, obviously. I guess how
      much does that change the dynamics of everything, where Henry Wallace could not just a third- or
      fourth-party candidate, but a possible competitor to Truman in the Democratic Party in ’48 would’ve
      been another analogy, perhaps? I do feel that people underestimate a little bit, we went through all
      those fights here in the forties and fifties and afterwards. But this is so unusual in a way, but
      also challenging, therefore, to deal with this, which does mean, just to get back to your basic
      point, and maybe you could talk a little more about this, we’ll probably have to put off all the big
      talk, the interesting talk about the longer term challenge of China. We can have another
      conversation about that which we have had before, and which is presumably going to still be there
      three or four months from now. But just this next… What do we have, 10 months ’til the election is
      that right now? It’s January 18th, so a little less than 10 months ’til, and almost exactly a year
      until the inauguration. It’s January 18th, it’ll be January 20th, I think, 2025. So what a year,
      right? And to have this Trump presumably winning the nomination, what signal that sends abroad, what
      he then campaigns on, do Republicans in Congress make a deal on Ukraine as we talk? That’s
      literally, it’s very much up in the air right now with water discussions, and I just talked to
      someone on the hill, and they’re hoping it could work out in the next week, but if Trump wins New
      Hampshire and he says, “No, I don’t want a deal on the border or in Ukraine, ” what happens there?
      Obviously, the Middle East, we’ve been saying, we don’t know quite what direction that goes, whether
      it’s Israel, Hamas, or the Houthis. Taiwan, China has some interest probably in keeping that pot
      bubbling. I mean, I don’t know. Have we really looked at… Since we’ve been out of the real wars of
      the early 2000s and since Afghanistan simmered down to a very difficult, but still not a massive
      conflict after about 2012, 13, have we been in a situation like the one we seem likely to face here
      in 2024? It’s a real moment, isn’t it? And I don’t quite know what to say about it, but I want to
      hear what you have to say about it.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes, I think it’s potentially a fork in the road which we have not faced since the late 1940s, early
      1950s. That just as you say, certainly with Eisenhower’s election in 1952, where you resolve the
      question of whether there would be bipartisan support for this global US position, support for
      alliances and so on. Yeah, there were details to be worked out and there were disputes over various
      things, but there was a consensus, this Cold War consensus about confronting the Soviet Union,
      confronting China also working with allies in various parts of the world to accomplish the
      objectives of containment, and that held through to the end of the Cold War. And then the
      interesting thing, and maybe somewhat surprising to the theorists of international relations who
      assume that states are rationally calculating unitary actors that should logically at such a major
      turning point re-examine the assumptions underlying their grand strategies and adjust. That isn’t
      what happened. And we kind of ran on the fumes of that consensus through the ’90s, through the first
      decade of the 2000s, growing… there’s descent and disagreement about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan
      certainly, but that has now run its course. And we are now, I think, faced with a serious debate
      about whether we’re going to continue with anything resembling the set of policies that we adopted
      to conduct the Cold War. So, alliances, large and globally deployed military forces, free trade
      agreements, more or less binding us, the countries that shared our values. Are we going to do that?
      Are we going to continue to do that? And albeit in a very peculiar form, Trump has brought this
      issue to the fore, and I guess I’m of two minds on that. One, you could say it’s sort of a fluke. I
      mean its particular form is not something that one could have anticipated. And maybe if not for
      Trump, if you had had a more normal Republican as a candidate in 2016, or even as elected president
      in 2016, or if you had a more normal mainstream Republican now, whatever exactly that means, you
      would have disagreements, but not radical disagreements. I mean, think of how Rubio as a Republican
      nominee in 2016 would’ve run on foreign policy against Hillary Clinton. It would not have been this
      debate about fundamentals.

      Yeah. Or even Nikki Haley today, to take an actual candidate, the last one standing against Trump.
      She and Biden would be a more traditional kind of choice.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yeah. And you’ll know much more about this than I do. But there is in, at least on the Senate side
      among the Republicans, there’s kind of a core of people, not all of them old people who’ve been
      around for decades, but some of them, who basically still believe in this. Mitch McConnell being an
      example and who are critical of the administration on all sorts of things. But they continue to
      adhere to this basic view of the proper role for the United States in the world and maybe among some
      of the Republicans in the House. But that’s kind of a residual, I’m afraid, and it’s shrinking. I
      worry it shrinks with every passing year, partly because some of the people who make that up are
      exiting. And I don’t see a lot of new people coming in who want to pick up that banner and say, wait
      a minute, yes, we can criticize Biden for this and that, but we shouldn’t throw everything out and
      revert to isolationism basically. Or the way in which it’s presented now going back the early ’50s
      is this idea of Asia first, and we can talk about that. But nevertheless, this is because of Trump,
      I think, this is where we are. And so we have not faced anything like this and our allies have not
      faced anything like it either. And that has caused deep anxiety going back to 2016, which has been
      somewhat beneath the surface for the last three years because of Biden coming back. But I don’t
      think there are many serious people in our major allies who just assumed that it was all just going
      to be business as usual and the United States was back as Biden said, and things were going to
      continue as they had been before. There has been this anxiety in the background about whether the US
      is going to be around in the same way. And that, I think, is something that’s very different than
      anything that we’ve experienced or that our allies have since the early days of the Cold War.

      And what I’d add and want you to comment on finally is, but also in the actual 10 months or whatever
      it is till the election and 12 months till the inauguration, it’s a very turbulent world. So it’d be
      one thing if there was like, okay, it’s quiet. We get to have this fork in the road. We get to make
      a choice. We have a fork in the road. It’s coming in 10 months. Let’s have a debate about it. Our
      allies are so nervous, but okay, what can we do about that? But of course, a huge number of things
      are happening and could be happening, including some surprises of course, you just mentioned, few
      months. And with respect to Taiwan, they have sort of lame duck government now for a while. And then
      of course Russia, Ukraine, and obviously the Middle East. The degree to which we’re in extremely
      choppy waters with a very uncertain moment of decision ten months from now, I can’t really even
      think of a sort of example of that and of which of course the uncertainty about November is
      contributing to the choppiness of the waters today and giving incentives to certain actors to do
      certain things. So I mean in that respect, 2024 is not just like a year of division, a year of
      decision, though it is that, but also itself could be a very important year, don’t you think in
      foreign policy and international relations in terms of where we are just as a country by the end of
      this year, vis-a-vis the world situation in the global order? I mean, don’t you think or do you
      think and—
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … particular things to look for, are there things you’re sort of focused on and… there are
      elections, there’s Russia-Ukraine… what would you focus on? Where will we be in November ’24 I guess
      is what I’m asking?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Oh, Bill, if I could answer that question, I’d be—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Give a brief answer—
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      … In wealthy retirement.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      … we’ll end the conversation.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Well, of course, I don’t know. But yeah, it is I think potentially a fundamental turning point. I do
      think if Biden is reelected, we’ll continue along something resembling the current trajectory. And
      so maybe the idea that the United States has sort of returned to something more closely resembling
      the path that it was on before 2016 will sink in and people will start to believe it. Of course,
      that’ll depend on what happens in the Republican Party. And that’ll be a very interesting question.
      If Trump loses in the upcoming presidential election, what’s going to happen to the Republican Party
      and what’s going to happen to the Republican Party stance on foreign policy? I mean, I would’ve said
      once that if you took Trump out of the picture, things would snap back and maybe they would have if
      he had lost in 2016. But because he’s been successful, at least as far as he’s been, he’s now got
      people following him and coming along behind him. And to put it bluntly, coming up with pseudo-
      intellectual justifications for a lot of the things that he was doing on instinct or impulse
      disrespecting our European allies. So, you’ve got people saying, well, NATO has to do more, which of
      course they do, but that’s different from Trump saying, I’ll tear up the treaty and you’re on your
      own. That would’ve been, we would face a different prospect. We will face a different environment if
      he is defeated. On the other hand, if he wins and if he does a fraction of the things that he’s sort
      of intimated that he wants to do. First of all, I think it’ll produce even deeper divisions in our
      politics than we’re experiencing now and instability and disruption of a sort that we haven’t
      experienced on a sustained basis before. We went through some of this January 6th. But who knows
      what happens if he gets in. And that really is going to force everybody to recalibrate their
      thinking about the United States and about the role that we play. Of course, it’s exaggerated, and
      it’s led to some mistaken decisions to have this view as the United States as the indispensable
      power and so on. On the other hand, we are the poll in the tent that’s holding up anything
      resembling a stable international order, at least among… in the democratic parts of the world,
      democratic with a small D. And if that’s gone, I think we’re going to see a lot of chaos. I think
      we’re going to see a lot more conflict even than we’ve seen. Our allies are going to have to
      recalibrate and do various things, including potentially acquiring nuclear weapons of their own on
      the one hand. And on the other, what is that going to do to our opponents? And there’s not a simple
      answer to that. I think there’s reason to believe that Putin has been playing for this longer term
      with the hope that if Trump comes back, the pressure is going to be off him and support for Ukraine
      is going to be reduced if not eliminated, because I think our European friends would at least try to
      fill in if we were doing less. So there’s that. That’s going to change things. There’s the
      possibility that he might do things that Biden has been reluctant to do in the Middle East, using
      force perhaps in a more extensive way. And we don’t know where that would go, getting into a
      conflict directly with Iran. That’s not impossible. The interesting thing, and for me, the puzzling
      question is how does this look from a Chinese perspective? Because on the one hand, they have reason
      to think that Trump has inclinations towards them which are hostile. And he did set in motion a set
      of developments that have led us to a much more open rivalry with China than perhaps would’ve
      evolved if he hadn’t emerged. He did it in a kind of spasmodic and not very systematic way. And the
      Biden Administration has in many respects continued with the basic direction in which we were going,
      but actually made it more coherent and rational. So, would Trump pick up where he left off? Would he
      want to push even harder than the Biden Administration has done on trade issues, on technology
      control policy? He might. But would he be as interested in supporting Taiwan as the current
      Democratic administration has been? I mean, there’s some reason to have doubt about that. If you
      think about how Trump appears to make these calculations, what’s Taiwan done for us? They’ve stolen
      our technology, and we should be making these semiconductors. So, the other thing I think from a
      Chinese perspective is the prospect that deepening divisions within the United States and between
      the United States and its allies are very much in their interest. I think they are for reasons that
      maybe we’ll talk about next time around, they have significant problems of their own, but they also
      have still faith in their long-term prospects. And they’re convinced that our internal problems and
      divisions are greater than theirs and are going to prevent us from responding as effectively as we
      might to what they’re intending to do and what they have been doing. So would they rather see Trump
      elected in 2024 or not? I don’t know. In one sense, maybe it doesn’t matter to them. We’re all just
      sort of cogs in this big historical material machine that they believe in, but I think they would
      see a mix of pros and cons to a change from what they’re dealing with now.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Interesting. But just, I mean, final footnote really what you’re saying is I just worry also though
      about the next eight months themselves again, or 10 months. I mean, that is to say, what does the
      world look like in October of 2024? Are we confident Ukraine hangs on and is able to at least
      stabilize the situation, which itself isn’t great in a way, a frozen war without USA? Are we
      confident there will be USA? Are we confident about what happens in the Middle East? What about the
      Taiwan situation? So, the degree of just a very short-term instability in the middle of an election
      year with Trump as the probable nominee and everyone and him saying certain things, weighing in on
      everything presumably, which then affects the instability. I mean, I think people, we haven’t really
      gone through that either, honestly. And so, in a way, not really, I would say even in 2016 where
      people didn’t think Trump was going to win or 2020. And again, that was all before February 2022 and
      before October 7, 2023. So yeah, we’ll have a lot more to talk about even this year. And we probably
      should do so maybe around the conventions, let alone, I mean after this fork in the road gets chosen
      in November of 2024. But that was very interesting about China. Yeah, it’s really important to try
      to put oneself in their shoes as you have and think it through from their point of view. But there’s
      a lot to think about here, right?
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yeah. If you think about the three bad guys, if I can use that technical term that we’ve been
      talking about, Russians clearly all in with Trump, Iranians have to be concerned that he might be
      more forceful in confronting them. And the Chinese, I’m not sure. I think it’s a mixed bag from
      where they sit.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But I mean, how weaker we might seem in October of … Let’s assume Trump has a horrible campaign and
      is gonna lose by 10 points. I still personally think that we could be much weaker in October of 2024
      than we are today. I don’t think the trajectory is very good in terms of the Biden policies. And so,
      we could have, I would be for Biden against Trump and would still bet on that being better for the
      country over the medium and long term. But the degree to which we are just in very, as I say, choppy
      waters even now in terms of what’s happening in the next weeks and months and this year is also an
      added sort of complication to the situation.
  - speaker: Aaron Friedberg
    text: |
      Yes. And I think the biggest question mark, at least in my mind, is what is going to happen with
      support for Ukraine? Because if the Congress can’t get itself together and continue with the support
      that we’ve been offering, that’s going to make the situation, it’s going to change the situation
      there pretty dramatically and not in good ways. Could they lose? I don’t know. But they could be in
      much worse shape. And if that were to happen, what message does that send to the rest of the world
      about our, it’s not even about our resolve, it’s about the ability of our system as divided as it’s
      become to sustain policies over a period of time. That can’t be good. That’s only going to encourage
      those who want to further undermine and weaken the system that we built and to undermine and weaken
      us. And unfortunately, that prospect of a cessation of our support or a substantial reduction in our
      support for Ukraine seems to be a real one at this point. And as they used to say, the whole world
      is watching, and it’s not a very edifying picture right now.

      A sober, but I think a good important note to end on. So, we will end with that. We’ll come back in
      a few months and discuss both the world we’re in and also, again, the longer-term conversation about
      China. And there’s so much to talk about there in terms of trade policy, defense policy, defense
      industrial base, all that sort of stuff. But Aaron, thank you for taking the time today and for this
      really informative, I think if not entirely upbeat and cheerful conversation—
