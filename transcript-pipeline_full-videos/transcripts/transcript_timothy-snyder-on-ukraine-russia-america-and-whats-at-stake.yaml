      Hi, welcome back to Conversations . I’m Bill Kristol. I’m very pleased to be joined today by Tim
      Snyder, Professor of History at Yale, distinguished scholar of Ukraine, Russia, Central and Eastern
      Europe, author of the definitive work Bloodlands, and also author of more popular works on Russia
      and European History, and also on tyranny, freedom, and other big and important topics. Unlike many
      professors, Tim Snyder’s scholarly books are accessible to the rest of us, and his popular books are
      based on scholarship. So that’s a good combination. But just last week, what, your class on, what
      was it Hitler, Stalin and Us or something like that was disrupted at Yale, but you’ve survived that
      well. Anyway, Tim, thanks for joining me and let’s discuss Ukraine.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder

      Okay, glad to be with you. Let’s do it.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Let’s do it. So two years into the war, where do we stand in your judgment in terms of both the
      military situation and the broader geopolitical situation? And then we can go back and look a little
      bit at what happened before and then what might happen next.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Okay. I mean, I guess the military situation, there’s sort of the objective and the subjective side.
      I think subjectively, if you’re an American, and this right, there are sort of two problems. The
      first is that the Biden administration, although it generally in my view, has done the right thing
      and has made a number of adjustments and has been capable of rethinking, in 2022 when things were
      really critical and sensitive and when the tide of work could have been turned, we spent too much
      time making decisions and our decisions were based too often on what we thought wouldn’t make Putin
      nervous or they were based on virtue signaling like is this weapon system the right weapon system at
      the time? And let’s think about how good people will be if we supply it as opposed to what the
      Ukrainians actually needed to finish the war victoriously. The only way to really think about a war
      is how do you finish it victoriously? And then where we are now, of course, is that we’re not
      supplying anything. You know, Rheinmetall, one German company, is outproducing us in terms of
      artillery shells. The North Koreans are outlying the entire West, and we, for our own political
      reasons, which are unfortunately connected to Russia’s political reasons, are at the moment not
      doing anything at all for Ukraine. So that’s the subjective part and what I want to stress is that
      we’re the weak link. America is the weak link. The Russians see us as the weak link, and
      unfortunately, they’re correct. On the battlefield, the Ukrainians are doing, I would say
      surprisingly well. They’ve cleared out a huge swath of the Black Sea, of the Russia’s Black Sea
      fleet, which is allowing them to supply the near East and Africa with food. They’ve destroyed a huge
      number of Russian aircraft in the last few weeks, largely, if not entirely free in the sky. The
      Russians are on the offensive now, but it’s slow and it’s costing them. So this is still a war that
      Ukraine can win. But whether or not they win it depends upon whether they have allies who are
      capable of seeing the political stakes and capable of behaving in a way which is consistent with
      simple military logic, which is what do you need to do to help your ally to win.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And if we do finally get this aid package through and the Europeans continue to be, we can come back
      to this, I think in my judgment, better than they might’ve been standing up pretty well for Ukraine.
      You think this for now, it’s kind of, I don’t know if it’s really a frozen conflict technically, but
      it’s kind of not moving very much conflict on the main lines of battle, you think that’s sustainable
      for Ukraine for a while? I mean even if ultimately they could… one hopes they will win, but you’re
      not panicked about the current situation.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      No, I’m going to… Let me talk about frozen conflict for a second. Because frozen conflict, that’s a
      deliberate political aim. You go into part of Moldova, you freeze the conflict, and I would want to
      avoid that term because it suggests that nothing’s ever going to change. But also because it’s an
      aim in itself, like if we accept it’s a frozen conflict, then we say, “Oh, well then there’s kind of
      nothing we can do. It’s frozen.” So, it’s an active hot war. It’s a war of attrition in which you’re
      right—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      But isn’t it also, it’s a Russian aim in some conflicts, whereas here, their aim isn’t really a
      frozen conflict, is it?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, their aim as they make clear every day in the statements of their
      highest political authorities and their propaganda shows every evening, their aim is to destroy the
      Ukrainian state. I mean, for people who want to be fooled, there’s still stories out there about the
      Russian language or NATO or whatever, but what they tell us every day is they’re trying to destroy
      Ukrainian state and society. That’s their war aim. And so long as they haven’t done that, they’re
      going to try, they’re going to keep trying to do that on the Ukrainian side, yeah, they can sustain
      this for a long time, provided that they don’t engage in ill thought through offensive operations or
      lose too many people. The main constraint that they have is that there are only so many Ukrainians
      and it’s reasonable of them to be taking that constraint into account. Russia has more people, but
      also Russia, the Russian leadership doesn’t care at all about losing its own people, whereas
      Ukrainian leadership to its great credit, does care. They have to balance preserving territory,
      winning the war and not losing too many people on the battlefield. But I think they’ve been very
      clever about things that look asymmetric like these sea drones. They’ve been very clever about how
      they fought the war so far. And again, so I think so long as we subjectively act as though they can
      win the war, I think they can eventually win the war. And I mean, to be clear by winning the war, I
      don’t mean that they’re going to drive out every Russian soldier off every square centimeter of
      Ukrainian territory. It’s that I think a system like the Ukrainian one actually has more staying
      power than a system like the Putinist one. And war ends when politics buckles, it ends when one side
      or other can’t sustain it any longer. And I think if the Ukrainians have support, the weaker side in
      the end is going to be the Russian side.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s it. So interesting. I want to get back to us being the weak link, which I mean is a
      terrible thing as an American, I’ve got to say, to acknowledge. But it’s true, I think for now. But
      have you been surprised, I mean, you’re a student of, and I think mostly an admirer of modern or
      current Ukraine or current being even a couple of three, four or five years ago. But have you been
      surprised by just the performance of their— the country, the system, the government, the civil
      society? It seems pretty impressive and awfully admirable, but—
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      I was one of… This question is a little awkward. It’s awkward when you’re right. It’s not awkward
      when you’re wrong in American public because when you’re wrong, everybody just forgets it. Right?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Well, I’ll put it in a better way then. I guess knowing much less sort of was pleasantly surprised.
      So tell me why, explain what was happening in Ukraine that people like me didn’t fully grasp.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, I publicly said Zelensky is going to stay and they’re going to fight. And that basically got
      laughed at by the American Foreign Policy Establishment. And so, I did think he was going to stay
      and they were going to fight. I didn’t think they would do as well as they ended up doing. So here
      I’m going to join in your expectation. I want to start there somewhere else, which is why, I’m just
      going to pose it a different way, which is why didn’t we take Ukraine seriously or to put it in the
      sharpest possible term, why was our expectation the same as Russia’s expectation? Because both
      inside the Kremlin and inside the Beltway and inside the Beltway among both Republicans and
      Democrats, the expectation was Ukraine is going to fold in a few days. And why did we have that
      expectation? And I think that expectation arises from the deep fundamentals, the imponderabilia, the
      things that come before we even start talking about history or strategy or politics. I think that
      comes from a kind of very deep Russian subjective victory, which is Americans and most people in the
      West until 2022, somewhere deep down thought Russia’s a real place and Ukraine is not a real place.
      And then from that, without actually saying that out loud, we reason forward to “whatever, they’re
      corrupt, it’s a new nation who knows..?” like something that we are willing to say out loud. And
      then from that we reason to, “they’re going to flee.” And I think it’s that deep unspoken thing
      which was basically mistaken. And that’s where maybe I had an edge over other people because I
      studied the place. In the last 30 years, Ukrainian civil society has become more and more active and
      self-aware. And this is relevant for Americans too, successful at defending and pushing democracy
      forward because democracy doesn’t just happen as we like to think. It unhappens, democracy naturally
      unhappens, you have to make democracy happen. And Ukrainian civil society step by step has managed
      to not only sustain, but make democracy a little bit less imperfect over time. And it’s that same
      civil society then, which is behind the army, which is fighting the war. And it’s that same state,
      which has gotten— you know, it’s not perfect, but it’s gotten better and better over time rather
      than worse and worse, which is fighting this war. And then of course, I think they were fortunate
      with their leadership too. I mean, it’s kind of an argument for democracy that somebody as
      improbable as Zelensky would win an election. Then people like, “Okay, well, this guy, he’s just,
      what can he do?” But it turns out that thinking in terms of how to communicate and thinking in terms
      of the grand stakes are things that a properly trained actor can do. And that turned out to be very,
      it’s still very important, but very important in the first year. But I think fundamentally it comes
      down Bill to just this basic notion that Ukraine’s actually a real place, and Russia isn’t the thing
      that it’s convinced us that it is. It’s something which is more fragile and more new.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s great. I mean, in Ukraine, a Ukrainian friend of mine, acquaintance of mine here in DC,
      we were having a long conversation about this and she was asking why Americans don’t understand sort
      of that this is not only worth fighting and worth winning and worth helping them, but it’d be hugely
      important to have a stable, free, liberal democratic Ukraine right where it is as a real ally and
      it’s a positive. It’s not just doing the right thing and helping a country that’s dealing with a
      terrible neighbor. It’s actually a huge strategic advantage. I don’t know if maybe that’s just our
      wars over the last, God knows, 50 years Vietnam and Iraq and Afghani— we’re helping people who I
      think we could argue were on the better side of these conflicts against dictators and so forth. But
      it was more us trying to do the right thing and help them. And as she put it, well, as I mentioned
      Vietnam, she said people need to think of Ukraine as West Germany, not as Vietnam. That’s not quite
      right. But I mean, as a big country, that will be a very important ally in fighting for freedom and
      democracy in the future, not simply as a place we kind of have intervened to try to help do the
      right thing.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, I mean, this is the problem is that we don’t actually have an analogy, and I mean there are
      two differences, but with Iraq, and these are places where you and I may disagree, but in Iraq, we
      actually intervened militarily, which we didn’t do in Ukraine, we’re not going to do. And what we
      did, we did on false pretenses. And so that’s meant that we lost a lot of credibility with our own
      people and then also with others. And so then you come around to a situation like Ukraine. I mean,
      it’s kind of like a fairy tale, right? It’s like the crying wolf or something. You come around to a
      situation where the wolf really is there. And the situation actually is really simple because that’s
      the thing about Ukraine, which is unusual, is it’s both its strategic and its moral simplicity. And
      people don’t want to think that it’s simple. They want to think, “Oh, wait, somehow this is part of
      a conspiracy, or this is somehow Vietnam or Iraq or somehow,” but it’s actually, it’s not really
      like those situations. It’s a country which is defending itself, and we’re kind of helping on the
      margin, which is a good thing. But we haven’t really been in that situation before. There aren’t
      that many situations where democracies are defending themselves, right? I mean, Great Britain in
      1940.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, Britain in 1940 is for me, as this war began, has been going on for me, is the one that just
      stands out.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, right. I mean, there’s Czechoslovakia in ’38 where the democracy should have helped, but
      didn’t, and then there’s Britain in ’40 where we should have, and we did. But there aren’t that many
      cases like this where really all we have to do is give them a meaningless percentage of our defense
      budget and they’re going to win. And yet somehow we get ourselves tied up in these incredibly
      complicated arguments, which really don’t even need to happen. And the Ukrainians are understandably
      befuddled by, and this is our, I think maybe our central strategic weakness and one that the
      Russians certainly exploit, our everyday assumption that it’s all about us no matter what’s
      happening in the world. It must be about America in some sense. And whether you’re on the left,
      whether you’re on the right, I think this is kind of our national weakness. And if you assume it’s
      all about you, then you spend a lot of time thinking about how it’s all about you, and you get
      yourself tied up in arguments among yourselves about how it’s all about you. Rather than just
      saying, “Okay, there are other people in the world who have agency, the Russians have agency, they
      decided to invade Ukraine, the Ukrainians have agency. They decided to defend themselves. What now
      makes sense in terms of our own interests, both moral and political in this situation?” And there
      are many things which have been wrong with our response, but I think that’s a big part of it. Again,
      regardless of where people start out politically, is that we have trouble seeing that situations are
      not primarily about us.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. It was not until, I think, after February 24th, 2022, that I went back and looked in a little
      more detail at America First in 1940. And I of course knew about it, but I kind of assumed America
      First had been going in ’38, ’39, and then more famously in 1940 with Lindbergh and so forth. And I
      didn’t realize America First, the committee, the actual America First Committee was started after
      the invasion of the Low Countries and of France in 1940, and when the Battle of Britain was roaring
      in the most dramatic moments, really, of it. So the people in the US, the political forces in the US
      who wanted us to stay out, which slid very quickly into sympathy with Nazi Germany, were more
      sympathetic after the brutality and after all the excuses about its German parts of Czechoslovakia
      or whatever had collapsed, and after it was perfectly clear what was happening. I don’t know quite
      what… you’ve thought a lot about the psychology as it were of freedom and tyranny. I don’t know. I
      was just so struck by this. I had sort of had a naive view, I think, that they kind of stumbled into
      an untenable position by late 1940. They chose that untenable position in late 1940.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      I appreciate your saying that because it’s such an important point, and I’m going to answer it
      starting from somewhere completely different and then work my way back. If you look at far-left
      sympathy for Stalinism and for the Soviet Union, when does it start to splinter? This is a story you
      know better than me probably, but the left, the European left, the North American left starts to get
      uninterested in Stalinism when there’s no longer mass violence. So, it’s not that the far-left… I’m
      talking about the extreme left now, like the communist left. But it’s not that people like the
      Soviet Union despite the violence. They liked it because of the violence. And this is something
      which is very hard… we don’t want to think this. We want to think everybody’s basically a nice
      liberal or whatever, a nice conservative. We want to think people are basically decent souls and
      sometimes they’re misled, but actually there is a taste of blood that people like, at least at a
      distance and sometimes in proximity. And so the reason that I’m referring to why people didn’t find
      the Soviet Union as sexy in the ’60s as they did in the ’30s, is that it’s consistent with what
      you’re saying. Abstracting away from the politics, it makes sense, actually, that people liked Nazi
      Germany after they realized what it really was. And this is what’s happened with Putin’s Russia as
      well. If you look at the people who are now going to Russia or who are now vlogging for Russia on
      the internet. These are people who like the fact that Russia’s killing lots of Ukrainians. They like
      the fact that Russia’s trying to prosecute a genocide. They like the fact that Russia’s pushing for
      a world where might makes right. They like that. There’s a certain number of Americans who
      like—people around the world, people who are not Americans who matter in America—who like this. And
      that is unfortunately the appeal of, I’m going to use the word fascism. That fascism is about
      saying, “Look, it’s all about the one guy. It’s all about this one guy who’s beyond history. Look at
      him. He’s breaking all the rules.” And yes, of course there’s killing involved, but that’s
      necessary. It’s a normal. It makes us feel good. And that’s what we’re dealing with now. It’s a big
      part of what we’re dealing with. And although it’s not always explicit on the Trump side of things,
      it’s also part of the Trump side of things, where Trump is about how there’s a strong man. It’s all
      the succession of strong men. He doesn’t pretend to be the strongest of strong men. He’s kind of a
      link on a submission chain where Putin is obviously higher than him, but for him it’s ultimately
      about who is strong and who is not. And the fact that the Russians are killing so many people in
      Ukraine, there’s so much bloodshed, is clarifying. It’s because that is in fact what people like.
      It’s not just that they’re tolerating it, it’s what they like.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. That for me has been such a revelation of the Trump movement as well as the war now in
      Ukraine, that this sort of psychological appeal of fascism. Fascism, broadly understood. Not
      literally necessarily ’20s, ’30s European fascism, but that’s something… I don’t know. I had the
      more conventional, I was an anti-communist. And then the Cold War ended and then we had various… I
      was on the interventionist side, liberal interventionists, conservative interventionists side,
      depending on the Balkans and Middle East. But I don’t know, I somehow put that out my mind. You
      didn’t because you studied, I think, that part of the world. So that’s infinitely more than I had.
      But I think it’s a real… that’s not a happy revelation, but it’s one that one should’ve of course
      known all along, I guess.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah. It’s interesting that we dropped it in the US because the whole anti… In the ’80s we got
      ourselves… I’m just looking at this back… in the ’80s I was a teenager, so I’m not making an
      intellectual history point, but I think in the ’80s, with Reagan, the anti-totalitarians got
      themselves all focused on communism. Whereas originally the anti-totalitarian position, the Cold War
      liberal position which then bled into the neo-comm position. But originally that position was an
      anti-totalitarian position and not an anti-communist position. But as time went by and as domestic
      politics changed, it kind of morphed into this anti-communism position and the anti-fascist pit was
      in the background. But I think that snuck up on us. And it’s not just an intellectual history
      problem, it’s also that because… we didn’t think about how fascism always arises at home. If you’re
      just going to be an anti-communist, that means, okay, then the enemy’s on the left or it’s across
      the ocean or whatever. And you don’t think, okay, well, here I am a conservative. Let me look to the
      right and just make sure that there’s not anything over there dangerous which is going on. And I
      think that was a bit of a mistake. Another thing I’ve been thinking about is how, during the Cold
      War, they were always calling us fascists.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      And we were always kind of saying, “They’re like Hitler.” We were always using the Munich analogy.
      And I think that also tamed people’s sensibilities a little bit, that if you’re constantly being
      called a fascist, you don’t think, oh, well, maybe actually I am or my friend is or we could be. And
      so we’ve I think we’ve missed elements in our history which enabled that sort of thing. And the sad
      thing is that others haven’t. The Russians haven’t missed it. They’ve been trying to cultivate that
      in us and cultivate that generally.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. This is a whole different discussion we should have some time on that
      because I think it’s very shrewd about the history of American thinking and American foreign policy.
      There wasn’t… the fascist regimes that are out there, or semi-fascist or whatever. Nasty right wing
      regimes weren’t threats in the way the Soviet Union was to anyone else in particular, mostly, I
      would say in the ’70s, ’80s, Pinochet, whatever. And some of them democratized, and we did a little
      bit to help with that. We thought of China as, maybe incorrectly, still as communist, not as
      fascist. And then Putin, we were slow obviously in adjusting to. So there was about 20 years there
      where Milošević, I think there was a liberal conservative internationalist alliance to stop that in
      Europe. That was kind of… and again, but it’s funny, I don’t recall, and I was pretty involved in
      that in ’95, ’96, or even earlier, objecting within the Bush administration in ’92 to our doing
      nothing. But I don’t recall that we really thought of it as fascism, though I think that would not
      be a bad term, would it? For that. That was a real early indicator that fascism was a possibility,
      and an aggressive possibility, in a post-Cold War world.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      I think that’s an excellent point. As I recall it, the move that we often made was to say, “These
      guys are somehow invested wrongly in the past,” which of course fascists are. Fascists have the
      cyclical view of the past and restoring greatness. And in that way, Milošević really was… he was
      somebody who talked about both… he does the thing which Putin does now and which Trump does now,
      which is that you somehow are both always the victim and you’re always the victor at the same time.
      Like everybody’s always against you and somehow it always turns out well, and whatever you do is
      okay because you’re always already the victim. But yeah, I don’t think, in coming out of the ’80s
      into the ’90s, a lot of the people that the United States had backed during the Cold War would have
      been called, if we had not been backing them, fascists. And so that’s one reason why we’re not
      sensitive to it. But I think the main reason we’re not sensitive to it actually is a lack of
      reflection about our own history. I think that’s really where we… that’s our real problem. It’s not
      anybody else, the problem is us.
  - speaker: Biill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. And certainly someone like me who’d been on the conservative side, I feel like I’ve personally
      learned a ton about… and I knew this of course at some level, and I was pro civil rights and
      everything. But still, about the south and the reconstruction. And it’s been useful… not useful. I
      hate to say it that way. It’s a terrible, bad history and terrible to have to relearn it under these
      circumstances. But really looking at what happened in between, I don’t know, 1870 and 1900 or
      something in the south, and the combination of using the laws and changing the laws, and then the
      extralegal militias and so forth. It’s very reminiscent of… I think there the American
      exceptionalism led us wrong, too. We had blinkers on about some of that.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah. Well, I think folks who were coming to political maturity in the late ’60s can say, “Okay, now
      we’ve got this right.”

      Right. Yeah. “We’re on the right side of civil rights and we’ve…” yeah.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      If we fix it, it’s all done. But of course things that happen after civil rights, like mass
      incarceration and voter suppression, are actually continuations of that tradition, unfortunately.
      But the thing I wanted to say, going back to an earlier point you made, is that the racism is
      connected to the America First stuff. Lindbergh’s… The reason why Lindbergh likes the Nazis is that
      he wants to have, and I’m paraphrasing him now, but he wants to have a fortress of white people that
      are going to hold back the black and brown people. His fantasy is that we have a technological
      advantage across the Atlantic and, together with the Germans, we can basically keep the brown and
      the black people out of our countries. That’s it. And it’s direct organic. And you see that direct
      organic connection too, the folks now who talk about America First or isolationism very often bleed
      into or are quite openly on the wrong side when it comes to race. And then just as a footnote, it
      helps to look at the Russians because the Russians, there are things about us they don’t get. And I
      think Trump is going to pay for the Russians having too much influence on his campaign this time
      around. But they don’t have any hesitation about seeing things about us that we might hesitate to
      see. And so they understand that our isolationism has to do with racism, and they feed that. They
      feed that constantly. So I see them as kind of a bad doctor. They’re a doctor who wants you to die,
      but nevertheless their diagnostic skills are not so bad. They can figure out what’s wrong with you,
      and then they try to make it worse, right?
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, well—
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      But they see that the racism and the isolationism are the same thing. And I think that’s a point we
      should probably also be taking.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. No, that’s important. Yeah. Well, good poisoners know the same things as good doctors. I think
      it goes back to Plato and stuff. Just one last… I want to get to action, what’s likely to happen on
      the ground and in Russia and Ukraine and so forth in a second. But one last minor semi-political
      theory point, almost going back to my studies many years ago, but people my age, and I certainly was
      so influenced by Hannah Arendt and The Origins of Totalitarianism and the whole left-right
      horseshoe, they’re both totalitarians, and so much in common. And there was some truth, I think
      considerable truth to that, perhaps. And many people wrote eloquently about it. And in that respect
      we did understand that there’s Nazism in Soviet communism, but I think fascism’s not quite the same
      as Soviet… it’s not quite as… it needn’t be maybe as totalistic, I guess you’d say, as communism was
      in terms of the real desire, allegedly at least, to shape people’s every thought and so to speak, so
      forth. And I feel like there… I wish I had known more about fascism—qua fascism—and less about
      totalitarianism as a big concept.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And which incidentally made it seem like all fascism is Nazi Germany, which is not quite right. For
      me, that Umberto Eco essay, which you must know very well, from, what is it? ’95 I think, Ur-
      Fascism, and which focuses, maybe because of where he’s from, on Mussolini, as in a way, the
      instance… and he was really the originator of it, right? In Europe.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, of course.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      That was a very revelatory for me, that you can have an unbelievably nasty and brutal regime. It
      doesn’t quite look like what Hannah Arendt describes totalitarianism as looking like. And I guess
      that is Putin’s Russia, right?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah. I would agree with most of that. I think, yeah, Arendt’s book is brilliant, and it’s been very
      important conceptually for me, too. And a lot of my work, including Bloodlands, which you kindly
      mentioned, is about agreeing but disagreeing with Hannah Arendt or starting with some observation of
      Arendt’s… and she’s, I think unquestionably, one of the extraordinary political thinkers of that
      century. But you’re right that she’s taking not just the Soviet Union, she’s taking Stalinism. If
      you look at the Soviet Union under Brezhnev in the ’70s, it’s a very, very nasty place, and there’s
      still a gulag. But it’s a smaller gulag, and it’s a country which has given up on this total vision
      of the future. But she’s writing about Stalinism. Likewise as you say with fascism, she’s writing
      about Hitler’s Germany. What she says about propaganda narratives, and the way that they fold all of
      reality into one big lie, that’s much more true of Nazi Germany than it is of fascists in Romania or
      even fascists in Italy. I think your point about the pluralism, as it were, of fascism, the
      plurality of fascism is really important. Fascism is built to fit each national tradition. It takes
      the national and turns it into the irrational, and therefore it’s going to look different in each
      case. Also, because it’s not built around a party. Of course individuals matter in the communist
      tradition as well, but in the fascist tradition, it really is the individual who sets the tone and
      is supposed to set the tone. It’s the leader, the strong man. Fascism is supposed to be different,
      and it is in fact different. That leads us to these debates, which I think you’ve just kind of cut
      through where people say, “Well, is it really fascism? Because let me give you a list of 11 things,
      and maybe it only meets…” That misses the point, because fascism isn’t really about being rational,
      it’s about being irrational. It’s about will over reason, and the leader, and the single party. But
      the party’s not a party, it’s a movement. It’s not about institutions, it’s about turning
      institutions into something else. Yeah, I think your point is very helpful, because I think Putin is
      a fascist, and I think it’s taken way too long for people to realize that. And the fact that we
      haven’t realized it has disabled—as I see it, this is maybe more my world than yours—but it’s
      disabled a lot of people on the left. One of the heartbreaking things for me about the last 10 years
      is that I see all these people who regard themselves as anti-fascist. Okay, if you’re an anti-
      fascist, that means not that you deny that fascism exists, it means that when it’s there you oppose
      it. I see a lot of people who I feel like you missed your chance, or you’re missing your chance. If
      you’re an anti-fascist, you should go to Kyiv right now and show solidarity. That’s what you should
      be doing, because there’s fascism in the world, it’s carrying out a genocidal war. Likewise, in the
      US, a lot of people on the far left take a view of like, “Well, how do I tell the difference between
      Biden and Trump?” I can think of ways you can tell the difference. There are ways in your own
      tradition where you can tell the difference. But if this whole fascist vocabulary is somehow self-
      limiting and no one wants to use it? Then I think if you’re on… Again, this is not exactly my world.
      But if you’re on the far left and you have a taboo on fascism, or you deny it exists or whatever,
      then you’re going to have a harder time talking about somebody like Trump where there is a cult of
      personality. Where he’s turned the… I’m sorry to say this, but he’s turning the Republican Party
      into a personality party. When it’s like you’ve got people with the same last name as you who are
      supposed to run it, and it’s going to fund you? It becomes then a personal institution like a
      fascist party. But if you don’t have the vocabulary, then it’s harder to criticize that. Anyway, I’m
      taking your point. Look, there are many different kinds of fascism, and that’s not an observation
      one would necessarily get out of the Arendtian tradition.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah. On your point, for me, Ukraine is the most important issue in American domestic politics,
      partly because it really is such an important issue for the world in many ways, and therefore for
      America. But also because it’s so revelatory, it seems to me, about people’s actual views about
      America. Almost a little more than America itself, where you can find excuses not to see certain
      things, or there’s someone… You know what I mean?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      This is so clear cut.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, I agree. It’s a litmus test, and there aren’t… The interesting thing is it doesn’t ever really
      go wrong. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, and I will tell you what you think about
      voter suppression. Tell me what you think about Russia and Ukraine, I will tell you what you think
      about a whole range of other issues. You can tell. You know this better than me, but with
      Republicans, it’s really striking. For me, the people who have… Because I have spent a lot of time
      the last couple of years talking to Republican elected officials and others about Ukraine. The
      people who have a moral vocabulary about Ukraine also have a moral vocabulary about the US. It may
      not be my moral vocabulary, but they have one. There’s some set of moral commitments out there.
      Whereas the people who diminish Ukraine, or who try to push it aside, or who repeat Russian talking
      points, they also don’t have the moral vocabulary about the US. About the US, it’s also always about
      criticizing, dismissing, making fun, mocking. There’s nothing positive there.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, no, it’s so true. The tradition of liberalism, of a liberalist that was anti-fascist and anti-
      communist… I was talking to actually a Democratic member of Congress who I phrased, I think on TV or
      something, just sounding like Scoop Jackson. I said, “My first vote was for Scoop Jackson in a
      primary in 1972.” I was a Scoop Jackson Democrat before I was a Reagan Republican. I didn’t know him
      that well, but he called up and said, “That was nice what you said about me. But maybe you could say
      Hubert Humphrey, and not Scoop Jackson, because Scoop Jackson’s a bridge too far for my friends here
      in the Democratic Party.” I’m amazed people even know who he was mostly these days, but it was a
      funny conversation. But Humphrey, I then actually went and read a little bit about Humphrey, whom I
      admired as a young man. But I didn’t remember that much about his pre-history from before I was born
      as mayor of Minneapolis. Humphrey was really absolute anti-fascist, and absolute anti-communist, and
      put his own career on the line in both cases incidentally, and at home and abroad. Fought
      antisemitism as mayor of Minneapolis when they were… It was not popular to do that. Was a huge, of
      course, civil rights leader, and was willing to split the Democratic Party in ’48 at the convention
      on that. Threw the Communists out of the former Labor Party, and I don’t remember exactly when, late
      40s in Minnesota. But had of course defined himself in before that as an anti-fascist. There was an
      admirable tradition there, and people were able to do both of those things at once, it seems like.
      Maybe that will come back. Maybe say a word about Russia. What’s the prospects there? How firm, how
      strong is Putin? Anything to hope for there? Then about the actual… I’m curious what you think about
      Ukraine itself, but also about its neighbors. The European situation as we move forward. Then we can
      come back to the US, which, as you say, is both the key and sadly maybe the weaker link.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Okay. Let me just pick a segue out of what you said, because I think… You’re teaching me things I
      don’t know about Hubert Humphrey. There’s an awful lot I don’t know about US history. I’m an
      American and a historian, but I’m not an American Historian, and I have a lot to learn. But it
      strikes me that in order to be an anti-fascist and anti-communist, the most important thing is you
      have to have a positive vision of the American future. The thing which Russia traffics in, and how
      Russia will win ultimately, is futurelessness. Their politics is a politics without a future. It’s a
      politics which is built entirely on myths of the past. The war they’re fighting against Ukraine is
      not really based upon some vision of how things will be better if we conquer Ukraine, it’s based
      upon a lack of vision. We don’t really know what we are, and therefore we have to destroy them,
      because destroying them gives us a sense of what we are. Everything is us and them, and since we
      don’t know who we are, we have to have the “them.” All the emotional energy, all the political
      energy goes against them. That can obviously sustain a war for a while, and it has sustained a war
      for longer than I think a lot of people expected. I think things are going quite badly for Russia,
      and I think the way that the only place they’re really winning is in the American mind. Not just the
      American mind. The only place they’re winning is in people’s heads. They’re not really winning on
      the battlefield. They’ve smartened up from their initial invasion, which was based on this entirely
      false political premise. But they’re still losing an awful lot of men in order to take a relatively
      small amount of territory, and they’re doing badly, as we talked about before, in the air and on the
      sea. Politically, I’m not really sure what their explanation is for going on for another year. I
      think they’ve plateaued. They’ve hit this plateau, where Russians think the war makes sense because
      people have died. It’s precisely that. Because my son has died, because my husband has died, because
      my brother has died, there must be some reason for it. That will keep you going for a while, but it
      won’t keep you going indefinitely. I think they’re going to have a hard time getting to 2025, and
      that’s why they’re so heavily invested in us right now. That’s why we’ve heard so much about how
      they’re winning, and Ukraine is losing, and let’s all throw up our hands. This whole fatigue thing,
      everyone’s supposed to be tired, which I think is completely ridiculous. What are we supposed to be
      tired about? We’re just sitting here watching and occasionally voting on something, that doesn’t
      make you tired. I think Russia’s in trouble, and I think they are… This is unpleasant for us, but if
      we don’t see it, we’re never going to. They see Capitol Hill as the shortest route to Kyiv. That’s
      how they see it, and we have yet to prove them wrong about that. Their politics are, in a sense,
      very closely related to our politics at this point, because they are counting on Mike Johnson and on
      Donald Trump to get them through. That’s their plan. Their version of victory is that we lose focus,
      we lose attention, we don’t fund, and then they wear the Ukrainians down with the help of the North
      Koreans and the Iranians.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Yeah, they see Capitol Hill and then the 2024 election, obviously presidential, as their two-step
      path to victory. But yeah. No, it is striking. You think that’s very explicitly in their mind, that
      if things went differently on Capitol Hill and in 2024 it would have a pretty big effect in Russia?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Oh yeah, yeah. I know you know all this—
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      No, no.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      …forgive me the little lecture. In the US we really do live in our own… We have bubbles within a
      bubble, but there’s one big American bubble, and in that American bubble we have all these other
      bubbles. But then on the American bubble we just often… I just put it very bluntly. We often just
      don’t recognize that there’s a world out there which is communicating to us very clearly. The
      Russians pretty much every day in their own propaganda talk about how great Trump is, and how great
      the Speaker of the House is. We might not like that, we might not pay attention to it, but it’s
      right there before our eyes. They literally go on screen in front of millions of their own people
      and say rah-rah when there’s not a vote for Ukraine aid. They’re not really hiding it from anybody,
      that this is what they’re up to. Their propaganda is basically an alternation between we’re trying
      to destroy the Ukrainians and, oh look, we have new pets in America, which is how they describe the
      people who do what they want. Because they simultaneously praise them, and they’re incredibly
      condescending about them as well. They refer to Trump, for example, as Nashatrampushka , which is
      our little… I don’t know, like “our little Trump darling” or something. They praise American
      political figures, but also in the sense that they’re just these things we cuddle because we like
      them so much. That’s how they talk about Tucker Carlson as well. He’s very courageous compared to
      the other Americans, but he’s also completely our person. It’s broken his head a little bit. Yeah.
      Sorry to take so much time to answer it, but it’s just a really simple yes. They make it 100% clear
      that this is what they’re doing, and it’s only… They know, unfortunately, that we’re so narcissistic
      that we don’t even notice. Anyway, for those of you viewers who want to notice, Julia Davis does a
      terrific job on her and her writing, and in her Twitter feed and on YouTube on just summarizing
      Russian propaganda day-to-day. If there’s any uncertainty about this stuff, she’s very helpful on
      this.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      And you read her. I read her on Twitter, it’s so astonishingly both vulgar and… I don’t know,
      simpleminded isn’t even the right word, it’s what’s what you’re saying. There’s no artistry, and
      condescending to their American stooges, and that seems to have no… Not to hurt them much, and I
      think maybe it’s important for them at home to show that we are in charge, and maybe we have these
      fellow… I think the Soviets were a little this way too to their fellow travelers. They didn’t
      actually treat their somewhat stooge-like fellow travelers here in the US or in Western Europe with
      great respect, right?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      It’s a very funny mix I think in both cases. I’m sorry, part of my mind is now thinking about how to
      translate Nashatrampushka . Now thinking of “Trumpkin Dumplin’,” something like that.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Oh, that’s good, yeah.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      But yeah. In both cases, there’s this mixture of authentic fear of American power. And then… because
      this is one of the odd… Taking a big view, I don’t know if you’ll agree. But objectively, the
      comparison between US and Russia now is nothing like the Cold War.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Right.
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Right. There’s this discourse of multipolarity, which I accept is more valid with respect to China.
      But if it’s just a US-Russia thing, there’s no bipolarity anymore. The differences in power on every
      dimension except the nuclear, and the nuclears, for most purposes, are relevant, the difference is
      so extraordinary. And so it’s a mixture where they are very afraid of the US, because they know if
      the US actually gets its act together, essentially we can win the war in… It sounds very
      condescending, but we could win the war on Ukraine without noticing. The amount of help we have to
      give to the Ukrainians, which would be very significant for Ukraine… I mean, remember the Ukrainian
      economy is about 1/250 the size of the NATO economies. Russia’s about 1/25 the size of the NATO
      economies. And so if we actually just had a consistent policy, the scale of which wouldn’t even be
      noticeable in our budget, we could win. And they know that. They know that. And so then whenever
      they get their useful idiots, the relief is so great that it kind of bursts into hilarity. Like,
      “Oh, look. These people could crush us with a little finger, but look, they’re not going to because
      we’ve got Tucker and we’ve got Nashatrampushka , you know? We’ve got these people.” And so their
      relief manifests itself in this kind of hilarity, in this kind of like, “Oh, well, look. The world
      is actually set up in such a way that we don’t have to win. There are these people who are going to
      come and help us out.”
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      Eek. Say a few words about Europe. I mean, generally there are crosscutting trends and tendencies in
      many different nations, and obviously the different nations are very different. But what’s your
      general sense there, and particular things that either alarm you or cheer you up?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      I mean, in general, the Europeans are doing better on Ukraine than Americans think. And just to…
      There’s a lot of discussion about GDP per capita spending on defense as a percentage of GDP, sorry,
      and that’s a Trumpist discourse. But if you look at percentage of GDP spent on the Ukraine war, the
      US is way down the list. Like, we’re below Bulgaria. We’re below countries that we don’t even think
      are on the Ukrainian side. We’re below Malta. We’re below the Czechs. We’re below pretty much
      everybody on that measure. And even if you take the total, the Europeans are now way out ahead of
      us. Different measures are slightly different things, but they’re way out ahead of us. So I mean,
      just as a starting point, it’s important for Americans to realize that we’re not actually leading.
      We could be and we should be, we really should be, but we’re not. But it’s not… The Europeans lack
      what we have. They don’t have all the stuff on the shelf that they can give away, and our
      manufacturing capacity should be much greater than theirs, although it’s not because we haven’t made
      the right choices. In Europe, it’s like different countries at different points are doing the right
      thing. At the beginning it was the East Europeans who had been right all along and who then kind of
      threw what they had at the situation. You have kind of steady in the background the Norwegians, who
      have infinite resources. And then you have the Germans who, in an incredibly painful set of
      contortions, which are unbelievably frustrating if you follow them, and if you know anything about
      German history. Because if you know things about German history you know that actually Germany has a
      very profound historical debt towards Ukraine, which they’re only very slowly realizing is the case.
      Germany is very, very slowly, too slowly, very slowly going in the right direction. And then you
      have the French who have been basically… Macron has seen, as generations of French leaders before
      him have seen, when there’s a moment of American weakness, that’s a moment when France can play a
      disproportionate role. And Macron, I think he’s doing exactly the right thing in exactly the right
      rhetoric, and I’m glad he is doing it, but it’s really striking that the Gaullist moment arrives
      when the Americans are busy doing nothing. But what Macron… I mean, the French are doing less than
      other countries, but what Macron is saying now is very important because he’s the one who’s saying,
      “This is very clear morally, and this is also very clear strategically,” and he’s right about those
      things. So I think the Europeans can get the Ukrainians through this year without a disaster. But if
      we want the Ukrainians to win, and if we want… We haven’t really talked about this, but there are
      all these strategic gains which the US gets by Ukraine winning. If we want that, the Americans are
      going to have to come in and help.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol
    text: |
      What about domestically though in Europe? I mean, how worried do you about Orbanism? I mean, some
      countries seem… Czech Republic, very impressive, sort of repudiated a Trumpy type president. They’ve
      got half a million Ukrainians who seem to be doing fine. There’s not much resentment so far as from
      what I can tell. They’re being treated well and so forth. Hungary, kind of Orbanism, where do you
      see the domestic trends there?
  - speaker: Tim Snyder
    text: |
      Yeah, that’s interesting. Because if you take it as a whole, it’s kind of like the US, where you
      have a strong and increasingly organized minority, which is pro-Russia, pro-Putin, pro-Russian
      victory, pro-fascist. And it’s not a majority anywhere, but, on the scale of Europe as a whole, it’s
      significant and it occupies certain important posts, like for example, the post of prime minister in
      Hungary. And from those posts, it can cause disproportionate damage or it can slow things down. And
      then a couple more of those posts. And then you’ve got real problems. Again, it’s like the US. You
      don’t have to have a majority which is anti-Ukraine, but you have to have a few blockers in
      position, which is what Putin is aiming for and what he hopes for. Public opinion in… It’s like the
      US. Public opinion in Europe varies from country to country, but it’s basically pretty good, and
      it’s remarkably good given that it’s been two years and given that… And this has been a media
      discourse, which I really dislike. Given that since March of ’22, too much of the media has been
      telling us how we need to be tired. Which is… It’s kind of the worst of all possible forms of
      journalism, because it’s not even a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s meant to be a self-fulfilling
      prophecy, and it’s like now it’s up to us to say, “Oh, yeah. I read that headline and now I’m tired
      because I read this headline about how I’m tired.” But given all that, the public opinion is not
      bad. And I tend to think that… There are a lot of European countries, there are a lot of elections,
      some are going to go well, some go badly. The Polish election went the right way. The Czech
      presidential election, as you said, went the right way. The Slovak one went the wrong way. The
      Italian ones seem to go very much the wrong way from the point of Ukraine, but actually she’s been
      fine with respect to Ukraine, right? So there’re going to be elections. There’s going to be a
      British election and Labour is going to turn out to be exactly the same as the Conservatives on
      Ukraine, maybe even a little bit better. So with the exception of Germany and France, things are
      going to go back and forth, but I think basically it’s going to be okay. Where we’ll really have
      trouble is if Le Pen wins a presidential election in France or if the AfD comes to power in Germany.
      In those scenarios, then Europe itself is going to have trouble.

      Yeah. Let’s close by talking about the US, which you said was the key link and the weak link, I
      think you said, or potentially. Well, maybe right now the weak link, and potentially the very, very
      weak link. What I was struck by I was in Europe a few times, a year ago meeting with pretty senior
      Germans and I think the [inaudible] is more real than not, a little more glass half full than half
      empty and especially the younger Greens in Germany have been excellent. It’s funny, I said to one of
      them at the end of a meeting, “I never thought when I was a Reagan Republican that the party I would
      like the most and admire the most really in Germany would be the 40 year old Green leaders and not
      the CDU or for that matter SPD leaders. But when talking to senior Germans from the foreign policy
      defense world, what was striking to me was—one forgets this again in one’s solipsistic American
      way—we have just all these capabilities. We are a global power. We have intelligence. We have a ton
      of weapons. We could make a lot more and probably should be making more. We have many, many things
      we can do. No European country is even remotely set up that way. Their individual companies run,
      they do very good things, individual militaries that are extremely impressive, I would say, of the
      Balts and the Nordic states, and so forth. There are many great things. I’m not being at all… all
      diminishing them by comparison. It’s just as a factual matter, and the degree to which we can help
      in sort of day-to-day conduct of the war compared to… We’re set up to fight wars and to deter, and
      we’ve done quite a lot of fighting of wars, smaller ones, thank God, in the last 50 years. And
      obviously no European country has really. So in a very practical way, I was struck by the
      indispensability, if I can use a Madeleine Albright phrase, of the US, as well as the broader
      political way as well. But anyway, say a word, we’ll close. But say a word about the US in general
      and what you would say to fellow Americans, or what prospects you… What worries you the most and
      cheers you up, if anything, the most.

      Well, let me just pick up where you started then I’ll go somewhere else. I mean, the striking thing
      about us helping the Ukrainians is that we could help… Most of the stuff we’re giving Ukraine is
      stuff we were going to throw away.
  - speaker: Bill Kristol

      Right.

      The systems that we’ve been giving Ukrainians are stuff which was obsolescent and which American
      taxpayer dollars were going to spend to take apart and throw away. And what we’re doing right now by
      not doing anything is we are basically throwing away systems, which from our point of view are too
      old, instead of giving them to the Ukrainians. The HIMARs that the Ukrainians have been using to
      great effect are things that we would never use because we were going to throw them away. And so it
      goes to this point that we have such… We have, in principle, all this military power and we make
      ourselves laughable when our actual capabilities are so ludicrously off our theoretical
      capabilities. I mean, that’s why the Russian propagandists have trouble containing themselves, is
      that the stuff that we’re going to… It’s this. The stuff that we’re going to throw away would be
      enough to help the Ukrainian army defeat the Russian army. But we can’t get ourselves together
      politically enough to give the Ukrainians the stuff we were going to throw away. And that’s why they
      laugh at us. And I mean, that may be unpleasant, but we have to break out of it. Sometimes you have
      to… Other people can help you to see ourselves. And so yeah, the US should be able to help Ukraine
      win this war. I mean, now switching from the Russian point of view to ours, I guess the main thing
      that… The main switch I wish we could make is I wish we could say, “Wow. In the last two years, the
      Ukrainians have done a lot for us.” They’ve defended the international order. The basic principle of
      international order is that countries shouldn’t be invading other countries and changing territory.
      They have held off, in large measure, a genocide. Wherever the Russians occupy, they have been
      killing people, kidnapping people, raping people. Holding off a genocide is not something just that
      Ukrainians are doing for Ukrainians. It’s also a contribution to a better world. The Ukrainians are
      fulfilling the entire NATO mission, basically on their own. There won’t be a war in Europe so long
      as the Ukrainians are fighting the Russian army, because there’s no way the Russian army can fight
      another war. If Russia defeats Ukraine, of course, it can. And in my view anyway, they’ve made a war
      with China much less likely because they’re showing how offensive operations are complicated and
      unpredictable, and a Chinese Communist Party that doesn’t want to be embarrassed is going to pay
      attention to that. And the Ukrainians are showing that there are people out there in the world who
      are willing to take risks for democracy, which is a pretty important example, I think, for us and
      for everybody. They’re doing all those things for us. I think that’s where the conversation should
      start. And then it’s like, “Okay, well then what are we doing for them? For this strategic bonanza
      and this moral example, what are we doing in return?” I think that’s where the conversation should
      be starting. Because as I see it, I mean, there are a lot of reasons to care about Ukraine, and I
      care about Ukraine as such. But even if you didn’t, if you’re just an American concerned about
      American interest, there’s a kind of unusual strategic opportunity here where so many things are
      possible for so few resources. And even if you’re just a hardheaded American realist, this is a
      historical opportunity which you’re never going to see again, and I wish people would care about the
      moral issues. But even if they don’t, I wish people would care about our own interests, because our
      own interests point in exactly the same direction here.

      That’s such an excellent point and eloquently stated, and I think an appropriate place to close. But
      we should get back together maybe after… Hopefully things look more promising in November 2024, and
      maybe we can talk more about the future and about a brighter future. Whereas I think, as you say, so
      well, I mean this… 2024 could be a real turning point, not just for Ukraine, but for all of us. I
      mean, couldn’t it be a real inflection point in world history?

      Yeah. And it can still be a good one. It can still be a good one. Yeah. Thanks for reaching out.
