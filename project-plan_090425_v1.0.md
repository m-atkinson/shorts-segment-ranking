## Notes
- the alias for our virtual environment is env
- git@github.com:m-atkinson/shorts_model_v3.git
- We need to create a solid naming convention for everything. 
- We're gonna use git and commit after every feature. 
- We're going to clean up during and after every session, i.e. delete shit we don't need.
- We're going to create clean and updated documentation.
